"1",15,"AFG",40,1985,"I wish at the outset to congratulate the President warmly upon his election to preside over the fortieth session of the General Assembly. While offering the full co-operation of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  we sincerely wish him success in the discharge of his responsibilities.May I also put on record our appreciation of the esteemed Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his devoted efforts to uplift the role and effectiveness of the Organization.On the grievous and sad occasion of the tragedy that has befallen the people of Mexico  we express our deep sorrow and sympathy to the bereaved families of the deceased and to the people and the Government of Mexico.of the basic principles of the policy of the Democratic Republic ofIn less than three seeks we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization. That provides us with a fitting opportunity for reflection on which of the most important tasks set before the Organization by the signing of its Charter have been accomplished; what have been the causes behind the failures to fulfill certain of its other responsibilities; and what are the prospects for exploring new avenues to make the United Nations fully responsive to those needs and aspirations for which it was initially created.A glance at the 40 years of service by the United Nations gives us sufficient reasons to assert that it has become an indispensable instrument of international life. Its achievements  although limited and modest  have been of immense importance in reshaping the whole content of international relations.The United Nations  which was given the ptIsaacy role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in furthering international economic co-operation  acquired a very important position in managing international relations through the application of the norms and principles of international law crystallized in its Charter.Great hopes were attached to the creation of a new world which  despite the divergence of ideologies and socio-economic systems  would be governed by the rule of law and adherence to the principles of the non-use of force and peaceful coexistence. Four decades later we take note with satisfaction that  thanks to this Organization  we have been able to prevent the outbreak of another world war. That cannot  however  diminish our regret at the fact that almost 150 wars and armed conflicts have taken place since then at local and regional level  some of which are still continuing. Although limited in scope and dimension  these conflicts have already claimed more than 20 million lives  which is more than all the military casualties of the Second World War.The emergence of the community of socialist countries out of the great victory over Hitlerite fascism and Japanese militarism at the end of the Second World War fortified the central bastion of the forces of peace and progress  and it has served as the main ally and staunch supporter of all national liberation movements throughout the world. This new phenomenon gave an entirely new essence to the nature of international politics  making it impossible for the forces of imperialism and colonialism to dictate the destinies of mankind according to their own selfish interests.The most outstanding and praiseworthy work of the United Nations was undoubtedly the setting in motion a quarter of a century ago of the process of decolonization  which led to the accession to independence of dozens of Asian  African and Latin American countries. The collapse of the system of colonial empires became the inevitable outcome of the long and fierce struggle of the colonial peoples and countries to throw off the shackles of dependence. This historic process ushered in a new era based on the principles of equal sovereignty and equitable co-operation. New spirit and blood were injected into the soul and the veins of the Organization  which made it  with the passage of time  a truly universal body.The United Nations and more than 35 of its specialized agencies have been engaged in an admirable effort on behalf of the international community to attain the distinct and varied goals that were prescribed for the solution of the most acute problems affecting our world. Although the outcome of these efforts is far short of the initial expectations  what has been achieved could not have been accomplished save through the Organization.The activities of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the field of the economic development of developing countries probably constitute one of the salient features of the multilateralism forged by the United Nations. Of great value also is international co-operation in the field of education and health. The progressive development of legal instruments in the field of human rights has had a significant impact on the improvement of the human rights situation in various countries and regions.Our rejoicing over the successes of the United Nations cannot and should not cause us to lessen the vigor with which we seek to enhance at a more rapid pace the role and effectiveness of this world Organization. Some may assert that the relative inability of the United Nations to consolidate international security and find appropriate solutions to the problems affecting the international political and economic environment emanates from shortcomings in the Charter of the United Nations. It is our belief  however  that the Charter represents the transcendent interests of all Member States. It is  rather  the lack of political will on the part of some Member States fully and scrupulously to implement the Charter that has led to the continued failure of efforts to bring about a better life in conformity with the vision of its authors and signatories.One major example of such unacceptable and deplorable conduct is certainly the misuse of the veto power by the United States and some of its allies. The ever more frequent exercise of this right has resulted in deliberate disruption of the increasingly emerging consensus on some of the topical issues of our times  Palestine  Namibia and South Africa being the more obvious ones.It is true that the United Nations has had a great impact on the formulation and progressive development of international law affecting almost every aspect of international relations; but at the same time it has been prevented from effectively implementing all these instruments in State-to-State relations.Despite the many great efforts made  the system of international security is as fragile as ever. The present international political and security climate is characterized by an awesome concentration of potentially explosive situations  each of them fraught with the danger of plunging our world into a terminal nuclear conflagration whose menace is already looming large over mankind. The advent of the atomic age  marked by the first atomic bomb explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki  brought about a dramatically different notion of war. Since then the world has witnessed hitherto unknown quantum leaps in the sphere of the means of death and destruction. It is frightening to know that some of the new types of weapons possess more power than all the conventional weapons used in all the wars in history. It is  further  horrifying to learn that thousands upon thousands of such weapons have been stockpiled in the military arsenals of the world.Yet the arms race seems to have increased in pace  dimensions and magnitude. New types of weapons of mass destruction are continually being developed and manufactured. New and additional grounds are sought for the stationing of these weapons in different territories and continent. Together with the unleashing of the arms race* a world-wide campaign has been launched to undermine the process of detente and to promote horrendous military doctrines justifying the concept of ""security through strength"". This is in fact a well-organized attempt at psychological preparation in the service of imperialist doctrines of ""limited"" or ""protracted"" nuclear war.The hard-won agreements on some major aspects of the curbing of the arms race - for instance  on anti-ballistic missiles - are threatened with being unilaterally sunk in the Lethe. The obstinacy characterizing imperialist positions on other aspects of the arms race has justifiably dispelled hopes that reason will prevail among the imperialists. It becomes more and more evident that the verbal profession of peacefulness by imperialism is grossly at odds with its conduct. These conditions have instilled a pervasive atmosphere of enormous suspicion and fear.In his annual report this year  the Secretary-General has rightly stated:""He face today a world of almost infinite promise which is also a world of potentially terminal danger. The choice between these alternatives is ours ...""The world is still  admittedly  a very imperfect  insecure  unjust  dangerous and  in all too many regions  impoverished place."" (A/40/1  pp. 2  3) He cannot but lament the fact that some very important issues which could have unacceptable consequences for international peace and security are still being allowed violently to disrupt the political serenity of regions and the world as a whole. The question of Palestine  where the situation has lea to many destructive wars in the entire region of the Middle East  has been before the United Nations almost since its establishment. One night have argued that the enormity of the death and destruction suffered by the Palestinians and other Arab peoples should have persuaded those responsible for the continuation of this unfortunate situation to embark seriously on the path of peaceful solution. One would have hoped that common sense and realists would have made it clear that there simply cannot be in that region.a lasting peace that is both just and comprehensive unless the Palestinians  under the leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization  are guaranteed the effective exercise of their inalienable rights and the aggressor is forced to withdraw from the Arab territories it has illegally occupied since 1967.The international community owes it to itself to sake a determined effort-through the convening of the proposed international conference on peace in the Middle East  to bring tranquility and harmony to that war-ridden region of the world.The people of Namibia  who have been longing for their emancipation from more than a century of colonial oppression  are still being denied  by artificially injected  extraneous and irrelevant issues set as preconditions  what all of us take for granted as our birthright.The same evil that has chained Namibia has been responsible for the tears and blood being profusely shed in South Africa. It is a till possible for the despicable and abhorrent apartheid system to reign with impunity in the streets and localities  the mines and plantations  of South Africa. In addition  Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe  Lesotho and Botswana have remained permanent targets of coercion and intimidation by the same racist regime. The peoples of South Africa and Namibia  under the banner of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  are now on their final march towards smashing the ugly face of the colonialist apartheid system and consigning it to the ash-heap of history.In Latin America a combination of imperialist policies is at work  providing a spectrum of direct military aggression and occupation  as in Grenada and Guantanamo; of mercenarism  armed interference and sabotage  as against heroic revolutionary Nicaragua; of political and economic coercion and blockade  as in Cuba and other countries; of sustaining unpopular oppressive regimes  as in Chile  El Salvador  Guatemala and others; of turning countries into military outposts or launching-pads of aggression  as in Honduras and Costa Rica; and of colonial occupation  as in Puerto Rico  the Malvinas Islands and elsewhere. All sorts of conspiracies are hatched to undermine the genuine and sincere efforts of the Government of Nicaragua and the countries of the Con tailor a Group to restore peace and stability in Central America. One cannot fail to see that the hand of United States imperialism is at work behind all the cases I have enumerated  although in some instances more use is being made of local surrogates.In the conduct of its international relations the United States imperialism has pursued  and it continues to pursue  a course that flagrantly violates the obligations it assumed under the United Nations Charter and other multilateral and bilateral treaties. It has trampled upon every norm of international behavior in a lust to achieve its own imperialist ambitions. It has in most instances ignored or acted against the expressed will of the overwhelming majority of nations by misusing the authority vested in it as a permanent member of the Security Council. It has blocked many international efforts to find just solutions to some of the very explosive and dangerous situations in various corners of the world. It has prevented the achievement of understanding on certain important global economic and social issues that have burdened the international community for many decades. It has launched a vicious campaign of vilification against the concept of multilateralism and has already begun to carry out its threats to withdraw from the system of international organizations. It has developed its own narrow-minded concept of national security  which encompasses virtually all regions of the world as so-called areas of vital interest to the United States.In total contrast with the aspirations and endeavors of the forces of peace and progress  it has effectively prevented the achievement of meaningful accords on curbing the arms race and implementing real and comprehensive measures aimed at nuclear and conventional disarmament. In its quest for world supremacy it has spread its armaments and military presence to most parts of the globe. Its warmongering and aggressive policy finds the planet Earth too limited an area for the full implementation of its militaristic designs  and it has thus launched the star wars plan  declaring outer space to be the new environment for its strategic arms spree  despite the strong condemnation of world public opinion and the United Nations.In this context we hail the new and timely initiative of the Soviet Union on international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space without its militarization  aimed at the realization of the star peace concept  as well as its declaration of moratoriums on the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe and on the testing of all nuclear weapons.For the purpose of building the world's largest and most destructive arsenal of strategic and conventional weapons the United States has recklessly squandered thousands of billions of dollars which are badly needed to fight the numerous economic and social ills of the world. It has engaged in the plunder and exploitation of the human and natural resources of the developing countries through transnational monopolies and has crippled the economies of those countries with the enormous burden of mounting external debt and soaring debt-servicing.Cynically portraying itself as the champion of human rights  it has by its deeds grossly violated those rights  and not only in its own country; it has closely identified itself with monstrous regimes infamous for their blatant breach of the minimum standards of respect for the dignity of the human person.Its hallucination concerning a new European and world map drawn to satisfy its long-term policy of aggrandizement and complete world domination has led to the deliberate fomenting of neo-fascist revanchist claims in Europe and unbridled militarism in the Far East.It has launched direct military aggression against other sovereign countries and master-minded and carried out plots and intrigues to overthrow their national and independent Governments. Upgrading terrorism to the level of State policy  it has designed and implemented many assassination plots against the leaders of other countries and has used every opportunity to undermine the social  political and economic fabrics of those countries. Insulting the conscience of entire nations  it has put their national liberation movements on a par with terrorism  while at the same time it has awarded the title ""freedom fighter"" to some groups of professional killers  terrorists and mercenaries who are bred  nurtured and sustained by its own devilish spy networks. The acquisition of a semblance of legitimacy for all these unlawful deeds constitutes the crux of the incessant activities of the United States aimed at building its information imperialism through unrestricted expansion of its means of propaganda  slander and fabrication and by its rigorous opposition to the efforts of the overwhelming majority of nations to establish a new international information order. In short  United States imperialism has opted for a course of all-out militarization  confrontation  aggression  diktat  interference  exploitation and unilateralism.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan vehemently condemns such a course and calls for the increasing and co-ordinated action of all peace-loving countries and forces firmly to reject and oppose imperialist policies which  if allowed to continue  will inevitably lead to the extermination of life on earth. The recent Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Luanda has adopted certain action-oriented decisions in regard to these matters which  in our opinion  could become the basis for positive action by the General Assembly.The continued occupation of parts of Cyprus by foreign troops and the futile attempts to lend legitimacy to an artificially created entity in the northern part of that island have rendered inconclusive the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and of the Secretary-General aimed at preserving the unity and independence of that non-aliened country.In South-Bast Asia  where for many years imperialism trailed upon the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of States of the area  a new life has slowly but surely emerged out of the smoke and ashes of the dirty imperialist war against Viet Nan and Laos and the bloody reign of the Pol Pot clique in Kampuchea. The Chinese hegemonists have become a party to the international conspiracies against the three peaceful Indochinese nations  conspiracies which have made it impossible for their peaceful demarche to give effect to the concept of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia.The Korean people are also denied their legitimate right to peaceful re-unification  because of the presence of United states troops in the southern part of the country.Over a million people have been reported to have fallen victim to the five-year long war between Iran and Iraq. One wonders how many more will be required before reason can prevail and help to bring this senseless fratricidal war to an end.The efforts of the international community  particularly the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  to turn the area into a zone of peace  are being hindered by the increasing military build-up of the United States. We take this opportunity to express our firm support for the draft resolution submitted by the non-aligned members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean calling for the convening of the long-due conference in the first half of 1986.Notwithstanding the great achievements in the field of decolonization  we have yet to clear our conscience by doing all that could be done to help free the people of those dependent territories which constitute the last vestiges of colonialism.Peoples of the Saharoui Arab Democratic Republic  New Caledonia and Micronesia have yet to be fully assured of their right to self-determination  while territories such as the Malagasy Islands  Hayotte  and the Chagos Archipelago still wait to be restored to the sovereignty of their respective countries.The longest crisis in the economies of capitalist countries  and its devastating impact on the economies of the developing countries  particularly the least developed ones are posing a serious threat to the economic  social and political stability of those countries. The crisis is undoubtedly no mere cyclical phenomenon  but a symptom of deep-sooted structural imbalances and disequilibrium that characterize international economic relations. Protectionism  interest rates and debt servicing burdens have been on the rise  while commodity prices  official development assistance and reliance on multilateral co-operation continued to decline significantly. The shrinking real value of resources available to multilateral development institutions is in fact tantamount to a deliberate attempt  by the capitalist countries  at a gradual erosion of the multilateral framework for development. For most developing countries  this adverse external environment has meant stagnant or declining growth rates.Bleaker prospects are to be awaited in 1986. According to some authoritative forecasts  the expected slowdown in world trade will threaten the transition to export-oriented adjustment policies in the developing countries. This would in turn drastically reduce the ability of those countries to adhere to the schedule of repayments of their external debts and debt services. The least developed countries will have to go through even more difficult times. We hope that V he mid-term global review of the implementation of the Substantial New Program of Action for the least developed countries  to be held from 30 September to 11 October this year  will provide an opportunity for adopting measures aimed at specific positive action towards the effective implementation of the Program.It is only logical that sore attention should be paid to the problems of those least developed countries whose development efforts are further hampered by their geographical disadvantage as land-locked countries.We condemn the continuing use of economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion. This alarming trend  which creates tension and distrust in international economic relations  undoubtedly disrupts the world economy and trade and undermines its legal foundations.We are concerned by the intransigent position of some capitalist countries on the launching of global negotiations  which has led to persistence of an impasse on this issue in spite of the inherent flexibility of the two-phase approach proposed by the New Delhi Summit. In our opinion  more vigorous pressure must be exerted on the developed capitalist countries in order to overcome the present lack of political will on their part and to establish a new international economic order based on justice  equity and co-operation.The noble and valiant people of Afghanistan had suffered for centuries under the oppressive and despotic regimes which represented the interests of a tiny privileged minority in society.Favorable changes in the balance of forces at the international level and the gradual maturity of internal conditions provided the material basis for a fundamental change in the nature of Afghan society. An instrumental role in this process was played by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  which through its persistent struggle had become the authoritative vanguard of our people.In accordance with the laws of history the evolution of socio-economic factors culminated in the creation of the momentum that led to the inevitable victory of the national democratic revolution on 27 April 1978. This constituted the final victory of the beneficial forces of progress and justice over the medieval forces of darkness and reaction.The fundamental and drastic reforms introduced by the young revolutionary Government stand as brilliant and irrefutable proof of the popular and democratic essence of the revolution  a revolution that was launched and carried to success with the support of the people of Afghanistan under the leadership of the People Democratic Party of Afghanistan.Every day that passed strengthens the popular foundation of revolutionary power. The recently held Loya Jirgah  or Grand Assembly of the Peoples  the elections to the local organs of State power and administration and the convening of the High Jirgah - or Council - of Frontier Tribes constitute landmarks in the process of transferring power to the masses.Imperialism  which had never abandoned its hope of dominating Afghanistan and bringing that country under military-strategic influence  redoubled its efforts to create chaos by provoking anti-government activities.By pouring hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of weapons and ammunition into the hands of counter-revolutionary mercenaries  imperialism  hegemonism and other reactionary forces had unleashed a dirty undeclared war against the people  the Government and the revolution of Afghanistan.Faced with the ever-increasing threat of massive armed invasion and direct aggression  the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan had no other choice but to take appropriate measures to safeguard the independence  national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. In conformity with the Afghan-Soviet Treaty of Friendship  Co-operation and Good-neighborliness and Article 51 of the United nations Charter  the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan requested and received from the Soviet Union friendly military assistance to help the Afghan people and armed forces repel outside interference and aggression.The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has made it clear on various occasions  including in the two proposals of Hay 1980 and August 1981  that the Soviet limited military contingent would return to their peaceful country  by agreement with the Government of the Soviet Union  once the causes for their invitation ceased to exist and valid international guarantees are offered for their non-recurrence.Consistent with its peaceful foreign policy  the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has participated  with the utmost sincerity  in the process of the negotiations which are being held through the intermediary of the representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Diego Cordoves. While reaffirming our support for this process  we earnestly hope that Pakistan will abandon its rigid position and agree to the holding of direct negotiations between our two countries. This  in our opinion  is the only viable path to an amicable solution in the interest of all peoples of our region. We wish to address ourselves once again to those who still cherish the illusion of forcing Afghanistan back to its past: no evil power on earth will be able to deter the valorous and free-born people of Afghanistan from following their independent and non-aligned course. As Babrak Karaal  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and President of the Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  stated at a recent meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party:""As an independent  non-aligned and peace-loving country  the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan firmly and undeviatingly respects and observes the principles of the United Nations Charter  believes in good-neighborliness and desires the solution of problems in an atmosphere of peace and friendship on the basis of common sense and a logical approach through direct and mutually beneficial negotiations."""
"2",54,"AGO",40,1985,"Allow me  in the first place  to express to you. Sir  my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are sure that the choice is intended not only as a symbolic tribute to your country but also as a way of expressing appreciation for your qualities as an experienced diplomat  one who has always firmly asserted your connection with the ideals of peace  equality and understanding among the peoples and nations of today's international community. We wish to express to you our best wishes for your success in the accomplishment of your important task and our conviction that your responsibilities will be performed in an exemplary manner  and with dignity.We wish also to express our heartfelt esteem to the outgoing President  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the clear-headed and dignified way in which he carried his mandate throughout the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  for praiseworthy professional qualities  which dignify both his own country and Africa as a whole  and for the important role he has always played within the African community in making a most positive contribution to the cause of African unity.We would like to reiterate to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our deep appreciation and admiration for his efforts directed to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations  giving heed to the concerns of all peoples and nations  small and large  and thus helping to bring about just resolutions of disputes and conflicts which threaten international peace and security in different parts of tho world. We very much appreciate his example of courage and unselfish dedication.I would like to join with the countries which have already delivered their message here and  on behalf of His Excellency President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and of the Government and people of the People's Republic of Angola  to assure the Mexican people of our sympathy and solidarity and to express our condolences to the bereaved families who lost loved ones in the 19-21 September earthquakes. We trust that  with the support of the international community  the Mexican people will  as in the past  be able to overcome this hardship.The world is currently experiencing growing international tension created by militaristic policies and the belligerent practices of imperialism  which sustain the escalation of the uncurbed arms race in all forms  including nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  thus irrefutably increasing the risk of nuclear war.The People's Republic of Angola thinks that the States which possess nuclear arms  together with those equipped with massive weaponry  should negotiate the achievement of effective measures conducive to an immediate reduction of their armaments expenditure. The adoption of specific measures towards disarmament should save considerable resources that could be used directly for the improvement of the critical economic and social situation in developing countries. The forthcoming meeting of the top Soviet and American dignitaries will constitute an opportunity to examine possible paths towards a new era in the universe  with more concern and renewed hope in relation to the problems of peace and co-operation for the benefit of all  and the establishment of a new  and more just and equitable  international economic order.The People's Republic of Angola acknowledges the significance and importance of the environment and of science in terms of Antartica's potential  and reaffirms the need to extend co-operation to the Antarctic region without discrimination and for the good of all mankind. In our view  Antartica should continue to be used exclusively for pacific ends.The current international economic scenario is characterized by a profound crisis whose causes are rooted in the present structure of international economic relations  which is based on inequality and dependence  with disastrous consequences for the economic situation of developing countries in particular. While world commerce registered an increase of 9 per cent the developing countries were experiencing a recession in their economies because of the manipulation of the terms of trade  a fall in commodity prices  protectionist measures and increased interest rates  which made it difficult for those countries to retain their international solvency and consequently the stability of their balance of payments.A number of other factors are responsible for the worsening of the economic situation in the developing countries  particularly those of the African region. An unprecedented famine crisis can be witnessed today in our continent  with hunger and poverty striking a large number of people. The situation is made worse  on the one hand  by the poor technological capacity for the prevention of the effects of natural disaster  as in the case of land impoverishment  drought or hurricanes; and  on the other hand  by the lack of realistic action in implementation of development programs  which consequently become impracticable.In 1984 African countries faced an external debt amounting to $158 billion  and in the current year estimates show an increase of 3 per cent even if restrictive measures are adopted by some of them in order to cut it down. The solutions to be adopted must necessarily focus on modern technology transfer  which can generate increased agricultural development  and implementation of an industrialization process for the transformation of the exportable basic products of those countries.There is therefore a need for joint action to find appropriate forms of economic and financial co-operation in order to overcome the current debt situation. We consequently reaffirm our support of the decision of the Heads of State of the countries members of the Organization of African Unity which stressed the need for an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of debtor and creditor countries  on reform of the international monetary system.In the context of the importance of economic development being accompanied by social development  we laud and fully support the global initiative on the immunization of all children by 1990  a worthy endeavor in which Governments and United Nations agencies are co-operating. Taken in the context of the current international political scene  the situation in southern Africa is becoming more and more alarming in view of the increasing hostility of the illegal apartheid regime of terror  whose existence constitutes an offense to the world conscience and a threat to international peace and security.We are today seized of yet another open invasion of the People's Republic of Angola by South African regular armed forces. In fact  neither the earlier resolutions of the Security Council nor Security Council resolution 571 (1985)  of 29 October 1985  have been implemented  because of the arrogant intransigence of racist South Africa.From 30 September until now  new bombing attacks and the occupation of parts of our territory have taken place  as stated in the text of the message by the President of the People's Republic of Angola addressed to His Excellency the Secretary-General of the united Nations from which I quote:""I would like to inform you that the security conditions in south-east Angola continue to deteriorate dangerously as a result of the growing interference of South African armed forces in the internal affairs of Angola and of the direct involvement of the South African armed forces in aggressive military actions against the Angolan people and its sovereign nation.""In addition to the air raids of 17 September and the intervention of battalion Buffalo in military operations against the Angolan forces  which the Angolan Government condemned and denounced at the time  pointing out the material damage and the loss of human lives caused  I am herewith reporting a new South African offensive  with the intervention of military forces whose number has not yet been determined and which were landed in the territory of the People's Republic of Angola from Namibia  the territory illegally occupied by South Africa. These forces are located in the vicinity of Mavinga  250 kilometers from the Namibian border  and they have already launched several aggressive actions against our military units using Mirage aircraft and taking advantage of the lesser experience of our pilots in areas far away from their runways. Specifically  the treacherous  murderous attacks took place as described below just as our ground forces were breaking through the third and last defense line of the UNITA puppets as they entered Mavinga town: first  on 28 September five South African planes flew over locations where our forces were positioned between 9.50 and 5.48; secondly  on 29 September the South African planes flew again for lengthy periods over the locations where our troops were positioned; thirdly  in the early morning hours of 30 September  between 3 and 6.20  a formation of more than eight planes from the South African air force raided our positions and caused more than 50 casualties among our troops  as well as dozens of wounded men  and brought down six Angolan helicopters.""In addition  our infantry soldiers clashed with South African armed forces in direct combat.""It can be verified that South African artillery units are in Angola to attack our armed forces which have been engaged in the establishment of peace and security in that region of our country. The pretext presented by racist South Africa does not convince anybody any more  not even those who defend the policy of constructive engagement.South Africa does not respect the most fundamental principles of international law- Pretoria's soldiers make incursions into areas of my country that have never sheltered Namibian refugees. This was the case in Cabinda  where United States oil interests could have been harmed if it had not been for the prompt intervention of the Angolan defense forces  which neutralized the special racist commando unit whose mission it was to destroy the Malongo oil installation in Cabinda  a province situated more than 2 000 kilometers from the Namibian-Angolan border.The actual situation is characterized by the direct intervention of the South African army against Angola with the objective of defending the puppets of the so-called UNITA  long since denounced as the South African army's surrogates  whose objective is to destabilize Angola.On the other hand  the apartheid regime is doing everything possible to extend violence across the whole region in order to divert the attention of the international community from the serious situation in South Africa  where the black majority and other groups are determined to end a system that is inconceivable in the 20th century.The South African regime is the main cause of the tension and destabilization experienced by the States in southern Africa. South Africa continues to violate the resolutions of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  with the help of certain Western countries. The recent statement made by the united States Secretary of State before this General Assembly is a clear demonstration of the encouragement given to South Africa to pursue the policy of destabilization in our region. It is now high time for the Reagan Administration to demonstrate without ambiguity on whose side it stands: on the side of the sovereign States of southern Africa Members of this Organization or on the side of the apartheid regime  which is condemned by the international community  including a growing number of American citizens. The Government of Pretoria cannot prevent the liberation of the Namibian people by a facade of alterations  declarations of states of emergency or the blackmailing of neighboring countries.With regard to my country  there is no civil war in Angola. Rather  there is permanent aggression orchestrated by Pretoria  and joined by a group of ambitious Angolan traitors motivated by anti-patriotic  tribal and racial interests.The Government of the People's Republic of Angola follows a policy of unity oriented towards the integration of all its citizens without discrimination. He reject categorically the pretended reconciliation with armed factions manipulated by and acting on behalf of the apartheid regime.When Pretoria claims that the climate of tension and aggression created in southern Africa is a regional expression of the East-West conflict  that is nothing more titan a justification of the reinforcement of the military aid it has been receiving to impose its political and economic diktat by force of arms on the independent countries of the region which do not conform to its political system.The Cuban troops are in Angola at the request of the People's Republic of Angola under an agreement subscribed to by two sovereign and independent States.As the international community knows  South African racist troops are illegally occupying the Territory of Namibia. Thus  the Cuban presence in Angola* which South Africa considers to be an obstacle to peace in southern Africa  is on the contrary a guarantee of stability and peace against Pretoria's expansionist designs. But in spite of the ambiguity and dishonesty of some of our partners  we are willing to pursue our efforts to achieve peace in southern Africa.Our country has followed with a certain apprehension the evolution of the situation in other points of the African continent  for instance in Chad  where its people is in the midst of a serious crisis caused by multiple acts of foreign interference. We are therefore happy that the OAU is continuing indefatigably its efforts in favor of independence and national unity and to bring about a constructive dialog between the parties involved.As far as Western Sahara is concerned  we think that the development of direct negotiations between the parties and the holding of a referendum so that the Sahraouri people can exercise their right to self-determination  in conformity with OAU resolution 104 and General Assembly resolution 39/40  are the instruments for the settlement of the dispute.As for the Middle East  we must point out that the Palestinian issue remains the core of the crisis in the Middle East. Just and lasting peace cannot be achieved without recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian Arab people to return to their homeland and establish an independent  sovereign State on its own national territory.To that end  and in conformity with the recommendations of the Geneva Declaration on Palestine  we think that the holding of an international conference on the Middle East  with the participation of the parties involved  namely the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and permanent members of the Security Council  would certainly help create a climate of peace and stability in the region.Meanwhile  very recently  in open defiance of the international community  Israeli armed forces committed an aggressive act against Tunisia  once again showing its true terrorist nature by presenting the most fallacious arguments to justify that criminal action. We vehemently condemn this aggressive act.In the Persian Gulf we continue to witness an escalation of the war between two brother countries  both members of the Non-Aligned Movement  the consequences of which are tragic in terms not only of loss of human life but also of the destruction of economic infrastructures. We therefore strongly urge the belligerent parties to seek a peaceful  just and honorable solution  in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement  in order to restore peace  security and stability to the region.In Central America aggressive action by imperialist forces is ever present. A constant threat hovers over Nicaragua and we regret that certain countries of the region have taken a hostile position in relation to Nicaragua  helping the United States in actions aimed at destabilizing that sovereign country  a Member of the United Nations and a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  through terrorist and armed forces.The People's Republic of Angola supports Nicaragua in its struggle to maintain its territorial integrity and its efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement of the Central American conflict. Our country also fully supports the peace efforts of the Contadora Group.The People's Republic of Angola urges all States in South-East Asia to co-operate in order to avoid new threats to peace and security in the region  and to adopt measures to create favorable conditions for permanent  balanced and harmonious relations among the countries of the region  in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence  respect for sovereignty and national independence  territorial integrity and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.In East Timor  we understand that progress is being made  through dialog between Portugal and Indonesia   with the mediation of the Secretary-General. We trust that the legitimate interests and inalienable rights of the people of East Timor will be safeguarded in this process.Rising from the ashes of a war that killed many millions  and caused mankind enormous material losses  which even today can still be felt  the United Nations has helped to avert new wars and major conflicts. The preservation of international peace and security is a vital need of mankind. This Organization is an instrument with the ability to guarantee satisfaction of that need  forming an appropriate forum in which to find solutions to the most complex problems of international relations today  in particular those related to colonization  development  peace and disarmament.During the last 40 years  from 24 October 1945 to today  the United Nations has played an important role in the history of mankind  promoting the fundamental rights  self-determination and independence of peoples  as well as co-operation between developed and developing countries.We would like to express our hope that the noble objectives for which the United Nations was created will be implemented on the basis of justice and the equality of Member States.The struggle continues. Victory is certain."
"3",101,"ALB",40,1985,"First of all  I should like to congratulate Mr. Jaime de Pinies on behalf of my delegation for his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. We wish him every success in carrying out his important duties.I wish to extend to the people and Government of Mexico the deep sympathy of the Government and people of Albania and to express our feelings of solidarity and sympathy for the losses caused by the earthquakes which have struck that country.This year  the General Assembly is meeting at a significant time for the United Nations - that of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization's founding. Even in the heat of battle during the Second World War  when the forces of the anti-fascist coalition of peoples were fighting to overcome the Nazi fascist hordes  the foundations of the United Nations were being laid.The peoples of the world who paid with their blood for the war prepared by the imperialist Powers aspired to build a better and more just world on the ruins left by the war. They hoped that the United Nations would also play an important role in this endeavor.From the very first lines of its constitutive act  the United Nations proclaimed as its fundamental purpose! the preservation of international peace and security  the liberation of mankind from the horrors of war and the development of friendly relations among nations on the basis of mutual respect.But at this anniversary session of the United Nations  which also offers an opportunity to reflect on the Organization's role and functioning  the delegation of the Socialist People's Republic of Albania is compelled to point out that the period since the Organization's foundation  as well as the existing situation  have shown that the United Nations has not justified the people's expectations  in accordance with the obligations stipulated by the Charter.This is because the imperialist Powers have tried to manipulate and use the United Nations as an instrument to justify their policy of war and aggression. Countless resolutions on very important problems pertaining to the safeguarding of peace and international security have been adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council but have remained mere dead letters in the United Nations archives. The right of veto has been flagrantly abused and has therefore today become synonymous with arbitrary action and injustice. Indeed  during these four decades  the United Nations flag has been used to cover up acts of imperialist intervention and aggression  as in Korea  the Congo and the Middle East  to name only a few examples.By both their policy and actions  the super-Powers have trampled underfoot the principles of liberty and justice sanctioned in the Charter. They have fabricated and put into effect various theories  such as those of interdependence and limited sovereignty  which in reality mean dependence and subjugation.They have responded to legitimate demands for disarmament with a frenzied arms race accompanied by such fraudulent slogans as arms control and the preservation of the balance of power. It is common knowledge that the United Nations was created as a universal organization of sovereign and peace-loving countries and peoples  which the Albanian people - who were among the first active participants of the anti-fascist front - warmly welcomed  immediately applying for membership - a lawful right that was denied them for 10 years as a result of the discriminatory policy of the imperialist Powers and  in the first instance  of the United States.Throughout these 30 years as a United Nations Member  Albania has not failed to make its modest contribution to the cause of freedom for the peoples  peace and international security. We have consistently upheld the view that within and without the United Nations  in international relations  all States - large or small - should be equal. Together with other democratic and peace-loving forces  socialist Albania has opposed the efforts of the super-Powers to manipulate the United Nations and to turn it into an instrument of imperialist policy. Albania has always taken a responsible stand towards this world Organization and has spoken up here with its own voice alone. By expressing its views openly and without reservations  whether or not those views were to the liking of one or the other super-Power  Albania has made a modest contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to fulfill the mission entrusted to it by the Charter.As in the past  the Government of Albania will continue in the future to be an active Member of the United Nations. Consistent in its resolute stand of opposing the super-Powers' policy  Albania will collaborate with the democratic and freedom-loving countries in efforts to safeguard peace and international security and to develop just and fruitful relations among States on the basis of equality and mutual interest.Both our principled and independent foreign policy and the just and resolute stands taken by the Socialist People's Republic of Albania in the United Nations are all indissolubly linked with the name and work of the architect of socialist Albania  the outstanding and immortal leader of the Albanian people. Comrade Enver Hoxha. Under his leadership  the Albanian people fought valiantly against the fascist beast and liberated the country in 1944. They embarked on the road of socialism  and in four decades turned Albania from a semi-feudal country  the most backward in Europe  into a developed industrial country with an advanced agriculture and a flourishing education and culture.Leading our party and people for nearly half a century  he rendered Albania services that make him the greatest and most outstanding figure in the history of the Albanian nation. Enver Hoxha was an indomitable fighter against all forces of regression and an ardent supporter of the struggle of peoples for national liberation  social progress and socialism. Hence for us he will forever remain a hero  a teacher and a symbol of the struggle for the conquest and defense of freedom and independence and the construction of a new life. That is why our party and people are determined always to follow Enver Hoxha's road  because it is the road of progress  freedom and genuine independence for our homeland.I avail myself of this opportunity to express to the General Assembly of the United Nations  on behalf of the Albanian Government and people  our sincere gratitude for the homage it paid to the memory of Enver Hoxha  the leader of the Albanian people  at its plenary meeting on 12 April of this year.For years on end  much has been said inside and outside the United Nations about problems which are of concern to mankind: the rights of peoples to self-determination  the problems of safeguarding peace and opposing war  disarmament  and establishment of equitable international economic relations. The concern of peoples about these matters is as great as it is well founded.It is true that in these 40 years the world has not been engulfed in a global conflagration  but this is no great cause for satisfaction  for the absence of world war cannot be identified with the existence of genuine peace. We cannot forget the fact that during this post-war period the world has seen more than 100 local conflicts and wars  which  in terms of the total number of weapons used and the human losses incurred  stand comparison with the Second World War.It is true that the super—Powers have up to now avoided a direct conflict between them. This has come about not because they wish to spare the peoples but because they fear the catastrophic consequences that such a conflict might have  above all for themselves. Hence  they do not fail to seek and to find temporary solutions through a so-called dialog directed towards what has been termed ""competitive coexistence"" or ""controlled rivalry."" But this cannot be regarded as real security. We need only recall that during most of the post-war period many countries and peoples had to endure again the experience of war  devastation and destruction. Others are still living through the anguish of war or of famine and an uncertain future.The hegemonist policies and militarist course of the super-Powers are leading mankind towards a new world war. The war budgets of the United States and the Soviet Union have today reached astronomical figures. Military bases and nuclear weapons have been placed in every corner of the earth. The skies have been filled with their spy aircraft and satellites and the seas and oceans with their fleets and warships  all of which threatens the peoples and peace.Under the pretext that the balance of power has been upset and must be restored they attempt to justify the build-up of their war arsenals with the most sophisticated weapons and to make preparations for the so-called star wars. We do not wish to minimize the danger posed by the emplacement of weapons in orbiting space stations and the extension of the arms race into outer space  and we cannot but point out that by these means the super-Powers are trying to keep the world and its peoples in a state of constant tension and anxiety about the new weapons they are making. At one time it was the neutron bomb  then the latest nuclear missiles  and now they want to suspend a sword of Damocles above our planet in outer space  thus making mankind a kind of hostage. Thus  they hope that the threat of star wars will cause the peoples to forget that hundreds and thousands of missiles armed with nuclear warheads have been deployed throughout the world and are capable of destroying the earth in a far more barbarous fashion than are space weapons. They also want the threat of star wars to cloud the vision of the peoples so that they will not see Grenada or Afghanistan  not think about Lebanon or the fate of the Palestinian people  and forget Hiroshima and Viet Nam for ever.Both in the East and in the West a great fuss is at present being made about the value and importance of the impending talks between the super—Powers. It is said that the future of peace and of mankind will depend on the agreements reached between them. The United States and the Soviet Union may well sit down and talk together  but the facts thus far have shown that the most they can agree on is making deals  particularly at the expense of the peoples. It is no accident that many of the agreements they reach are kept secret not only from the peoples but even from their allies.The Albanian delegation believes that it is very dangerous to harbor any over-optimism or illusion that the problems weighing upon mankind will be solved by talks and agreements between the super-Powers. Quite apart from anything else  these mean that the role which can and must be played by the Members of the United Nations is being disregarded and that the United Nations is being ignored.The fate of international peace and security cannot be left solely in the hands of those who want to dominate the world. In the present circumstances  the preservation and strengthening of peace demands the forceful denunciation of the policy of aggression and war  oppression and exploitation  and for the rejection of super-Power demagogy  which has spread a fog designed to cloud and distort the true picture and obscure future prospects.A few months ago occurred the tenth anniversary of the signature of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on so-called security and co-operation in Europe. Yet  10 years after Helsinki  Europe is more insecure than ever. This is to be seen also in new developments  in which the focal points of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union are shifting from the periphery to the zones where the borders of the military blocs meet. The euphoria of a decade ago has died away  to be replaced by mutual accusations of non-implementation and violation of commitments undertaken. Albania did well not to attend a conference which  as it was manipulated by the super-Powers  was doomed to failure. Time has shown that we were right.Today the peoples of Europe see clearly that the super-Powers have further pursued their policy of putting the old continent under the shadow of their nuclear missiles and their atomic umbrellas  and that they are behaving in their respective spheres of influence like real overlords. Indeed  even matters of national defense are no longer within the sovereignty of the individual countries concerned.It is obvious that while the military-political blocs of the super-Powers -the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty - exist  there can be no question of genuine security and co-operation in Europe  despite the marathon conferences and meetings held and the fine words spoken.Nor is the situation in the Balkans tranquil; new negative factors are making it even more complicated. National resentments and chauvinistic passions are being stirred up and this creates tensions. It is our belief that the Balkan peoples will not allow the region to be turned once again into a powder keg. They are capable of grasping the situation and of deciding in full sovereignty on the relations between them without falling victim to the intrigues of the imperialists  which would be to the detriment of the interests of each and every people of the peninsula.As for Albania  it will continue as before to pursue a policy of good-neighborliness. As a result of that policy  and through good will and common efforts  friendly relations have been established between our country and Greece  Turkey and Italy. Albania will continue to be a factor for peace and stability in the region. It will not permit any harm to its neighbors or to the interests of peace and security in the region to originate in its territory.The imperialist Powers have turned the Middle East into a region of ceaseless explosions  which have often threatened world peace. For several decades now the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  have been keeping the fires of war burning  sometimes fanning them  at other times letting them die down.It is clear that they want to keep this sensitive region in a state of permanent tension as each strives to hold a dominant position.The tragedy of the suffering Palestinian people has worsened. In Lebanon  Israel continues to sow death and destruction among the innocent people of that country. The intrigues and plots of imperialism  social-imperialism and Zionism in that region have led to a fratricidal war  with extremely grave consequences.We have always believed and now we are convinced that the Arab peoples  with which we are linked by an ancient tradition of friendship  which are known throughout the world as the founders of illustrious civilizations  and which have withstood savage hordes and invasions during their thousand-year history  will be able to demonstrate the power of unity and stay the criminal hand of imperialism and Zionism.The Government of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania  consistent in its position  will continue in the future too to give powerful support to the heroic Palestinian people in its struggle to regain its plundered homeland  as well as to all the brother Arab peoples in their struggle to drive the Israeli aggressors from their occupied lands.The war between Iran and Iraq  which has already lasted five years  must be ended. That would not only be in the interest of the friendly peoples of those two neighbor countries  but would serve the struggle of the peoples of the Gulf and of the region as a whole against the imperialist Powers.It is hard to find a single region in the world today which is not experiencing interference by one or both of the super-Powers. In Central America  the valiant people of Nicaragua is facing an undeclared war on the part of the United States. In Afghanistan  the Afghan patriots continue their armed resistance aimed at driving out the Soviet occupiers. In South-East Asia  the imperialist Powers will not leave the people of Kampuchea in peace to build a free and independent life. The lawful Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is unjustly denied the place in the United Nations to which it is entitled.The Albanian Government supports the just demand of the Korean people for the achievement of its national aspiration for the independent reunification of the homeland without any outside interference.Today the countries and peoples of Africa  which have long experience in the struggle against colonialism  are encountering the interference and trickery of neo-colonialism and the rivalry of the two super-Powers which are striving to dominate Africa. They will not allow the African peoples to heal in peace the grave wounds inherited from centuries of colonial exploitation  but incite conflicts and bloody wars among different African peoples and States who in fact do not have opposing interests but  on the contrary  have a common bond in the struggle against neo-colonialism and racism.South Africa  the bridgehead of imperialism on this continent  where the savage fascist regime of apartheid rules  not only oppresses the Azanian people with fire and steel  but also behaves arrogantly and carries out continuous provocations and aggressions against the surrounding African States.The recent events in South Africa  where the racist regime of Pretoria has perpetrated barbarous massacres  killing and wounding hundreds of people  and imprisoning thousands of others from the black population have aroused profound anger and indignation among honest people all over the world.But we are confident that toe terror and the diabolical maneuverer on the part of the racist regime of South Africa will never be able to put down the just struggle of the Azanian people  nor that of the Namibian people for freedom and national independence. The peoples and countries of Africa have never reconciled themselves to this situation. The Albanian people and Government  who nurture profound feelings of sympathy and friendship for the African peoples  will continue to give unreserved support to their just struggle against imperialist exploitation and oppression  racism and apartheid.The peoples of the world  especially those of Africa  Latin America and Asia  are more and more feeling the heavy burden of the crisis and the exploitation of monopolies and transnational corporations which have in our day replaced the armies of old time colonialists. The colossal loans  which represent a new strategy of the imperialist Powers for the subjugation of countries and peoples  have suffocated the economies of many States and brought them to the verge of total bankruptcy. The industrialized imperialist Powers are using their technological and scientific monopoly as a tool of pressure in order to have the peoples of the developing countries remain backward forever and to intensify their neo-colonial exploitation.The 10 years that have elapsed since the first special session of the United Nations General Assembly on economic problems have witnessed countless meetings and conferences within the framework of the United Nations and outside it  at which the developing countries have asked for more equitable international economic relations. It is precisely during this period that the industrialized Powers have totally disregarded the demands of the developing countries and have stepped up their exploitation  making those countries more economically dependent. A typical manifestation of this grave situation lies in the foreign debts of those countries which  from about $152 billion 10 years ago  today amount to the unprecedented sum of $1 000 billion.Experience is convincingly proving the need for peoples and countries to exercise their sovereign rights over their national wealth.In the four decades of its free and independent development  socialist Albania has advanced with sure steps towards all-round progress and the improvement of the well-being of its people. We are confident that a better future lies aheacJ  for it is based on solid foundations.The experience of socialist Albania has refuted the capitalist outlook that no State can go forward on its own. Our implementation of the principle of self-reliance in no way precludes international collaboration. On the contrary  we have been and are for the development of normal trade  without discrimination  based on mutual benefit. We are also in favor of useful cultural  scientific and other exchanges. In the future  too  we shall extend our collaboration with neighboring countries and other states on the basis of the recognized principles which govern relations among sovereign States.Comrade Ramiz Alia  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly  has said:""Our policy towards our neighbors  as towards all the other States  is a consistent  principled policy. Those who dream about and expect changes in our course  who interpret the normal political and diplomatic activity of our independent and sovereign State as the 'opening up' of Albania  as a 'tendency' to rapprochement with one side or the other  do so in vain. Albania neither 'opens up' nor 'closes up'. It will proceed on the course which it has followed hitherto  a course which has secured its freedom and independence  the defense of socialism  and its good name in the world."" We are confident that the course of socialist Albania and the Albanian people is in harmony with and conforms to the interests of peoples who fight for national liberation  social justice and democracy  for peace and genuine international security.Although we are living in a troubled world  full of contradictions and confrontations  tensions and conflicts  we look into the future with confidence. It has always been our belief that  through the struggle of the peoples and the efforts of democratic and peace-loving countries  the hand of the imperialist warmongers can be stayed and progress promoted. In conclusion  allow roe to assure the Assembly that the Albanian delegation will spare no efforts to ensure that this fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  which has before it many important problems for discussion  will face them with realism and in the interests of the peoples."
"4",169,"ARE",40,1985,"On behalf of the United Arab Emirates  it gives me great pleasure to extend to Ambassador de Piniés ray heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its fortieth session. Throughout his association with the Organization he has made a considerable contribution  which has had an immense effect in strengthening this international institution  we are also confident that his long experience will guarantee the success of the proceedings at this session. For our part  my congratulations assume a special significance because he is a national of Spain  a great country with which we have had good relations based on historical and cultural ties I also take pleasure in expressing sincere thanks and gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  for his presidency of the last session  which was characterized by competence and thorough organization.I also take this opportunity  on behalf of the United Arab Emirates  to reaffirm our confidence in the efforts and good offices of the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in the fulfillment of the aims and purposes of the United Nations.The Israeli act of aggression committed against fraternal Tunisia yesterday clearly confirms the aggressive policy pursued by Israel  its aircraft violated the sovereignty of an Arab State  a member of the League of Arab states as well as a Member of this Organization  resulting in the death and wounding of hundreds of innocent civilians. In condemning the Israeli aggression against fraternal Tunisia and the Palestinian people  we are convinced that such an act of aggression would not have taken place had Israel not enjoyed the protective umbrella provided by a super-Power to shield it against the condemnation of the international community. This aggression coincides with the aggression of the racist regime of South Africa against Angola and confirms the theory of racist solidarity between Pretoria and Tel Aviv.This session is being held in conjunction with the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. It is an occasion for an evaluation of the progress made by the Organization in the preceding years. The purpose is to enable us to strengthen the prospects of success and to eliminate the causes of failure  and to devise new methods consistent with contemporary international conditions  thereby leading to the achievement of the noble purposes for which this Organization was established.It is not our wish to indulge in enumerating the accomplishments of the United Nations. Nevertheless we must shed light on some of them. First and foremost  the Organization offers an international framework for peaceful dialog among its Members. Its founders intended it to be used for the settlement of disputes through constructive dialog  far from the threat or use of force} to achieve universality through the achievement of independence by the colonized Territories; and to protect refugees and alleviate human suffering in regions afflicted by famine and other natural catastrophes. As a result  the role of the Organization has developed with the Increase In its Miter ship and the extension of its functions to include assistance to developing and newly independent countries in establishing their institutions and building their economic and social structures. This assistance has been extended through the numerous institutions and progresses established and sponsored by the united Nations. The organization has also saved the world from the scourge of a new world war  and has become the foundation for the new international economic order and a tool to channel collective efforts to deal with international conflicts and eliminate nuclear confrontation.All those positive achievements must not preclude reference to some of the failures encountered by the united Nations in fulfilling its objectives.Criticism of its weaknesses and lack of effectiveness is basically due to the frustration some feel at the escalating danger of nuclear war and the failure to implement resolutions adopted by the United Nations. This criticism is valid if viewed from the perspective of causes  but lacks merit if viewed on the basis of objectives. The basic responsibility in our view  lies in the absence of the political will of certain States  particularly the major Powers  and their use of pressure  which prevent this Organization from fulfilling its peaceful  humanitarian role.The events in our Gulf region emphasize the need for the United Nations to play its part in the settlement of disputes among States by peaceful means. The destructive war between the two Muslim neighbors  Iraq and Iran  has been la progress for a long time  having entered its sixth year  with the loss of thousands of innocent lives and substantial material damage  at the expense of development in both countries. This has been to the detriment of the well-being of the two nations.From the outset my country has stated its position regarding that war and warned against its detrimental consequences for peace and security in the Gulf region. We have always been and continue to be convinced that the only way to end the war and its destructive effects is by means of peaceful negotiations to settle the problems between the two countries in a manner that will preserve the national rights of both parties. My country has demonstrated its position practically by participating in the efforts to bring an end  once and for all  to this dispute. We are always ready to participate in any serious efforts aimed at the cessation of this bipod-letting conflict. We commend the responsive position taken by our brother Iraq regarding peace initiatives and continue to hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran  too  will find it possible to respond positively to the initiatives aimed at the cessation of the war. He are compelled to emphasize this in the interest of the stability of our region and of averting the dangers of foreign intervention  which could turn the region into an arena of conflict by the super-powers and foreign interests.In commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we welcome the scores of nations that have succeeded in gaining freedom and establishing their national entities in independent States where they manage their affairs in full freedom  in the interest of progress and the well-being of their peoples  and play their role in the international community through their membership as sovereign States of this organization.An exception to this is the Arab people of Palestine  who are living through a stage of persecution and displacement  resulting from the denial of their basic right to freedom and self-determination. This has been caused by the uprooting of the Palestinian people from their land  the usurpation of their country  attempts to suppress their national identity and the suspension of the human and cultural role enjoyed by it throughout its history.The question of Palestine  with its political  social and moral implications  continues to pose a challenge to the human conscience and to test the effectiveness of this Organization which created it. Any review of the developments and consequences of this question inevitably indicates the extent of their responsibility and arrogance that characterize the racist policy which has been adopted by Israel as a pattern for its acts of aggression against the Palestinian people and the Arab States. This is inspired by the colonial aims of the Zionist movement and its reliance on military night drawn from external sources. Everyone is wall aware of the role of some of the big Powers in supporting and consolidating Israeli occupation through the supply of economic  military and technological assistance  in addition to unequivocal political support by impeding the implementation of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and preventing the Security Council from adopting deterrent measures against the expansionist Israeli policies.The deteriorating situation in the Middle East is an inevitable and logical consequence of the failure of the international community to deal with the basic problem of putting an end to aggression and compelling the aggressor to cease its aggression.Events in our area have proved that separate settlements and partial solutions not only are incapable of laying sound foundations but contribute to aggravation and complication of the problem. Thus  ignoring the essence of the problem cannot  in our view  lead to the just and permanent solution to which we  with the other members of the international community  aspire. By this we mean recognition of the legitimate national right of the Palestinian people to regain self-determination and establish its Independent State in Palestine under the leadership cf its legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization  and through the implementation of General Assembly resolutions calling for the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations.With regard to other issues relating to the situation in the Middle East  the sister State of Lebanon continues to suffer from aggressive Israeli practices on its territory manifested through the occupation of a part of Lebanese territory  in clear violation of the principles of the charter  international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It is also manifested in fomenting conflicts among the Lebanese parties  while we pay a tribute to the Lebanese resistance for its heroic struggle against the Israeli occupation forces  we appeal to our brothers in Lebanon to settle their disputes and to endeavor to restore stability and sovereignty to Lebanon  we call upon the international community to assist Lebanon in overcoating its ordeal.The people of southern Africa are subjected to inhuman practices by the racist Pretoria regime  which has recently intensified its terrorist and discriminatory measures against the indigenous population in South Africa and occupied Namibia. The United Nations has adopted a number of resolutions condemning that racist regime and demanding an end to those measures  which violate the human rights of those people and deprive them of their freedom. However  those resolutions have gone unheeded  because of the failure of certain Member States to impose the sanctions provided for in them. This is an infringement of the principles of the Charter and encourages that regime to proceed with its persecution of the native population of southern Africa  in complete defiance of the international will. Those States should join in the international consensus by rejecting the racist practices of the Pretoria regime and complying with international resolutions.The declaration by Mr. Botha  the head of the racist regime  which unabashedly and arrogantly rejects all changes in the established policy of apartheid  supports our conviction that the only means to end this policy  which constitutes a crime against the rights and dignity of man  lies in the application of Chapter VII of the Charter against the racist regime. We reject the policy of leniency adopted by certain States since the so-called constructive engagement has failed completely to persuade that regime to change its policy.In condemning the heinous apartheid policy  the united Arab Emirates renews its support for the struggle of the people of southern Africa and the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's organization (SWAPO). it calls upon the international community to continue its aid to that valiant persecuted people to enable it to regain its usurped rights.The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations lends special and distinct importance to the question of disarmament  it is highly pertinent to refer to the first paragraph of the preamble of the Charter which calls for saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. However  the danger of war  in particular nuclear war  is growing day by day. We are hopeful that resumption of the negotiations between the two super-Powers will lead to the laying of the necessary grounds tor arms limitation and disarmament. The achievement of these two objectives and the resultant savings of enormous resources for economic and social development can be effected only in an atmosphere of political stability and mutual confidence  namely  by securing international peace and security. Events and experience have proved that peace cannot be attained through the stockpiling and development of arms.My country calls once once more for the establishment of nuclear-free zones  in particular in the Middle East. My country reaffirms its support for the United Nations resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace We look forward to the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean during the coming year in order to adopt measures necessary to implement the Declaration and to adhere to it  specifically by the big Powers.A commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and to United Nations resolutions which provide for the right of countries and peoples to self-determination and for respect for their wishes and non-interference in theirdomestic affairs is certain to reduce to a large extent the degree of current international tension and consequently to guarantee the security and stability of States  in particular the small and developing ones.This leads us to refer to the situation in Afghanistan  whose people are suffering from foreign interference and a conflict of alien interests. The united Arab Emirates calls upon all foreign forces to stop such interference and to withdraw foreign troops from Afghanistan's territory.This applies equally to the situation in Kampuchea  whose people have suffered from foreign interference. The same holds true for the problems in Central America. In this connection we support the formula proposed by the Contadora Group for settling the problems of the countries involved on a regional basis. For our part  we also urge the settlement of the existing dispute between North and South Korea through dialog between them  aimed at eliminating the causes for dispute and realization of their peoples' wishes for reunification.The Cyprus question presents one of the problems that calls for a continuation by the United Nations of its efforts to reach a final solution.In this connection we wish to express our appreciation of and support for the accomplishments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations In his efforts to find a solution to the Cyprus question by bringing closer the positions of the two parties to the conflict  which could lead to the conclusion of an early agreement regarding the necessary framework for a just and permanent settlement of the problem. This would guarantee for the island of Cyprus its independence  security  territorial integrity and non-alignment  as well as the legitimate rights of the two communities there.The issues of economic and social development are as important as the world's political problems. Despite the fact that much has been accomplished in the areasof economic development and technological progress  there are serious problems that the world continues to face.The experience of the past 40 years has proved that the basic problem  intrinsic to the nature of the existing economic order  lies in the fact that blind market forces deepen the inequity of opportunities and the unfairness of economic relationships which were originally unequal among the participants in that established order.Under the prevailing system  the tremendous progress in technological capabilities has led to increasing impediments to economic development instead of lessening its burden. The world development process  instead of leading to an increase in the growth rates and improvement in living standards  is presenting the developing countries with a frightening decline in their levels of growth and standards of living. Furthermore  the developing countries are confronted with mounting external debts  which have reached dangerous levels at a time when their terms of trade are worsening  their export earnings are decreasing and their national revenues are being eroded as a result of the increasing inflation and the fluctuating rates of exchange.Consequently the capacity of the developing countries to cope with the costs of development  whether economic  social or political  is declining rapidly while those costs are steadily increasing.This situation is occurring in an atmosphere of an increasing lack of confidence among the participants to the existing economic order and against a background of a marked decline in the spirit of co-operation and commitment  in particular on the part of the developed and industrialized countries  and also of attests to reduce the role of multilateral co-operation agencies.It is therefore necessary to emphasize that the solution or this problem requires a considerable effort and courage to face the principal and fundamental problems  the most important of which is to end the influence of the market forces on the international economic situation. This can be accomplished by providing an opportunity  seriously and sincerely  for the United Nations system and its various economic bodies to become the avenue for restoring confidence in the capability of international collective forces to reach successful solutions that would guarantee a future development for all peoples  and to save the human race from possible catastrophes that are likely to result from a continuation of the current economic order.During the past 40 years the United Nations has passed through several experiences ranging from success to failure. Whatever may be our views and positions  reality requires that we state that the United Nations continues to represent the hope and means of the future for saving the world from the scourge of a third world war  for laying the foundations of a world order and for establishing an effective and democratic framework for international participation in formulating resolutions relating to the standards of international conduct.The power of the United Nations lies in the commitment of its Members to adhere to the Charter  in the achievement of political harmony between East and West  and of economic harmony between North and South. The existence of the United Nations is dictated by the imperative of our survival and the need for continued interaction in this troubled world. Consequently we must endeavor to support the Organization and to enhance its position in order to realize our aspirations for a new world founded on peace and security  based on justice and equality and in which progress and prosperity can be realized."
"5",216,"ARG",40,1985,"First of all I should like to convey my congratulations to you. Sir  on your unanimous election as President of this fortieth session of the General Assembly. He are greatly encouraged to see our proceedings conducted by a diplomat of such deep knowledge  skill and tact  a son of Spain  a country with which Argentina is linked by the strongest historical ties of solidarity and fellowship.I should like also to extend my gratitude to Ambassador Paul Lusaka  who so effectively presided over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I cannot refrain today from expressing the profound grief of the people and the Government of Argentina over the tragedy that has afflicted the fraternal Mexican people. He offer them our sincere condolences and convey our feelings of solidarity. He have mounted an operation to give the Mexican Government all possible assistance and we hope that the difficult and tragic situation confronting it today will be swiftly remedied.The post-war international system  which includes as its center-piece the United Nations  is now 40 years old. Over such a long period of time our Organization has had time to find its place in the functioning of that system  and observers have had an opportunity to consolidate their views of the achievements and failures of the resulting system.It is an axiom that the United Nations from its beginning was not able to establish an efficient system of collective security. He also know the causes of this failure. The fact is that responsibility for the maintenance of global peace and for the territorial integrity or political independence of the smaller nations does not lie solely with our Organization. But even with regard to the objective of peace - and indeed the other objectives of the United Nations  in particular international co-operation - it is worth restating the oft-repeated observation that everything would be much worse today if the Organization did not exist and that  undoubtedly  if it had not been founded in 1945 it would have had to be founded today.It is worth stating that  40 years after the founding of the United Nations  the picture is one of great achievements and - why hide the fact? - deep disappointments.Among the most positive achievements of the day  we must  undoubtedly  include the process of decolonization  in which the United Nations played a leading role. The important impact of our Organization on that process was due-to the fact that it provided for the colonial countries and peoples the forum of the General Assembly  where they could create an awareness of the inherent evils of colonialism and the injustice of the situation of which they were victims.As a result of the process of decolonization  we have almost fully achieved the ideal of universality in the membership of the United Nations. It is to be hoped that this universality will become complete. That principle has always been fostered by Argentina  since the time of the League of Nations itself  and it was precisely out of loyalty to that principle that our country temporarily withdrew from that body in 1920.But this great achievement of our Organization is tarnished by the persistence of colonial situations in various parts of the world. Namibia continues to be a tragic victim of an anachronistic system aggravated by the inhuman practice of apartheid. Other peoples and territories are still suffering under the colonial yoke.We must also fight against new forms of colonialism that have arisen from the vast inequality that continues to exist between the technologically advanced and the developing countries. This new kind of dependence  aggravated with every passing day by the widening of the technological gulf  is reaching dangerous extremes. An increasingly important element in international co-operation within the framework of the United Nations is everything relating to the transfer of technology  so our Organization can assist the efforts of developing countries to achieve more satisfactory levels of efficiency.In the field of human rights considerable progress has been made as a result of collective action. Apart from regional agreements  including the inter-American agreement signed by Argentina recently  action by the United Nations has succeeded in reducing the number and magnitude of violations of human rights in a number of parts of the world  and it is clear that international public opinion is turning against governments that engage in such violations. In so far as concerns my own country  the intervention of international organizations contributed decisively to the easing of the situations of numerous victims of political persecution and helped save others from a grim fate during a recent dramatic period of our history.Nevertheless there is still a great deal of ground to be covered. The practice of apartheid in South Africa is an outrage in our century. Torture  imprisonment and political persecution in all its forms are in many parts of our planet deplorable daily realities.Disarmament has received particularly great attention from our Organization. My country has done a great deal to that end in United Nations disarmament organs  in accordance with an ancient national tradition favoring the rule of law in international relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes between States. The establishment in Argentina of a democratic regime has meant a genuine return to those traditions  of which we are so proud. Accordingly the national Government has bent every effort in its attempts to help curb the arms race and to continue with the development of exclusively peaceful uses of nuclear energy.Because of this concern  our President  together with the Heads of State or Government of the countries of a number of continents  took part in a series of concerted efforts  culminating in the New Delhi Declaration  in which we expressed the intention to heed the demand voiced by millions who expect their leaders to represent them in their concerns and anxieties in the face of the vast capacity for destruction of existing nuclear arsenals.Since that time my country has attempted to remain true to the content of that message. On every possible occasion we have highlighted the importance of keeping public opinion informed and alive to the threats it faces as a way of influencing the political will of those who bear primary responsibility for the production of effective disarmament agreements.In order to take action at the national level in keeping with international obligations  Argentina has substantially reduced its military expenditures. In particular we have reaffirmed our determination - which is repeatedly proclaimed -to use nuclear technology exclusively for peaceful purposes. In a recent message to the disarmament Conference  President Alfonson stated that:""with regard to the nuclear question  my country will be a civilian nuclear State. This was supported when the Argentine people approved  in the course of national elections  a program supporting the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes.""Almost 25 years ago  to avoid the consequences of the bi-polarization of the world  the Non-Aligned Movement was founded in Belgrade. I should like to mark its relevance to this fortieth anniversary of the united Nations  because in fact the principal arena for the activities of that movement is none other than our world Organization because we understand that its original principles  in so far as they are respected and enforced  make it an important force for moderation between the positions of the two military major alliances. But they should always be guided precisely by true principles of non-alignment: equi-distance between the blocs  non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the juridical equality of States  and rejection of all forms of domination.My country is going through a difficult hut exciting stage of its history marked by the Argentine people's recovery of its rights and freedoms within the democratic system of life and government necessitated by our evolution as a nation and our characteristics as a society. The Government I represent emanates from the genuine will of the Argentinians and is leading the reconstruction of the country  and its foreign policy reflects the same values that guide its internal policy. Argentinians have made sacrifices to ensure peace  the right to self-determination  the dignity of man  the right to life  the rational and peaceful settlement of disputes. These are the specific needs of every Argentinian and the lasting aims of our nation.But history has shown that not only efforts and the passage of time produce the true consolidation of political independence. One hundred and fifty years before our Asian and African brothers  we in Latin America formally achieved our liberty. Nevertheless  like them  we remain subject to many different forms of dependence which limit our political capacity to decide on our own destiny.It is not just a matter of material or economic conditions. The Latin American experience has shown how much we are affected by the confrontation between the major Powers  which even limits our capacity to control our own affairs. In Latin America  many phenomena destructive of the political system cannot adequately be explained by domestic causes  nor by flaws inherent in our political systems. In fact  those internal weaknesses are exacerbated because of external influences and the conflict between the super-Powers.Latin America is now affected in one way or another by the grave situation in Central America. The constant incidents in the frontier region between Nicaragua and Costa Rica have brought about a serious worsening of relations between those two countries  creating such serious tension as to result in a marked decline in efforts to create the necessary atmosphere of trust between the States involved in the conflict  the essential prerequisite for achieving a comprehensive agreement to put an end to the crisis.We should be aware of the risk involved in postponing a balanced and realistic solution to the points of disagreement. The Argentine Republic believes that positions based on intolerance will only lessen the possibility of bringing about an agreement that is just and honor able for all the parties in the conflict; they will  on the other hand  encourage the use of military options.The Foreign Ministers of the member countries of the Contadora Group met on 24 and 25 August in Cartagena  where they were joined by the Foreign Ministers of Brazil  Peru  Uruguay and Argentina  countries which have constituted a support group  whose objectives are to support and give effect to the peace-making activities of the Contadora Group. We are absolutely convinced of the importance of that initiative  which reflects the political will and capacity for concerted action of Latin America to achieve  from its own standpoint  a negotiated and lasting solution to the Central American conflict.I should like to repeat my Government's concern over the situation in the Middle East and to endorse the statements made on that serious matter by the Argentine Democratic Government  particularly with regard to the extent to which it is possible to find a just and lasting solution if  on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  the following conditions can be effectively met: first  respect for the right to existence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the countries of the region; secondly  the eight of all countries of the region to secure  internationally recognized frontiers; and  thirdly  the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories.The Palestinian question is another cause of great concern to my Government. We again repast that it cannot be resolved properly and equitably without support for the actions and initiatives originating at the United Nations  based on international law and the Charter of our Organization. The essential objective of those actions and initiatives is that the Palestinian people should be able to exercise its inalienable right to self-determination and independence  the establishment of its own national State and its own legitimate representation in the negotiations that must be begun to that end.My Government is also following with growing concern the development of events in Africa  and has given practical effect to its rejection of the policies of racial discrimination  aggression and domination which have been imposed upon the peoples of southern Africa.The need for a rapid and just solution to that grave conflict is perhaps the most urgent and real challenge facing the United Nations today. It is a challenge that has already existed for 40 years  and its continuation damages the credibility and efficiency of our Organization. For four decades now South Africa has violated with impunity fundamental principles and concrete provisions of the Charter  obstinately refusing to eradicate apartheid totally and for ever  persisting in its illegal occupation of Namibia and carrying out repeated acts of aggression against neighboring States. The grave events that have been occurring daily in South Africa confirm that the policies of Pretoria are a threat to peace and security in the region. An appropriate reaction to that behavior is essential not only to put an end to racism and South African expansionism  but also to preserve the political and social order represented by our Organization.Argentina repeats its strong condemnation and repudiation of apartheid and its unswerving support for the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence in a united Namibia. Together with the vast majority of the international community  we believe that the time has come for the United Nations to adopt  through the Security Council  urgent and effective measures to increase the effective pressure on Pretoria.For our part  during the past year we have taken concrete steps against South Africa in the diplomatic  economic  cultural and sporting fields. Most recently  the Congress of my country ratified the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. As long as apartheid and the illegal occupation of Namibia continue. South Africa can only expect our support to grow for the legitimate struggle of the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia to establish free  democratic and egalitarian societies in southern Africa.My Government once again denounces the continuation of the illegal occupation of part of Argentine territory by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In spite of the repeated appeals of the international community to the parties to find a just  peaceful and final solution to the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas Islands  the united Kingdom continues to refuse to engage in serious and comprehensive negotiations  in its attempt to consolidate an anachronistic colonial situation. In systematically opposing the implementation of specific United Nations resolutions on the question of the Malvinas Islands  it is also opposing the whole policy followed by the international Organization to put an end to colonialism in the world.The Argentine Democratic Government has on many occasions expressed its firm determination to solve the controversy by peaceful means. It has therefore made concrete offers for the resumption of negotiations  but so far there has been no positive response.Furthermore  the British Government has made public its refusal to include in any negotiations the subject of sovereignty  which is the very source of the dispute and to which are linked all the other questions affecting relations between the two countries.In addition to that intransigence  a factor worsening the situation is the excessive British military presence in the south Atlantic. That militarization not only poses a threat to Argentine territory  but affects the whole region  as was recently established by the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States.The construction of a strategic airport in the islands and the extraordinary naval build-up jeopardize the stability of an area that forms part of the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone. No one can deny today that those British actions have transformed the Malvinas Islands into an area of strategic interest  drawing in the global conflict between East and West.Without prejudice to what I have just said  as a clear demonstration of my Government's desire for peace and its negotiating spirit  a little over two months ago we once again proposed to the British Government the start of conversations  in response to the lifting of the commercial restrictions unilaterally imposed by the United Kingdom in 1982.The fact is that for us relations between the two Governments and countries can be developed on a solid basis only to the extent that the central problem between us - the sovereignty dispute over the islands - is not ignored. To ignore that subject would be to base any restoration of relations on a fiction.Furthermore  the Argentine Government  which does not consider it necessary to make a formal declaration of the cessation of Hostilities  sines there was Raver a declaration of war  and the cessation has been recognized in a number of resolutions of the United Nations  nevertheless declared  on 10 July this years""if this matter"" -a formal declaration of cessation of hostilities -is viewed by the united Kingdom Government as the remaining obstacle to the initiation of negotiations  the Argentine Government would be prepared to make the declaration as soon as the united Kingdom Government agrees to initiate the general negotiations repeatedly recommended by the international community."" (A/40/478  p. 3)In the circumstances  I should like to repeat here  in this hall  our invitation to the Government of the United Kingdom to resume negotiations to find a solution to the sovereignty dispute between our two nations  a dispute which is obstructing the normalization of our relations.In this connection  and as clear evidence that we have no conflict with the country but with the Government  just a few days ago in Paris President Alfonsin met with the leader of the Labor Party and the Parliamentary opposition in the United Kingdom  the Right Honorable Neil Kinnock  HP  and they both agreed:""... on the need for the re-establishment of diplomatic and commercial relations between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom. To that end  they expressed their desire that negotiations should be initiated to explore the means of resolving the outstanding problems between the two countries  including all aspects of the future of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).""They also jointly stressed the importance for the inhabitants of those islands of effectively guaranteeing the preservation of their customs  their ways of life and traditions  as well as respect for forms of administration  education and social and economic organization. In that connection  Mr. Kinnock stressed the fundamental importance of taking fully into account the interests of the inhabitants of the islands  and President Alfonsin pointed to the range and the extent of the rights guaranteed by Argentina's democratic constitution."" (A/40/662  p. 3)That is the position of the Argentine Government with regard to a question which calls for a prompt and final solution. For that to happen we need a substantial gesture on the part of the Government of the United Kingdom which would demonstrate a genuine wish to put an end to the controversy.The crisis which has been affecting the economy of the developing countries has grown worse. This situation is fraught with the most serious consequences  particularly for the peoples of our countries because the right to peace is indissolubly linked to the right to development.We have been vigorously advocating a total restructuring of the international economic relations  a structure governed by equality and justice. Nevertheless  only a few countries in the North understand that sustained social and economic progress of the South would be of benefit to them. In contrast  there are many countries which maintain an attitude of historical short-sightedness which is reflected in the persistence of protectionist policies  in the substantial reduction of the flow of capital for financing development and an increasing deterioration in the terms of trade. Therefore  we repeat that we are not looking for charity  but for the concrete will to find solutions which would be to our mutual advantage and which could put an end to this world recession.The situation is particularly serious in some countries represented here because they have suffered from extremely severe climatic conditions which have caused hunger and disease. In other countries  difficulties have been compounded by payment obligations deriving from an external debt that was contracted in a chaotic international market and at real interest rates which have been the highest in history.In Latin America  together with the Central American crisis  the other major question of concern to our region is precisely that of the external debt of the countries of our region. Of course  this is a subject which affects almost the whole developing world  but the form it has assumed in Latin America has probably hit that region harder than other regions. Indeed  a large proportion of our external debt is connected with floating rates of interest. In practice  this has meant for my country  for example  that over the last four years the external debt has increased by 50 per cent as a result of changes in the rates of interest which  as is only too clear  are entirely outside our control and independent of our will.In recent years our region has seen exceptional political change. Almost all our countries have put authoritarian regimes behind them and  after a prolonged struggle for freedom and dignity  democracy is now flourishing in our part of the Americas. But if this experience of ours shows that the people are mobilizing in the name of liberty to achieve democracy  history teaches us that they are also mobilizing in the name of well being to maintain democracy. In other words  growth is directly linked with the stability of this hard won democracy. The truth is that this growth is seriously jeopardized by our capacity to generate resources. This is particularly .true if a large proportion of those resources are swallowed up precisely by payment of the interest on the debt.Our countries are now being asked to put into effect internal adjustment programs  which are frequently necessary for the proper organization of our economies. But those programs  which call for austerity and effort  to be successful also require prospects of growth  and hence well being. It is the expectation of growth which makes sense of the current efforts. Therefore it is impossible to conceive of a stable situation in which austerity would not be accompanied by growth  or at least by the hope of growth. Thus  the question of resources for development is something today which has a clear cut political corollary  because the ultimate stabilization of our democracy would depend on our obtaining those resources. In the circumstances  the problem of external debt becomes an eminently practical and political problem  and by that I mean to say that although it is vital to continue the debate with regard to the need for a new world economic order  keeping alive our demand for international justice  no one can reasonably suppose that we shall achieve immediate results from sum a debate. However  our countries need urgent solutions which  while supporting our general demands  will make it possible to solve the specific and very serious blockages which exist today to our growth. In other words  there is a time for global debate and a time for exploring immediate measures. We think those two approaches are not contradictory and that  furthermore  they are actually complementary. But what does seem a problem to us is the fact that general discussion prevents us from making progress in the search for solutions which would make it possible to retrieve a proportion of the resources which today are earmarked for the payment find external debt servicing. It is vital  therefore  that the industrial countries should also shoulder some responsibility and undertake to eliminate the disruptive factors which have caused the present crisis of indebtedness. This was the sense of the appeal issued by the 11 Latin American countries which subscribed to the Cartagena consensus of June 1984.The General Assembly has decided to adopt on its agenda of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations an item entitled ""The United Nations for a better world"". Therefore  we should ask ourselves on this occasion what is this better world to which we aspire and how would we like to see it brought about.We are convinced that the peoples of the world aspire to a future of peace which would mean more than the absence of war and conflict. What they want above all is a situation which would make it possible for them to enjoy the fruits and benefits of peace  which is to be understood as a condition for the attainment and affirmation of the rights of the individual. Without the guarantee of those rights  efforts to improve standards of living would be incomplete and limited. We therefore believe that commitment to an ethical system free from strategic concepts should be the source of concerted political action. The better world to which we all aspire depends internally  upon the building of democratic societies  the rule of law and tolerance. Hence  we should like to see a just and stable international order without the distortions of power politics and without the imbalances generated by a purely financial view of economic interaction.The better world we see is based on three fundamental principles of civilized coexistence: juridical equality of States  non-intervention in internal affairs and the self-determination of peoples.The better world we all hope for requires a new consensus for development which would make possible mutual benefit from trade and promote the well-being of the peoples.The ways and means of achieving this better world remain today  as they were 40 years ago  the elimination of the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race; recognition of the right to independence of peoples under colonial domination and foreign occupation and the right to territorial integrity and social and economic development; and the peaceful solution of disputes between States by means of dialog and negotiation.These are the principles of the Charter  whose fortieth anniversary we are celebrating.We understand the difficulties in achieving the objectives of the Charter and we are not unaware of the fact that we have not been able to succeed in this over the last 40 years  but we are mindful of the invaluable contribution of the united Nations to the cause of peace  decolonization and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.The political determination of the Argentine Government to help ensure that this contribution is greater and more profound  to the benefit of all  constitutes one of the reasons for our firm commitment to the United Nations. The other  even more important reason is our commitment to the value system based on the Charter  without which it would not be possible to ensure a future of dignity for all the peoples of the international community."
"6",321,"AUS",40,1985,"I extend my congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of this fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your long service in this body and your extensive diplomatic experience will stand us all in good stead. I would also like to express our sincere congratulations to your predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka of Zambia  on his exemplary work throughout the thirty-ninth session.I would additionally like to express the profound concern and sympathy of the Australian Government and the Australian people to the Government of the Republic of Mexico on the great national and personal tragedy which has beset Mexico City. We trust that the indefatigable energies of the Mexican people and their Government and the commitment and understanding of the rest of the world allow Mexico to rebuild and progress with confidence.There were plenty of people in 1945  and especially in the dark days in the five or six years following  who would ever have believed that we would survive to celebrate the fortieth birthday of this Organization. Even if only for that fact  we should not begrudge the tone of relief and congratulation in the statements made in this Assembly this year. Over the past 40 years significant progress has been made towards putting into concrete form the decisions of 1945: that we were indeed a global community  that no place could any longer be insulated against the currents of change let loose by a second world war  that in a novel world of independent sovereign nations a coherent system of international authority and solidarity was needed.This being a special occasion  I intend the Australian statement to be not the usual survey of world developments but more an examination of the condition in which the United Nations finds itself after 40 years.The development of the United Nations has led us to accept a code of international behavior. Great and successful work has been carried out on codifying international laws on matters such as sovereignty over the sea and the sea-bed which used to be a cause of war. The process of post-War decolonization  which could have been so painful in so many areas  has been eased and enabled. I might say in parenthesis that Australia regrets that the decolonization process in New Caledonia has not gone ahead at the pace which the world community might have expected. We regret it particularly because of the unsettling effect it is having on our region.Humanity everywhere has benefited from such developments as the recognition that human rights are the rightful concern of the world community. Collective effort has brought about economic and social advance for millions of people who would otherwise have remained mere objects of historical accident or coincidence. It is all but impossible to put a value on the outcome of the activities born inthis collective spirit: the literacy program of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization; the United Nations Children's Fund; the United Nations Development Program; the Food and Agriculture organization; the World Food Program and other forms of material assistance; the lives saved by the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; the social profit from such programs as the recent women's Conference in Nairobi; and the International Years of the disabled  of youth and of peace.For the past 40 years no world war has broken out  though we have been close at times  and an important factor in this success has been the authority and sense of community which has been won by this Organization. I make this last point in the list of blessings which the United Nations has helped bestow on the international community not because it is a cause for congratulations between us here but because it is also a matter which should cause us to think carefully about what we mean by such concepts as peace and progress and community independence. It is a matter which should cause us to reflect on whether or not we can make this Organization serve these concepts more effectively and justly  especially in the context of peace and freedom.In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General refers to a remark by the late President Franklin Roosevelt which was a guiding signal to the Australian Government at the time. The United Nations  the President said ""spells - and it ought to spell - the end of the system of unilateral action  exclusive alliances  and spheres of influence  and balances of power  and all the other expedients which have been tried for centuries and have always failed"". (A/40/1  p. 2) If that standard is applied to this Organization  it has to be said that we still have a lot to do.Let me emphasize a point about our record of there having been no world wars for 40 years. There are people on every continent who would disagree strongly. There are people on every continent who would hold that when we talk about the absence of world war we have a very limited world in mind. There are people on every continent whose world would have been shattered or even destroyed by events that many of us here would call little local difficulties. These people discern from the international structures that we have created  such as the United Nations  that our world is a place in which political  economic and military power is restricted. They observe the great paradox of the United Nations  that  as the international community of independent States has grown  power in it has been given into fewer hands.The Secretary-General has drawn out attention to an example of this: the impact on many countries of indebtedness and methods of debt-servicing - a complex and sensitive issue. If the rich could hire other people to die for them  as the old saying goes  the poor could make a wonderful living. Measures such as adjustment programs and debt rescheduling are important elements of a strategy which may be successful. I say ""may be"" because we cannot yet assume that the problem is solved. Moreover  we have to be careful that the cure will not kill the patient. We have to take care that  while adjustment measures may restore credit-worthiness and stability to debtor countries  they do not undermine the often fragile democracy existing in those countries. And those debtor countries which are going through the adjustment process have every right to expect support from the international community  in policies leading to reasonable exchange rates  for example  in credible exchange rates and in better access to the markets of industrialized countries.This is an example not only of the concentration of power but also of concentrated power being exercised outside the influence of this Organization. This process began  in fact  when the founding nations gathered to organize the United Nations. In Australia we noted that the topic of discussion was not paths to peace so much as the distribution of power  who should have it  who could share it. This was the grain of sand that was put into the machinery of world government. The machinery works; there is no argument about that: As I have said  it provides world order  world authority and the foundation of a true world community. But the machinery could work better for those who were not present at the power-sharing ceremonies 40 years ago.At the United Nations we weave complex webs of theology and rhetoric about such developments as apartheid  for example  or disarmament. We have learned to live with these problems. Some of us employ experts who spend their entire careers working at them. Somehow  the problems remain and even grow. This is in spite of the fact that they create concern and sometimes even terror among many people who rely on us for representation. The Australian Government contends that at this fortieth session of the General Assembly we should start the process by which the Organization will become more effective in dealing with such problems for the greater good. I have deliberately nominated apartheid and disarmament because of both their potential for disaster and the better capacity of the United Nations to deal with them.I do not intend to dwell on the evil nature of apartheid  which is obvious to all here. It is a moral abomination. The South African Government has carried out some cosmetic pruning of it  but its trunk  its main branches and its roots remain  in the main  untouched. The question is  will its inevitable downfall be even more violent than what we have already witnessed or can we help remove it relatively peacefully? Each day of bloodshed in South Africa makes the prospectof moderation more remote. The Australian Government still maintains  however  that it should try peaceful pressure while it can to persuade the South African Government to abandon a barbaric system which is inevitably heading for massive violence and join a world which has more civilized standards.Australia has suspended new official investment in South Africa and has prohibited South African Government investment in Australia. Australian banks and other financial institutions have been asked to suspend new loans to borrowers in South Africa. We have taken steps to withdraw our Trade Commissioner from South Africa and to withdraw Government assistance to Australians trading with South Africa. Australia will no longer export to South Africa petroleum products  computers and equipment known to be of use to South African security forces. We have prohibited the import of krugerrands  all other coins minted in South Africa and military supplies  we have introduced a code of conduct for Australian companies operating in South Africa which ensures that they do not profit from the use of racist labor laws and practices. We are preparing a strategy for the meeting next month of the Commonwealth Heads of Government to continue this policy. We have in mind setting up a group of international authorities to work out proposals for peaceful transition in South Africa as well as a group which will study ways in which new investment in South Africa can be suspended.The Australian Government  furthermore  is working in this Organization for a worldwide  mandatory system of economic sanctions. We appreciate the concern that some governments have that sanctions will hurt black South Africans. They should note  however  that black South Africans themselves are calling for such sanctions  even though they could be put to death for doing so. The South Africans who will suffer most from sanctions will be the privileged white elite who are benefiting most from the apartheid system. Recent overtures by white businessmen to black leaders indicate that business has a clearer vision of reality than the zealots in the South African Government. Australia believes that it is especially important that those countries who are major investors in South Africa should take up an active role in the campaign for sanctions for which Australia will be working.The case of Namibia is a closely-related problem. As a member of the Council for Namibia and a nation with a close interest in decolonization  Australia is especially concerned at South Africa's flagrant defiance of the United Nations in this matter. The United Nations terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia nearly 20 years ago. It established the Council as the legal Administering Authority. United Nations resolutions set out a simple and workable plan for the handover of Namibia to its people through free elections. The South African Government's refusal to do this has led to South Africa's forces rampaging in their neighbors' territory and murdering their neighbors' citizens. We condemn South Africa's behavior in this matter  which adds another reason for the Security Council imposing mandatory economic sanctions on a government which is rapidly running out of friends.Nuclear disarmament is an example of an issue on which significant advance has been achieved; but not so significant as to dispel the fear that many people have about it. By progress  I mean such fundamentally important arrangements as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the SALT I and II agreements. I have especially in mind the non-proliferation Treaty where the Review Conference ended its deliberations only 10 days ago. The non-proliferation Treaty has made an extraordinary contribution to stability in the nuclear age  providing security for all of us - signatories or not. The Review Conference itself was an encouraging example of international co-operation. Treaty partners reaffirmed its validity and strength. But they also argued that it needs to be more effectively implemented in such key areas as the development of the safeguards regime. They drew attention to the urgent need for article VI of the Treaty to be fully implemented and to the particular responsibilities of the nuclear-weapon States. The agreement on a treaty for a South Pacific nuclear-free zone  reached by member States of the South Pacific forum last month  was welcomed at the conference. Nuclear-weapon States are invited to adhere to the relevant protocols of this Treaty. Of course  I repeat the invitation today. The Antarctic is exempted from the international arms race by specific provisions against its militarization. As an Antarctic Treaty party we applaud this and the general manner in which the Antarctic is managed.So progress has been made on this potentially most destructive problem facing us  But it must also be said that the progress has been slow  often limited and often grudging. The Australian Government says this  not as a bystander wringing its hands  but as an active and sometimes frustrated participant in the disarmament process. We have a right to express this frustration. We understand that the major and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war rests with the nuclear-weapon States  and particularly the super-Powers. In this sense  disarmament suffers from the same irony that afflicts the united Nations as a whole: though the effects of nuclear war would be felt by all  direct power to prevent it is restricted to a few. The few should reflect on this. Probably as many as 30 States  including Australia  have considered acquiring nuclear weapons at one time or other because of the security and status they were thought to provide. Those countries have decided not to do so because they accept the norm laid down in the non-proliferation Treaty that nuclear weapons are simply not acceptable in the progressive world order. In making this decision  those States earned the right to influence the disarmament process  rather than leave it to an exclusive coterie of nuclear Powers. They have earned the right to point out aspects of the process which give them cause for concern.We in Australia  of course  appreciate the complexities of the process. Our view is that the foremost goal of disarmament negotiations is early and radical reductions in the number of nuclear weapons. If negotiations focus on this and if they take fair account of the valid interest of each party in the maintenance of stability  it should not be all that difficult to identify the numbers and types of weapon systems which could be reduced. Difficulties would arise if the negotiations are not conducted in the fair way I have just described. They would also arise if agreement on reductions is made conditional on other issues. We would be deeply concerned  for instance  if linkage with other  perhaps related  but clearly separate matters held up movement towards reduction of weapons.Another of our concerns is the possibility of an arms race in space. The Australian Government has declined to endorse the United States strategic defense initiative. We prefer that maximum attention be given to eliminating existing weapons systems  preserving the anti-ballistic missile regime and enhancing international efforts to ensure that activities in space remain exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is necessary to speak plainly in a situation in which there is inadequate clarity about the facts. There should be no weapons system in space  in our view. If there are such systems  and if those who propose the exclusively peaceful use of space have such systems already there  they should remove them. If there is an honest difference in interpreting what constitutes permissible research under the anti-ballistic missile Treaty  those who want to preserve the anti-ballistic missile regime should be able to work the differences out.The Soviet Union has proposed to the Assembly that we should take a new step towards international co-operation in space. The Australian Government will study the proposal carefully and critically  bearing in mind all the ramifications of the extensive research on this matter which has already been conducted over many years by the Soviet Union.Our most immediate concern on arms control and disarmament is the failure to agree on a treaty which would prohibit all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time. Such a comprehensive ban is essential to an end to an arms race. This is why it has been sought for the best part of 25 years. This is why commitments to negotiate such a treaty have been made in so many existing international agreements  including the non-proliferation Treaty. And this is why progress towards such a treaty has been so frustratingly slow. The concluding document of the non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference called on the nuclear-weapon states to resume negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as a matter of urgency and before the end of this year. I propose to take up this call at the Assembly  I direct it particularly at those members of the Conference on Disarmament who have withheld consensus on proposals which Australia  New Zealand and others have made so that practical work can be started without delay on the comprehensive test-ban treaty. Procedural wrangling about how that work should be described does a terrible disservice to the community that we represent here.We all know that there are differences of view on the issues of scope  verification and compliance in such a comprehensive test-ban arrangement. But the only way these differences will be resolved is for us to sit down together and work on them. As the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference proposes  this should be done without more delay. If delay continues  the Australian Government intends to search for an alternative means of settling the problems of scope  verification and compliance. In other words  if there are nuclear-weapon States that have problems with the details of scope  verification and compliance  we intend to work with like-minded non-nuclear-weapon States to establish a working alternative.Before I leave the disarmament issue  I wish to record the Australian Government's appreciation of the decision by the Government of China  earlier this year  that it would participate in work on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as soon as it is able to be started in the Committee on Disarmament. One nuclear-weapon State  France  chooses by contrast to take no part in discussing the test-ban issue. Moreover  it continues to conduct tests in the Pacific  far from metropolitan France  in what is now within the area of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. It continues to do so over the vehement and consistent protest of the nations in the area. Australia takes no pleasure in disputes with France. But France insists on provoking dispute through its testing policy and activities in the region  which President Mitterrand himself has admitted are an absurd crime and sabotage. This makes us all the more bitter to be told by France that it will not conduct these so-called harmless nuclear tests in France  rather than where we and our friends live. That is why we resent so much acts of so described sabotage on the territory of a nation which considered France to be its friend.Disarmament and the problems of southern Africa are but two of the major issues before the world community which have caused speculation about the capacity of the international system to resolve long-standing issues on its agenda. I have in mind those problems which threaten international or regional security  such as the tragic turmoil in Lebanon and the continuing occupation of Afghanistan  which we continue to condemn. I repeat Australia's condemnation of Viet Nam's continuing occupation of Cambodia  though we are encouraged by recent signs of progress towards political settlement brought about by the good offices of our friends Indonesia and Malaysia. We have also been heartened by some signs of forward movement towards a comprehensive settlement in the Middle Bast. Despite the deplorable Israeli violation of the sovereignty of Tunisia  we still hope that all sides will work towards early and substantive negotiations. In these and other cases  the ability of this Organization to effect solutions has been limited in various ways. The veto has been used in the Security Council  not in the dispassionate  tutelary manner envisaged 40 years ago  but more to protect the interests of the veto Powers. Threats to the international system come from the effects of underdevelopment and trade inequity  as well as from war. But the Security Council  despite its peace-keeping obligations  shares little if any of the power wielded on these issues through such bodies as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The question arises: Should wider potentially destabilizing issues  as well as military threats  be considered by the Security Council?Hundreds of thousands of people are being destroyed by the war between Iraq and Iran. Twenty-five Members of this Organization - some of them with great influence - sell arms to one or other of the combatants. Nine Member nations sell arms to both. Should United Nations Members be allowed without penalty to turn the Iraq-Iran war into a gigantic arms bazaar as well as a channel house? Practical answers to these terrible problems are available and they can be forged by this Organization. It is my Government's hope that the Security Council will be able  impartially  to assist both countries in moving towards a resolution of this terrible conflict.The record of the United Nations in easing the decolonization process is an immutable one  as I have pointed out. But colonization survives and even in its last moments it causes pain and tension. We see something of this especially in the Pacific region. The question perhaps might be ashed: Should decolonization  its pace and its extent  be left to the colonizing Power or should it be a matter for involvement by this Organization?Prevention of nuclear war is the most immediately pressing task facing us today. This demands nuclear disarmament. Negotiations on the issue are proceeding in Geneva  and we are all grateful for that. It has to be appreciated that the minutiae of arms control arrangements can practically be dealt with only by those immediately involved. But the ramifications of arms control arrangements  or lack of such arrangements  flow beyond the borders and responsibilities of those immediately involved. Is there a case for the proposal by my colleague from Burkina Faso for the Security Council  the world's paramount peace-keeping organization  to meet especially to discuss peace and disarmament in the context of world economic and social development? Should the Council be reformed to reflect more accurately the world as it is today? The United Nations and its institutions have contributed to peace and progress on a scale and in ways that almost defy valuation. Could it do even better without structures which may be found  after careful evaluation  to be perhaps imperfect or outdated?These questions  of course  have been heard before. They are heard more often as the United Nations advances into respectable maturity. They were raised at the Security Council last week  where a degree of consensus evolved in favor of the need for greater commitment and efficiency. Australia raises them here in an attempt to get the issues that they raise examined while we are of a mind to reflect on our achievements and our failures. We raise these questions in a spirit of active and profound loyalty to the United Nations and its ideals.Australia is one of the founding and original Members of the United Nations. We are a member of the Security Council. We have provided moral  physical and financial support for a vast range of United Nations activities: from control over narcotics  keeping the peace  improving the status of women and the health of children to the survival of refugees. In all these activities  the Australian Government has had the benefit of the great goodwill of the Australian people. We appreciate the complications of the system. We understand the drawbacks of the political process. We know that nations cannot be expected to ignore genuine national interests. But we also realize that the United Nations will get nowhere if we are not also fueled by the idealism which created such concepts as the World Health Organization (WHO)  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the United Nations Development Program and the Conference on Disarmament. We should therefore take our fortieth anniversary as an opportunity to renew this idealism  committed to ensuring that the operations and structure of the United Nations are not vehicles for our own shortcomings or ambitions  but are relevant to a world whose complexity and needs could not have been even imagined 40 years ago."
"7",368,"AUT",40,1985,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Austria entertains cordial relations and has developed close co-operation with your country. Your wide experience in the United Nations specially qualifies you to guide this Assembly in its deliberations. Please accept our best wishes for the acconfJlishraent of the difficult task that lies ahead of you.May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Paul Lusaka  who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly. His visits to Austria during his tenure were highly appreciated.I should like also to express our sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General of our Organization for his efforts to promote peace and co-operation and to improve the image and enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations.At the outset  on behalf of the Austrian Government  I wish to convey our profound and deeply-felt condolences to the people and Government of Mexico. ' We share their sorrow at the untold suffering and loss of human life. Austria will contribute to the best of its abilities to helping the victims of the earthquakes.Uncertainty about the future and fear overshadow the lives of people all over the world. Their fear is not irrational. Existing nuclear arsenals are sufficient to kill mankind many times over. We are tired of the argument that lasting security can be ensured only through the build-up of military power. Multiple crises and armed conflicts in the world continue. While the fear of the atomic bomb prevails  we must not forget that conventional wars have killed millions of people since the end of the Second World War.Pessimism and resignation must not doom our efforts  we do not hold office to lament the state of the world; it is our task to better it. It may sound like a cliche but it is still a truth: Governments are there to implement the will of the people. And the people of our countries want peace. Peace can be secured  and progress can be achieved. What we share as fellow human beings is such more important than what divides us. The present situation calls for a thoroughgoing change of attitude. Policy has to reassert its primacy over technology. Not competition in military power at co-operation is the key to real security.It is my firm conviction that substantial arms-control and disarmament agreements can be achieved. Having listened to the speech of the Foreign Ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union  this belief is strengthened. The forthcoming meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev offers a unique chance to break the deadlock and prepare the ground for significant disarmament measures. I appeal to both sides to exert every effort to overcome their differences and to take the first steps towards a more peaceful world.Weapons do not cause wars  and arms control and are reduction alone cannot guarantee peace. Peace is not a technical process of counting weapons; peace has to be built upon confidence between peoples  confidence in the good will and the peaceful aims of the other side.In Europe the Stockholm Conference  within the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  has added this important dimension to the process of detente. The mandate for the Stockholm Conference centers on measures to strengthen confidence between East and West. We now expect the participants in that Conference to enter into concrete negotiations.By adopting the Final Act 10 years ago the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe created a comprehensive framework of co-operation for the entire European continent. They opened up opportunities for co-operation in the fields of security and human rights  in the areas of trade  science  culture  human contacts and information. Building a more constructive relationship between Bast and West demands permanent efforts. Austria remains firmly committed to the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. There is no better way to reduce tensions and strengthen the stability in Europe which is so essential for world peace. We look forward with hope and confidence to the follow-up conference in Vienna in 1986.One of the main global issues today - and many previous speakers have touched on this subject - is the economic crisis in the third world. People in developing countries must be freed from poverty  hunger and disease. They must have a fair and equal chance to develop their strength and abilities. We urgently need a vigorous new beginning in the dialog between North and South in order to build a more equitable and just international economic order. Above all  we need the political will to address the world's most pressing economic and social problems.The debt crisis has already taken a heavy toll. Dozens of third-world . countries have lost a decade or more of development. In the next five years two thirds of their debt will have to be rolled over or paid off. Austria shares the view that crisis management on a case-by-case basis should be complemented by a comprehensive approach. The serious social and political implications of the debt problem must finally be taken into account. This problem cannot be left as the responsibility of banking institutions alone. Loan conditions which undermine the dignity and well-being of the people endanger democratic institutions.Governments have to contribute their share to the crisis management. We must improve access for developing countries to the markets of industrialized States. Closing our markets to products of developing countries while urging them to earn more money by increasing their exports is a contradiction in itself. Urgent measures have to be taken to help countries suffering from extreme fluctuations in their export earnings. Concerted international action is required to ensure greater monetary stability.We must never forget one essential aspect - that economic progress is not an end in itself; it has to serve the individual. Let me emphasize three points in this respect.First  full respect for the cultural heritage and the social fabric of society is a condition of a life in dignity. Efforts to promote economic development must take this into account.Secondly  economic development to the benefit of all furthers the emancipation of the individual. It facilitates political participation and promotes respect for human rights. It is no less true that democracy and freedom stimulate a people's creative energy and contribute to its economic progress. The two objectives are complementary. Towards both the United Nations has to make a major contribution.Thirdly  improving the quality of life is not a matter only of economic growth rates; it is equally important to solve the pressing environmental problems.Today more than 2 billion people live without adequate water supply. Every year far more them 100 000 square kilometers of forest disappear from the face of the earth. Deserts z ;e spreading; valuable soil is eroding. Many species of plants and animals have already been lost for ever. While the world population continues to expand  the basis of its survival is shrinking. We must intensify our efforts to preserve our earth for future generations as a place where people can live. Therefore we need to strengthen the United Nations Environment program as an instrument of international co-operation in this area.How young people perceive and experience the world of today will shape the world of tomorrow. The International Youth Year in 1985 provides us with an opportunity to focus on the problems of the young.More than ever before the education of a person determines his whole life. It is therefore our duty to provide a solid education preparing young people for professional life. But in many developing countries educational opportunities for young people are lacking  and in some industrial countries existing opportunities are insufficiently utilized.The international community must direct greater attention to these issues. I appeal to all Member States to fight the spreading problem of youth unemployment by joint efforts.Youth unemployment is neither a statistical nor a financial problem. For me  one of the greatest tragedies of our time is that hundreds of thousands of young people live without hope and confidence in their future. He are deeply convinced that there are ways to give hope to your young  if we are determined to make an effort. He raise this matter out of concern for the young people in the world  although in my country  due to a continuing effort by the Austrian Government  the youth unemployment rate is below 5 per cent.Austria intends to submit a draft resolution on this subject. We are also considering an international meeting of experts and youth representatives. Such a meeting could take place in Vienna in the first half of the year 1987 to discuss new ways of dealing with the problem of youth unemployment.Let me now turn to the situation in Africa. No other region poses a greater challenge to international solidarity. In Addis Ababa in July 1985  African Governments courageously declared that they have the primary responsibility for addressing the present crisis. But let this not be an excuse for inaction on thepart of the industrialized countries: the millions of starving Africans will survive only if international relief aid is continued and intensified.I would like to commend the United Nations Secretariat for its efforts in co-ordinating emergency assistance to drought-stricken countries in Africa. This example of international co-operation should inspire us all. If all nations work together the prospects for recovery  growth and development in Africa will brighten. Austria intends further to increase and intensify its efforts.Africa suffers not only from economic hardship but also from severe political problems. The crisis in South Africa has dramatically escalated in recent months. Every day it becomes more evident that the majority of the South African population will no longer tolerate the injustices of apartheid.Austria has always rejected and condemned apartheid. As a political system based on racial discrimination  apartheid negates the very foundation of civilization: the dignity of the human being. Democracy  equal rights and the abolition of all kinds of apartheid should not be an act of grace but the result of a genuine dialog with the leaders of the democratic black organizations.As an organization committed to the promotion of peace  freedom and justice  the United Nations bears a special responsibility to contribute to the elimination of apartheid. We all have to join in the efforts to bring about a peaceful transition to a free and democratic South Africa with equal rights for all.In adopting resolutions 566 (1985) and 569 (1985) the Security Council recommended a set of measures to be adopted by Governments in this regard. The Austrian Government has decided to take the following six autonomous steps in accordance with these resolutions: first  to suspend all investments by Austrian public enterprises in South Africa; secondly  to prohibit the import of krugerrands and all other gold coins minted in South Africa; thirdly  to impose restrictions in the field of sports and cultural relations; fourthly  to stop government guarantees for export credits; fifthly  to prohibit the participation of public enterprises in South African procurement procedures in the nuclear field  although no such case has arisen so far; sixthly  to prohibit all exports of computer equipment that may be used by the South African a nay and police.Austria remains firmly committed to the achievement of freedom for Namibia. The only acceptable basis for Namibia's independence is Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  adopted as much as seven years ago. Yet  in defiance of international law  in defiance of the expressed will of the international community and in disregard of the aspirations of the Namibian people  South Africa continues to obstruct the implementation of the United Nations plan. We reject the installation of a so-called transitional government for Namibia as a further attempt by South Africa to impose a unilateral solution.The situation in Central America has not improved. Centuries of social and economic injustice have resulted in a widespread atmosphere of crisis and despair. The problems of the region must be solved by the countries of the region themselves. Any attempt to introduce elements of the East-West conflict further complicates the situation. The principles of non-interference and the peaceful settlement of disputes must be fully respected.The peace process initiated by the Contadora Group still provides the best chance to achieve a solution. We regret that thus far this peace plan has not been implemented. We want to assure all countries of the Contadora Group of our continuing support.Violence and human suffering continue to characterize the situation in the Middle East. Oppression and terror  mistrust and hatred have made the people suffer through decades of confrontation and war. World peace and international security are directly threatened.Austria's position on the elements of a solution of the Middle East problem remains unchanged. The right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must be respected. The Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East problem. A solution therefore requires the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to their own State. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as the representative of the Palestinians  must participate in the peace process. Israel must withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. Austria supports the proposal to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East. As the only international forum open to all parties to the conflict and all other interested Powers  the United Nations has the capacity and theresponsibility to contribute substantively to peace in the Middle East. During the last months various important initiatives have been undertaken. Prospects for a genuine dialog have improved. It is now essential to maintain the momentum and to remove all existing obstacles to the beginning of negotiations. Both sides have to come to terms with each other's existence and legitimate interests.The Middle East is rich in natural resources  it has a great cultural heritage. If the people of this area could work together in peace  their region could be one of the most prosperous on earth.Almost six years have passed since the military intervention in Afghanistan. We remain deeply concerned about the continuing occupation of this traditionally non-aligned country and the violation of its independence. The suffering of the refugees must not be forgotten. Any solution must enable these refugees to return home in safety and honor. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative in his search for a political settlement.In Kampuchea the military occupation  the use of force  the misery of refugees and the denial of human rights continue. Only negotiations between the parties to the conflict on the basis of the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the International Conference on Kampuchea will lead to a just settlement which could ensure a better future for the severely tried Kampuchean people.I have briefly touched upon some of the conflicts in today's world. No doubt their origins are different. But let us not overlook what they all have in commons violent deaths  human suffering  flows of refugees  destruction of homes and devastation of land. This human dimension of international conflicts should guide our deliberations in the weeks to come.Let me add some words on peace-keeping operations. They are one of the major achievements of the United Nations in the field of international peace and security. Since 1960  almost 25 000 Austrian soldiers have  through their participation in these operations  actively contributed to international stability. We strongly feel that peace-keeping should be strengthened and further developed.One area of special concern is the financing of these operations. We believe that further measures should be taken to alleviate the burden currently borne by troop-contributing countries. A sound financial basis for this vital activity of the United Nations has to be created. Troop-contributing countries  in support of the Secretary-General's appeals  have urged Member States to start or increase voluntary contributions for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFTCYP). Let me again strongly underline this appeal.Developing a network of contacts and co-operation with neighboring countries is a central element of Austria's foreign policy. Close ties - not only between governments but also between peoples - are the best guarantee for fruitful and stable relations. Austria therefore continues to extend and deepen co-operation with all neighboring countries regardless of their political system.Let me say a few words about our relations with Italy. Austria entertains good and friendly relations with this important neighboring country. They were further strengthened by the official visit of Austria's Federal Chancellor to Rome two weeks ago  and in this context the question of South Tyrol is of special importance.In 1969  the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in 1960 and 1961 led to an agreement between Austria and Italy on a new framework for the autonomy of South Tyrol. Since then  a number of measures have been taken to implement this autonomy. Yet  after 16 years some important provisions still remain to be fulfilled. The use of the German language in courts and before civil authorities ranks foremost among the open issues.It appears important to me that the 1969 agreements be implemented without further delay. On the occasion of the recent visit of the Austrian Federal Chancellor to Rome  he received assurances to this end from the Italian Prime Minister  Bettino Craxi. We trust that the Italian Government will take the necessary measures in agreement with the South Tyrolean German-speaking community in order to achieve an early and full realization of the autonomy of South Tyrol.I began my statement by emphasizing that politics have to serve mankind. This is especially true with regard to human rights. In spite of different social and political systems  different interpretations and values  it seems that there is a worldwide growing awareness with regard to the observance of human rights. All our efforts should be aimed at the maintenance  or more so  the acceleration of this momentum.It is not the definition of human rights which is lacking  but their implementation. This implementation requires intensive efforts by every State within its own borders as well as on the regional and global levels. Specific steps within each region to improve the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms are particularly promising. In this context I would like to refer to the successful outcome of the ministerial conference on human rights  held under the auspices of the Council of Europe in Vienna in March 1985.Austria has worked for many years towards one specific goal: namely the restriction or elimination of the death penalty. We seriously hope that progress can be achieved. Austria will continue its endeavors in this respect.The founding of the United Nations 40 years ago was the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to establish institutions and mechanisms to bring peace and progress to the world. The idea is still valid. The institutions and mechanisms are all in place. We are confident that the United Nations can be greatly strengthened if Member States abide by their obligations under the Charter and make constructive use of the Organization. On the occasion of its fortieth anniversary let us all recommit ourselves to the United Nations. The Organization has a vital role to play in promoting peace  justice  freedom and progress for all humanity. To this end  let us unite our efforts."
"8",439,"BDI",40,1985,"I believe that the natural disaster of such terrible extent that has just afflicted Mexico has moved each and everyone of us here. I would therefore like to join my voice with those of other heads of delegation in expressing the deep sympathy of Burundi to the Government and the people of Mexico  particularly in view of the friendly relations that link our two countries. I extend to them our greatest sympathy.The united Nations is about to commemorate its fortieth year of existence with an exceptionally high level of participation by its Members  it is not merely a question of drawing up the balance-sheet of the successes achieved here and there and of the shortcomings of the Organization since its founding  but it is  above all  a question of taking advantage of what we have learned in order better to ensure its future  which is bound up with that of mankind itself.The Head of State of my country. His Excellency Colonel Jean Baptiste Bagaza  his Government and the people of Burundi attach particular importance to this session  which should be the session at which all States Members come together to ensure the survival and progress of mankind. It is for that reason that Burundi was one of the first this year to organize  at the domestic level  a series of activities to heighten the awareness of public opinion with regard to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.It is undoubtedly fortunate that this session of the General Assembly  which will  I trust  have an effective and historic role to play  should be presided over by a man such as the Permanent Representative Spain  a lean with the irreplaceable qualities of ability and broad experience  My delegation welcomes the fact that a son of Spain - a country rich in age-old traditions and a founding Member of our Organization  a country with which my own enjoys excellent relations is guiding our work.I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the thirty-ninth session. His Excellency Ambassador Paul Firmino Lusaka  the Permanent Representative of Zambia to cur organization  for the outstanding work he carried out during his term of office. In the exercise of his duties he performed difficult tasks and lived up to the trust the international community had unanimously placed in him by electing him President last September. That distinguished diplomat is indeed the pride of Africa and of the sister Republic of Zambia.Lastly  I should like to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar . for the many positive  untiring efforts he has made throughout this past year to encourage the international community to maintain or restore a climate of international peace and co-operation. His devotion  his availability and his eclectic spirit  demonstrated at critical moments some of which saw the future of humanity endangered  deserve to be highlighted here.Even a superficial analysis of the present international situation reveals a world in disarray  marked by various tensions and conflicts  a universe being crushed beneath the burden of innumerable economic difficulties  a hostile environment characterized by the arms race  the persistence of the policy of blocs and  as a corollary  the gradually dwindling hope of maintaining permanent detente and the inexorable growth of the specter of war. These are the three main concerns of my delegation at this time: conflict and tension throughout the world  the critical economic situation and the threat which the arras race poses to development. Since the thirty-ninth session  there has been no real improvement in these three areas.This sombre picture is the complete antithesis of the goals and aspirations laid down for the United Nations by its founders 40 years ago.Arising out of the ashes of a devastating war which had sown hatred and desolation throughout the world  the survivors of the Second World War hoped only to make peace and collective security last for ever  to do away with dependence  exploitation and the denial of right and justice in order to rebuild a more viable world in which interdependence and respect among nations would establish new relationships of co-operation and mutual assistance.Forty years of experience - some good  some so good - has led to a United Nations which is very different from the vision that the founders entertained in 1945.From this viewpoint of history  it is certainly significant that the establishment of the United Nations was the logical outcome of close co-operation between the major Powers and many other countries in a period of armed conflict. The differences in their political systems and the disparity in their levels of social organization were major constraints  but they did not interfere with the hopes of achieving victory during that temporary coalition born in a time of trouble. This proves that the international community was able and still is able today to establish beneficial co-operation to save future generations from the threat of war.It was this noble idea that inspired the signers of the San Francisco Charter  who committed themselves on behalf of all the peoples of the earth. All the principles and plans adopted at that time retain their full importance today as some of us have already stressed.If we glance back over the past 40 years of our Organization we have to say that in a world torn and divided the United Nations has not been able to prevent a whole series of armed conflicts in various parts of the world. It has  however  been able to help to avert a world-wide cataclysm by repeatedly acting as a buffer between the various protagonists  offering them an adequate forum in which to discuss differences between nations and machinery that has at times been useful in mediating between belligerents.There is increasing agreement that the United Nations is still the ideal framework for the peaceful settlement of differences and conflicts between Meabers. The major problems that arise are the result of the main weakness of the system: the structures and machinery in place would be largely operational if the political will exited among States  particularly the most powerful States  to find a peaceful settlement to disputes.The Security Council has the primary role in the maintenance of peace. Severe criticism has often been voiced regarding its effectiveness in putting an end to conflict situations and some have advocated a review of the Charter to bring it up to date. Many nations could play a more important role them they do at present and equality between the different nations could be achieved - a sacred tenet of the Charter of our Organization.It has become clear as time has passed that this vision of the world will unfortunately remain confined to the realm of pious wishes as long as certain members of the international community remain self-centered  thus weakening the multilateral role of international relations.Dissatisfaction with regard to multilateralism is mainly due to States that are basically concerned with their own interests  relegating to second place the ideals that were unanimously accepted in 1945. This is a matter of serious concern to my delegation  because that attitude is aggravating the crucial problems of today's world  particularly those of international peace and security  justice and dignity among peoples and nations  international co-operation and the progress of the human race.Forty years after the United Nations was founded we have come to understand that we shall never attain these objectives without the combined efforts of all Member States  particularly in guaranteeing the socio-economic development of the States of Africa  Asia and Latin America  the preservation of the ecological equilibrium of the planet  the exploration and peaceful use of the seas and of outer space  and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinctions as to race  sex  language or religion.Turning to current concerns at the international level  we should first of all highlight the fact that wherever one looks the international political situation  even viewed through a distorting viewpoint of optimism  still contains many areas of deep concern  the most important of which are in the continent of Africa. I refer to the denial of human rights in South Africa and the incomplete decolonization of Namibia and Western Sahara. Having long defied the numerous appeals of the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement to end the abhorrent practices of apartheid. South Africa systematically defies the universal consensus and steps up its system of racial oppression  which is almost as old as our Organization.Strengthened by.the almost overt support of certain powerful allies which enable it to act with impunity  the Republic of South Africa continues to wage armed aggression against independent neighboring States  in flagrant and deliberate violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the elementary norms of international law that govern the conduct of all States. The intention has been to destabilize those States and to set up puppet regimes in its service. In this context  we condemn the recent attacks on Angola and Botswana  which have shocked the conscience of mankind.The establishment of a state of emergency and the statement made last August by President Botha on the future of the blacks have further complicated the already complex problem of South Africa. Despite many pertinent statements from all sides calling on the Security Council finally to exercise its authority and impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter  strategic interests and the prospect of losing the enormous benefits that the allies enjoy as a result of the maintenance of the apartheid regime seem unfortunately to have prevailed. This can be seen in the placatory provisions of Security Council resolution 556 (1985) and the fate that awaited the recent French initiative  which had aroused a great deal of hope.The international community should take the opportunity presented by this session to require Pretoria to put an end to repression  to bantustanization  to the system of banning people and harassing the black leaders who are struggling for their independence. They should halt the harassing and killing of freedom fighters  and they should immediately start a constructive dialog with the oppressed black population  so that their rights will finally be recognized.The active and broad-based support of the international community and the tireless struggle of the South African people themselves will inevitably lead to the abolition of apartheid. Now is the right time to act and to positively influence events. The territory of Namibia  which is under the responsibility of the united Nations  will soon be marking the twentieth anniversary of its illegal occupation by South Africa. During this period the Pretoria regime has developed colonialism  apartheid  aggression  State terrorism  the system of having mercenaries  all of these practices that have been condemned by the international community as a serious threat to international peace and security.At the same time foreign economic activities and interests have been obstructing the path toward complete independence of the valiant Namibian people  under the enlightened leadership of their sole representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  and these activities have been accelerating the systematic plundering of the natural wealth of the Territory in flagrant violation of the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the united Nations and Decree No. 1 on protecting the natural resources of Namibia.My country trusts that the legal proceedings now underway in the courts of States of origin against the multinational corporations that are involved in this plundering  will be speeded up and will include all registered companies.The United Nations Council for Namibia has initiated these actions and they enjoy the full support of my country.Last June  the Republic of Burundi strongly condemned the establishment by the racist regime of South Africa of a puppet government in Windhoek. My country will never recognize such a government  whose appointment is just an additional obstacle set up by Pretoria on the path to the independence of the Namibian people. We believe that no viable solution can be found outside of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which outlined a coherent plan for the immediate independence of Namibia. We would deplore and condemn once again the persistent attempt to link that independence to considerations which are alien to the real issue of Namibia.Since that memorable date of 14 December 1960  which saw the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV)  the right to self-determination has become a cardinal principle of contemporary international law. Many countries have taken up their seat in the concert of nations thanks to the wide implementation of that resolution.For more than a decade our Organization has been strongly reaffirming the right of the Sahraoui people to independence and sovereignty. It is still to be hoped that the recent contacts entered into by the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the Moroccan authorities  and other initiatives  will make it possible to give practical effect to resolution AHS/104 which was adopted at the twentieth conference of Heads of state or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  and we hope that it will be possible swiftly to implement the provisions in General Assembly resolution 39/40.The outbreaks of violence and escalation of aggression by Israel against the Arab and Palestinian peoples in the Middle East  Israel's denial of the universally recognized right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  have been plunging the peoples of that region into indescribable suffering. Israel's intransigence and stubbornness in flaunting the injunctions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council compel us today to express our strong condemnation.The Palestinian people cannot live indefinitely as refugees in their own ind. They wish to live in peace with other peoples in the region. They wish to establish their own state under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole and authentic representative. Moreover  occupying a territory belonging to another country by force is illegal and contrary to the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations  withdrawal from all the occupied territories  including Jerusalem  must be the firm demand of our Organization and a condition for the restoration of peace and stability in that region.Not far from that area  the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  along with the Lebanese crisis which has lasted too long now  impose on the peoples of that region of the world unjust and cruel suffering. These are matters of seriousconcern to the international community. All efforts must be made to ensure a return to peace.Only respect for the norms of law governing international relations  including the non-use of force in relations with one's neighbors  can put an end to this tragedy  which so agonizingly jeopardizes the socio-economic development of peoples in the Middle East.On the other end of the planet  we cannot endorse the invasion of any country by foreign troops. The crisis in Afghanistan and Kampuchea derive from a failure to respect the principles that I have just mentioned. We should take this opportunity to put an end to these anachronistic situations and leave it up to the countries involved to determine the best means of government that would be in keeping with the aspirations of their own peoples  free from untimely interference in their internal affairs.As for the Korean peninsula  my country deplores the fact that the presence of foreign troops in the southern part  hampers the peaceful and independent reunification of that people  which share the same culture of an age-old historical past  and it artificially shatters family ties. Burundi has always maintained and will continue tirelessly to support any proposal which would restore to the Korean people their dignity which has been trampled on and their unity that has been destroyed.As for Latin America and the Caribbean  another area that is subject to instability  we would support the independent path of peoples in the region and we would condemn all forms of foreign domination and interference in the internal affairs of those States.While the conditions of peace and security throughout these parts of the world still remain precarious  the critical economic situation of many countries is the second major concern of the world today.First of all  Z would just deplore the disenchantment felt towards all the multilateral institutions at a time when we should in fact be strengthening international economic co-operation for the benefit of all. The provisions of Chapters IX and X of the Charter of the United Nations gave this Organization a paramount role in promoting progress in the economic and social development of peoples. After all  is there any other place that is more appropriate than the United Nations for discussing supranational natters concerning the means of co-ordinating national and international measures in a world where we no longer have to demonstrate that economic interdependence is a reality.Taking account of the extent and complexity of the problems facing countries in the area of international trade  monetary instability  financial questions  indebtedness  we must show imagination  we must make use of the Charter and strengthen the spirit of dialog and harmonization  which is indeed sadly lacking today.How can we understand that resolution 34/138  dealing with global negotiations for the establishment of a new International Economic Order  which was adopted unanimously seven years ago  has remained a dead letter? In the Bean time there has been a dangerous deterioration in the economic situation of many developing countries.The least favored nations  whose fragile economies are further worsened by the present international economic situation  are to be found in Africa. There we find intolerable poverty and devastating famine. There  agriculture  industry  transport and communications do not benefit from the technological advances of this age. It is this continent that has had the most unjust and humiliating fate in history.The international community recognized this reality when at its last session the General Assembly adopted resolution 39/29 on the critical economic situation in Africa. The annex to that resolution specifically called for a commitment by the international community to support the Governments and peoples of Africa in their struggle for survival. There were three stages in that difficult task: emergency aid for peoples suffering from famine and malnutrition  medium-term assistance for the rehabilitation of agriculture and livestock rearing  and long-term aid to make African economies growth-oriented. Africa has tremendous economic potential  which only needs to be exploited for the well being of its people. But the financial  technological means and human resources are lacking. At the present time the African countries are unable on an individual level to take up the challenge.That is why the Heads of State and Government  at the twenty-first Conference of the Organization of African unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa last July dealt primarily with the economic situation in Africa  and reaffirmed their faith in the Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos which for us is a basic reference document for the economic and social development of our continent. They adopted a five-year emergency program for the recovery of African economies. This program  entitled the Joint Action-Oriented Platform  is an effort to vitalize sub-regional and regional co-operation and to mobilize outside inputs to support our own efforts. The priority areas are agriculture and food  transport and communications  industry  trade and finance  science and technology  and lastly  as the main point  human resources.The African countries have collectively committed themselves to strengthening their unity and solidarity in implementing this program. They count on the active support of the international community  particularly that of the United Nations system. Taking account of the technological backwardness of Africa  the specialized agencies should provide us with special treatment  particularly in the areas of technical co-operation  training and research. Other major handicaps have to be taken into consideration also: 26 of the 36 least developed countries are African  some of them are also land-locked and stricken by drought and desertification  and most of the other African countries have extremely low incomes.To deal with all these dangers  the support of the international agencies should be directed towards the following priorities: in the field of agriculture and food  increasing the capacity for agricultural output. The financing bodies for development should provide liquidity at levels compatible with the needs of the developing countries  particularly the African ones. Those that have resources should take action in accordance with the established priorities and should provide flexible loan conditions. In this connection  the reconstitution of the International Development Association (IDA) at a level equal at least to $12 billion  and the provision of Africa's share in allocating the resources of that institution  should be a major priority. The reconstitution of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) at a level consonant with the agricultural development needs of third world countries is also very necessary. Easing the external Indebtedness of Africa and respecting the commitments entered into by the developed countries towards the least developed countries are also essential measures for the economic growth of Africa.However  as long as the terms of trade and the prices of commodities maintain their present trend  the major problem of the African countries will remain untouched. He must establish fair remunerative and stable prices for commodities so as to increase export earnings and limit the deterioration in the terms of trade. This is obviously the key issue of development and stability for our economies.And lastly  I must emphasize that some specific actions undertaken within the context of international co-operation  for example  the vaccination campaign to immunize all children of the world by the year 1990  are indeed commendable and should enjoy the support of our States.Naturally  Africa also counts a great deal on South-South co-operation. It will participate actively in the joint projects in this co-operation  particularly in the global system of trade preferences among developing countries  the multi-sector information network  the South-Bank Project  the exchange of appropriate technology  and so forth. But here  what is needed more than the program is the political will of the States.Against this background  we feel that the request of the twenty-first summit of Heads of State and Government of Africa to convene a special session of the General Assembly to take up questions relating to the critical economic situation in Africa should be given the support of this Assembly. Apart from problems of peace and security  and the major concerns arising out of the economic situation  the third major concern of our Organization is the arm race  and more specifically the nuclear arms race which continues to loom over us.Because of the threat to the survival of mankind presented by nuclear and chemical weapons  which are now being extended to cuter space  the question of negotiating arms limitations and disarmament is a matter that is of concern not only to the major Powers that are directly involved  although it is their primary responsibility. The entire world  including the populations of the nuclear Powers themselves  must exercise constant pressure for a freeze in the development  production  storage and deployment of nuclear and chemical weapons  the first stage in a process aimed at the reduction and total destruction of stockpiles of these weapons. This is a question not only of the survival of mankind  but also of the welfare of mankind  since the human and material resources that would be freed because a freeze could then be developed to ensure the well-being of mankind. This is a dream which this Organization and each one of our countries must try to transform into a reality over the years to come.In Burundi this is a dream for us also because we believe in the common future of mankinJ  and because it is increasingly clear that the world  despite its diversity  despite the conflict in the ideas  beliefs and interests of our various States  constitutes a single whole as far as many problems are concerned.On the eve of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we must make a decisions either States consider it as an instrument to ensure that their views prevail to the detriment of others  and thus it would be a forum for confrontation and antagonism; or else States make of it a political system for harmonization  solidarity and interdependence  and thus a forum for the search for peace and collective security  justice and balance  economic and social well-being. It is the latter option that we must take; that is the option which my country will pursue within the United Nations.Let us therefore strengthen the machinery provided in the Charter of this Organization  as proposed by the Secretary-General  particularly the collective system for the maintenance of international peace and security. Let us here enter into the commitment to try to reduce tension  to use our Organization as a forum for multilateral disarmament  taking note of the link between disarmament and development. Let us resolve and be sufficiently politically responsible to recognize that this Organization has the mandate to promote the economic and social well-being of all its Members by establishing fairness and balance in international economic relations.That is the only way for this session to make the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations a historic milestone."
"9",486,"BEL",40,1985," Allow me first of all to offer my warmest congratulations to Mr. de Pinies on his accession to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.His remarkably broad experience - it is indeed the twenty-eighth time he has attended the proceedings of our Assembly - as well as the prestige and authority he has thus acquired constitute the best guarantee of success in our work. My country is delighted at the election of a representative of Spain  a country it holds particularly dear and which is about to join the European Community.Before starting my statement. I wish to express to the Government and people of Mexico my deepest sympathy for the terrible tragedy which they have just suffered.In the troubled world in which we live  our Organization has been fulfilling for 40 years now the essential task of helping to resolve world problems and to ensure that harmonious international relations prevail. This session  which is meant to celebrate this event  instills in many of us the hope for renewed energy and for a renewed awareness of the need to accomplish the tasks set out by the founders of our Organization.I have no doubt that under the wise guidance of Mr. de Pinies the Assembly will go down in the annals of the United Nations as having contributed effectively to the fulfillment of the ideals and purposes of our Charter.I should also like to reiterate here the expression of our deep appreciation for the devotion and effectiveness shown by Mr. de Pinies eminent predecessor  Ambassador Lusaka  in discharging his high functions.As always  I took keen note of this year's report submitted by the Secretary-General. How can we not share his concerns with respect to multilateralism in this anniversary year? How can we fail to heed his insistent appeals for greater solidarity and for the establishment of a system of international relations which takes fully into account the obligations and responsibilities which have fallen to us as Members of the United Nations? How can we fail to respond to his request for profound reflection at a high level on the objectives  accomplishments and shortcomings of our Organization  which is about to celebrate its fortieth anniversary?How  finally  can we remain indifferent to the assaults on the universal character of our Organization or ignore its historic deficiencies? Suffice it for the moment to refer to the example of the Korean Peninsula. Its reunification presupposes a peaceful and democratic solution to the problems that separate the two parts. My country shares the view of the Republic of Korea that direct talks between the two parts must first a ink at restoring the climate of confidence which has been lacking for so long. While we wait for this dialog  which we strongly encourage  lead to reunification  Belgium favors the simultaneous entry of the two Koreas to the United Nations.My colleague from Luxembourg  Mr. Poos  the current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  has faithfully reflected from this rostrum the views of the ten member States  including Belgium  on the whole range of international questions which now more than ever are of concern to the world community.I wish to thank my colleague for his statement  because it allows me to focus my comments on a few subjects which seem of particular interest to me. Whether we wish it or not  the international situation remains strongly marked by the state of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies.last year I had the opportunity to point out from this rostrum how bleak the outlook was with regard to East-West relations. Since then  the situation has not really improved. Distrust is prevalent everywhere and paralyzes attempts to resolve the many problems of the world. This climate of incomprehension and mutual fear has deep roots. The uninterrupted large-scale deployment of nuclear missiles aimed at Western Europe has led my country  together with others  to accept deployment on its territory of cruise missiles. This difficult political decision does not reflect any bellicose sentiment or aggressive intentions; it is the inevitable consequence of legitimate fear due to sustained military pressure by which the balance of forces had been undone. It is this dangerous spiral of threats  distrust and fear which we have tried to slow down and  if possible  to break.The proposals we made at the Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe in Stockholm went in that direction. They were ambitious in scope - which was to make disarmament possible by rebuilding confidence - but modest and perfectly workable as far as their implementation was concerned. They did not tend to put obstacles in the path of security agreements but  on the contrary  to favor small steps towards the lessening of tensions. Accordingly  Belgium attaches great importance to two elements of the rather gloomy picture of East-West relations  which in the course of the last months have given rise to some glimmer of hope.On 12 March 1985 the United States and the Soviet Union resumed in Geneva negotiations on strategic arms  intermediate nuclear forces and space weapons. Belgium considers these negotiations as being of the greatest importance. It seeks as sweeping a reduction as possible of the number of existing systems  with due consideration  however  of the balance and stability of the strategic relationship between the two parties. New technologies  particularly in outer space  cannot be implemented unless they strengthen that stability.Also in Geneva  the President of the United States of America and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will meet in November. Belgium  like all other nations  expects this summit meeting to contribute to breaking the barrier of distrust  the ill effects of which I denounced earlier. It also expects it to lead to a constructive dialog of which the whole world and not only the participants is in great need.It is in Geneva as well that the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament take place. In this context  and without wanting to minimize the importance of other points of discussion  I should like to broach the question of chemical weapons. We were horrified by the use of chemical agents in recent conflicts. We will never forget that Belgium was the first battlefield where such weapons were used. One of the agents is called Yperite after the name of the Flemish city of Ypres  which since 1916 has become famous throughout the world. My country is  therefore  in a very good position to request: full and unconditional compliance with the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which bans the use of chemical weapons; the conclusion of a new international convention which totally prohibits not just solely the use but also the production  stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons. In 1984  a draft to that effect was submitted at the Conference on Disarmament by the Vice-President of the united states. It is urgent that the conference reach an agreement on this point.Belgium  for its part  has already decided to put stricter controls on the export of ""key precursors""  that is to say  the basic elements in the composition of toxic weapons. But here  as elsewhere  the crucial problem underlying disarmament agreements remains the setting up of an adequate verification system. Verification is the indispensable element of any security and disarmament agreement. He who rejects verification bears the responsibility for failure. Only openness and transparency will allow us to lessen the distrust  to relax the atmosphere and to move on to a more secure climate.In the same spirit; I should like to appeal for scrupulous compliance with the agreements already concluded in the field of disarmament and security. Nothing fosters distrust more than the suspicion that commitments already undertaken are not  or not fully  coupled with. This is not a question of accusations or polemics. Let us simply acknowledge that if existing agreements are not implemented in good faith  it will become more difficult to conclude new ones.At the end of July  in Helsinki  I said that I felt some disappointment with regard to the manner in which certain previsions of the Fined. Act had been implemented. Frankness compels me to repeat that  in my view  the great expectations which had been placed in that Act have not been fully met. The outcome of the Ottawa Conference on Human Rights is but an illustration of the pitfalls we find in our path. I persist  however  in believing that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process may still be improved and supplemented. Belgium  for its part  will prove itself to be persevering and determined with regard to the further development of this process. We cannot allow ourselves to be pessimistic on this point.If on the multilateral level we did not spare any effort in favor of disarmament and peace  on the bilateral level also we have translated our principles into action. Belgium has always declared itself ready to enter into a dialog with countries wishing to do so and has not failed to play to the full its role in the concert of nations. This role involves establishing contacts  using restraint and establishing credibility and reliability with respect to our existing commitments.East-West rivalry and the confrontation between the nuclear Powers are not the only threats to international life. Because of tradition and historical bonds  my country is particularly interested in the African continent  whose severe crisis is still a source of concern.Today  economic difficulties  drought  agricultural crises and food shortages are in many places complicated and their consequences multiplied by armed conflicts  internal disturbances and international confrontations. The combination of these situations has ultimately given overwhelming dimensions to these evils. TOO many African countries experience poverty  which carries in its wake suffering  death and displacement of populations fleeing natural calamities and the disasters of world.In the face of this situation  the international community did not remain indifferent. Under the momentum given to us by our Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  measures have been taken  and continue to be taken  to meet the most urgent needs of the African peoples. In order to achieve greater effectiveness  the co-ordination of the aid has been strengthened at the levels of the various organs of the United Nations as well as of the donor countries.This effort must be continued and supplemented through longer-term actions geared towards the development of the populations. Among these long-term actions my country gives the highest priority to integrated rural development  the only lasting solution to the problems of hunger and malnutrition  the only means of fighting rural exodus and anarchic urban growth. It is at this goal of development of rural areas that Belgium aimed when it established the Survival Fund for the Third World to help the famine-stricken countries to recover and to improve their food production in order to achieve self-sufficiency.In October 1983  with the help of four United Nations agencies  we selected the countries of the Horn of Africa as beneficiaries because it is one of the regions of the world where due to starvation the mortality rate is one of the highest.Since the end 1984  Belgium  together with various non-governmentalorganizations  is also engaged in a series of emergency aid operations in several drought-stricken African countries. This aid  in equipment or cereals  is today indispensable  but is obviously not enough. He consider development aid to developing countries as the first duty of industrialized countries.At this time  when the international crisis is hitting all countries  but more severely the developing countries  international solidarity together with a sense of responsibility is necessary now more than ever before.The decade of the seventies has favored infrastructural development which was an indispensable phase. However  some reforms of another kind are just as necessary.It is in this context that I wish to call to mind the tragic events which in recent months have taken place in South Africa.Racial discrimination leads to violent confrontation  with the number of innocent victims running into the hundreds. The threat of civil war looms larger with it its train of suffering and misery leading to the economic collapse of half the continent. Like so many others  I  too  should like to appeal  from this rostrum  to the Government of the Republic of South Africa to undertake forthwith the dismantling of apartheid which Belgium condemns unreservedly. My country appeals to all South Africans to move towards constructive dialog. My Government ventures to hope that in each community  responsible leaders will be found who  leaving aside violence and slogans  will seek original solutions to complex problems. No citizen of South Africa  regardless of the color of his skin  stands to gain from a bloodbath or economic chaos. As Mr. Poos stated  on behalf of the Ten  I believe that the only solution lies in granting equal rights to all citizens of South Africa  within a system of protection of minorities and the dialog that I have just mentioned. Through its clear action  Belgium  together with the Ten  hopes to convince the South Africans to adopt such a policy.It is in this spirit that Belgium together with its partners in the European Community  decided to take restrictive as well as positive measures vis-k-vis South Africa. Belgium  as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  insists that the Namibian question be resolved as soon as possible on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It is convinced that the settlement of this problem will lessen tensions in the region  thus initiating an overall evolution in the situation in southern Africa. This makes us insist on the need for an urgent solution to that problem.Finally  I should like to tackle the issue of terrorism  an evil which today encompasses the whole world.At his press conference of 21 June 1985  the Secretary-General stated the following at the time of the taking of hostages on the TWA plane:""As a human being  I have a feeling of shame. I think that what the terrorists are doing all over the world is not only  a crime but also an act of cowardice. I believe that you all share with me this feeling of shame. It is not a matter of ideologies; it is not a matter of religious beliefs. I think it is a matter that affects our conscience as human beings."" I should like to join with the Secretary-General and respond to the appeal he made to us as citizens of the world and as mere human beings.I am not unaware of the difficulty of the response to be given and of the efforts already undertaken by our Organization.As early as 1972  on the occasion of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly  the Secretary-General of the United Nations took the initiative to submit this problem for discussion by the General Assembly and requested the Member States to inform him of their comments on this subject.Resolutions were adopted and a special committee was set up to study the question and to make proposals in order to find effective solutions to the problem of terrorism.However  we were unable to reach consensus. The discussions were not cJnfined to principle and law  but led to a political confrontation between countries favoring total suppression of terrorism and countries which considered that they would rather look into its causes. Of course  international terrorism cannot be eradicated completely without an improvement in the political  economic and social situations which encourage it.Nevertheless  terrorism cannot be a means that is justified by the goals it pursues. There are acts which are so barbaric  so heinous  and so contrary to society that nothing can justify them. Unless we acknowledge these  the fight against international terrorism will be completely paralyzed.Given the aggravation of international terrorism which threatens the lives and the security of innocent people all over the world  the time has crane to determine the criteria for acts which cannot be justified or excused  notwithstanding the sympathy and understanding which some political  cultural  social or economic situations may arouse. It seems urgent to us to establish  ever and beyond all ideological confrontation  a series of universally recognized measures against those criminal acts. The view that assaults  the taking of hostages and other such criminal behavior  are acts which call for leniency because of their political nature and may be committed with impunity by their perpetrators  can no longer be tolerated.It is  no doubt  encouraging to see that various measures and regulations have already been agreed on at the regional and the sectoral levels.At the regional level  I should like to mention in particular the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which  after thorough discussions  has just been adopted by the Belgium Parliament. Consequently  this Convention will be in force among the 15 member States of the Council of Europe united in their struggle against that scourge.The so-called partial approach has  furthermore? allowed the international community to legislate on various kinds of terrorism. I am referring to the Tokyo  Montreal and The Hague Conventions concluded within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) framework. They have all been ratified by Belgium as well as the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. That Convention will soon be submitted for approval to the Belgium Parliament  Thus  Belgium has already adopted the approach recommended in the resolution on terrorism adopted unanimously fay the Seventh United Nations .Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders which was held recently in Milan.Experience has shown that no country is safe from terrorism. The drafting of a general convention on international terrorism is doubtless a goal which is too ambitious  which probably cannot be reached in the near future. It would be better  I think  to try to resolve the problem by considering its various aspects successively. Any system of terror runs counter to the principles of the United Nations Charter and it is therefore Incumbent upon Member States to help to eradicate it.The efforts to be made at the multilateral level  within the United Nations  must also be supplemented by bilateral agreements. Discrepancies between legislations and the sensitiveness of national sovereignty should not allow terrorists to escape punishment.Among the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism were certain proposals which meet our concerns and which I should like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly: the recommendations to the appropriate specialized agencies and to the regional organizations  to consider measures likely to prevent and to combat international terrorism within their fields of competence and in their region; an invitation to all Member States to co-operate more closely  especially by exchanging relevant information on preventive measures and on the struggle against international terrorism  by entering into special treaties or by incorporating in the appropriate bilateral treaties special provisions  in particular with regard to the application of the principle of ""extradition or prosecution"" to international terrorists; and the consideration by the General Assembly of the need to work out one or more additional international conventions based on the principle of ""extradition or prosecution"" to combat acts of international terrorism which are not yet covered by other international Conventions of a similar nature.I have already mentioned the European Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. In Article I this Convention enumerates a certain number of acts which are not to be considered as political offenses. Among them are  in particular  offenses involving the use of a bomb  grenade  rocket  automatic firearm or letter or parcel bomb if this use endangers persons"".Would it  for instance  not be conceivable to give special attention to the use of booby-trapped devices  as was already done to the taking of hostages. It is certain that the use of such devices is a particularly heinous act when it is prone to endanger the life and physical integrity of innocent people.The raison d'etre of our Organization is to preserve  in spite of rivalries and confrontations  a climate of peace in the world. It seemed to me that at this time the preservation of this climate is particularly linked to the resumption of the East-West dialog  to action against hunger and poverty in the world  particularly in Africa  and to practical measures against international terrorism. This was the message I wished to bring to this Assembly."
"10",532,"BEN",40,1985,"I am especially pleased to address the Assembly at a time when it is marking the fortieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. On behalf of my delegation  I take this opportunity to express our sincerest wishes for the strengthening of our Organization  which for 40 years has been able to preserve mankind from the scourge of a third world war.My delegation is particularly gratified by the unanimous election of Ambassador de Piniés to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fortieth session and fully endorses the warm congratulations that have been addressed to him  a deserving tribute to his talents as an experienced diplomat well versed in the ways of our Organization. That is the most certain earnest of the success of cur work. His election is also a tribute to his great and beautiful country  Spain. His predecessor  a worthy son of Africa  Mr. Paul Lusaka  successfully guided the work of the thirty-ninth session with wisdom  efficiency and firmness.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has once again in his annual report demonstrated the great courage and extraordinary far-sightedness for which he has always been so well known. Here I should like once again to renew my country's firm support for the way he is carrying out his lofty and onerous mission.I wish to associate myself with preceding speakers to convey to the people and the Government of Mexico the deep sympathy of the people and the Government of Benin  in view of the earthquakes that ravaged Mexico City causing great loss of life and enormous property damage.There is no more appropriate forum than the current session for dealing with those crucial problems that continue to confront our world today. We must work to bring about a world free from the fear of a nuclear holocaust  a world of security and peace. We must work to safeguard the rights of individuals and peoples and the establishment of a new international economic order. We must combat hunger and disease.Unfortunately  despite the efforts made by every State and the numerous resolutions adopted here in this very Hall during the preceding sessions of the past 40 years  we are obliged to note that the international political situation is causing increasing concern and that numerous problems on which international peace and security hinge remain unresolved. Horse still  these problems continue to worsen because of the duplicity and diabolical maneuvers of some countries which cynically turn difficult situations to their own advantage.It is totally inadmissible that today  40 years after the emergence of our Organization  some people still live under colonial domination. Hence the situation prevailing in southern Africa deserves particular attention by the international community.Although the question of Namibia has been on the agenda of all the regular and special sessions of the General Assembly since the adoption in 1946 of resolution 65 (I)  the racist regime of South Africa continues to apply its odious annexationist and colonialist policy. This arrogant attitude of South Africa  based on total disregard for black peoples  united Nations resolutions and  consequently  the entire international community  is based on the more or less active support of certain circles which long for the days of colonialism and are determined champions of any and all neo-colonialist adventures designed to subjugate third-world countries.Defying the United Nations settlement plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  South Africa has set up a so-called interim government in Namibia. Benin vigorously condemns the establishment of the puppet interim government in Namibia and welcomes the unanimous indignation against and condemnation of the international community this illegal act of South Africa has caused throughout the world.On this occasion my delegation reaffirms once again its unswerving support for the South West Africa Peoples Organization (SHAPO) and solemnly appeals to allcountries that cherish peace and justice to do all in their power to support the colonized and exploited Namibian people in its just struggle to rid itself of the South African monster and restore its national sovereignty.There is no need to reiterate here Pretoria's crises and the atrocities of which the apartheid Engine is daily guilty within the Republic of South Africa itself.After the pseudo-constitutional reforms and the electoral masquerade which was Massively boycotted by mixed and Indian populations  the Pretoria racists continued to strengthen their despicable policy of blind  bloody and barbaric repression  mass arrests and the physical elimination of blacks.The establishment of a state of emergency in 36 districts of the country is clear evidence of the confusion sown by the apartheid regime  confronted by the determination of the South African peoples  who wish to live in an egalitarian nation and who  under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  shrink at no sacrifice to defend their rights as free men. This is now an appropriate time to hail the unshakable courage of Nelson Mandela  a worthy son of Africa  of whom we demand the unconditional and immediate liberation.The virtually continuous acts of aggression perpetrated against Angola Mozambique and the other front-line countries illustrate the desire of South Africa to destabilize the countries of this region.The Beninese people once again would like to express  through me  to all the peoples of southern Africa and in particular to the people of Angola its unswerving support and militant solidarity.Today more than ever  the international community is convinced of the absolute need to apply global and binding sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter against the racist regime of South Africa.He must welcome the fact that peace- and justice-loving States have finally understood that only strong sanctions against South Africa are likely to put an end to this great blot on mankind. We urge them to exercise all possible forms of pressure on Pretoria until our world is freed of the repugnant scourge of apartheid.Finally I take this opportunity to reaffirm my country's full support of the AHC in its heroic struggle for peace  liberty  equality and social justice in South Africa.The misfortunes of the South African people can be compared only with those of the Palestinian people hunted down and persecuted on its own land in the Middle East. The conflicts in this region continue to cause death  suffering  misery and deprivation of all sorts. Defying the efforts of the international community for a just and equitable solution of the Palestinian issue  Israel engages in acts of aggression directed against independent and sovereign countries. The recent case of barbaric aggression against Tunisia gave rise  and justly so  to practically unanimous condemnation by the international community. We vigorously condemn that act and reaffirm our support of the PLC and of the Tunisian people.These terrorist expeditions far from intimidating the Palestinian people only strengthen its determination to struggle towards the recovery of its inalienable rights. Israel must finally acknowledge that the settlement of the Palestinian question must include its immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967.With regard to Lebanon  the Beninese people hope to see that country emerge once and for all from the political crisis that has been besetting it so that it may effectively achieve its national unity and embark with determination on the task of reconstruction for the well-being of the whole Lebanese people.As for the dispute which has for five years now been pitting Iran against Iraq  we fear that recent events in that merciless war waged by these two fraternal countries is now increasing the risk of the internationalization of that armed conflict.In addition  massive acts of destruction carried out through the bombing of cities will not encourage efforts at development by the Iranian and Iraqi peoples  whose casualties are now innumerable.My delegation therefore again urges Iran and Iraq to sit down at the negotiating table in order peacefully to settle the dispute that divides them and restore peace to their two peoples and to the international community.My delegation's position in regard to the situation in Chad remains unchanged. We are convinced that only total peace and an effective reconciliation of all the sons of Chad can allow that people to engage  in peace and harmony  in the enormous task of rebuilding their country  so severely affected by years of civil war.My country therefore supports all efforts aimed at establishing peace and harmony in Chad through a union of all citizens of Chad.Once again it is clear that peace and security in the world inevitably depend on the elimination of all these focal points of tension which the great Powers and their allies unfortunately insist on maintaining.Despite the relevant resolution of the nineteenth summit of the Organization of African unity (OAU) regarding the western Sahara approved by the General Assembly at its thirty eighth session  Western Sahara continues to be the victim of acts of aggression carried out by those who do not shrink at any crime whatever to satisfy their imperialist designs and egoist interests.My delegation  faithful to the principle of the right to self-determination of all peoples  once again urges the General Assembly to do everything it can to ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations on Western Sahara.The situation in Central America and in Asia is of just as much concern as those in the Middle East and in Africa. In the face of flagrant and daily violations of the legitimate rights and sovereignty of all the States in Central America  the international community must react with greater firmness and demand peace for all peoples of that region.My delegation would like here to renew its support for the just struggle of all the oppressed peoples of Central America for their liberation from all forms of domination and exploitation and unreservedly supports the tireless efforts exerted by the Contadora Group in the search for peace.In Asia the division of the Korean peninsula constitutes a source of tension in that part of the world.Benin cherishes the firm and ardent hope of seeing the sons of Korea once again return to the path of dialog that will bring them to a peaceful and independent reunification of their common homeland.I take the present opportunity to say how much my country appreciates the numerous efforts continuously made by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to implement this objective  which is supported by the whole international community because it is a champion of peace and security for our world of today. To this end it is important that all foreign forces be withdrawn from Korea so as to enable that country's sons to achieve a final settlement of their problem free from foreign interference.In the present international situation characterized by the struggle being waged by the threat Powers for military supremacy  the people of the whole world expect the United Nations to concentrate its efforts on finding a solution to the most crucial pro! em of our time  namely  the cessation of the arms race and the prevention of nuclear war.My delegation is convinced that the problem of disarmament must take pride of place in the concerns of the present session of our General Assembly and must be dealt with objectively  with common sense and realism.The exclusion of outer space from the sphere of the arms race must be treated as an issue that is closely linked to the global problem of preventing nuclear war and the United Nations must exert all its influence to combat any plans for the militarization of outer apace and do everything in its power to ensure that negotiations are undertaken immediately on this problem at the bilateral as well as multilateral level.On the economic level it is regrettable that after 40 years of existence the mission of the United Nations still remains hampered by the egoism of the rich countries. In fact  the situation remains characterized by an unjust international division of labor. The countries of the third world  suppliers of cheap raw materials  continue to feed the factories of the developed countries for whom they form an enormous market outlet for finished products. In addition  the difficult efforts of economic restructuring undertaken by the developing countries are wiped out by the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade.Therefore  the international economic order which prevails in our world today is that of imperialist domination  the pillage of the resources of third world countries and the exploitation of their peoples.It therefore follows naturally that those countries which are called developing countries  but which over the years have in fact been sinking into total poverty  see their dependence on the countries of the North increasing every day as a result of the steady increase in the size of their external debts.It is generally acknowledged that a charge of 20 to 25 per cent of export earnings for debt servicing is an unbearable burden for the economy of any countries. Yet the relevant figures for most of the third world countries go well beyond such levels  and the forecasts are even more gloomy.The deplorable consequence of this situation is the present economic crisis which Africa is now experiencing  despite its vast riches and its great potential. All forecasts indicate that the threat of disaster will continue to loom over this continent for almost all of the coming decade  and the World Bank has warned us that in the South of the Sahara per capita income is likely to continue to decline  so that by 1995 four out of five Africans will be below the absolute poverty level.In the circumstances there is no prospect of relief for the third world in general and for Africa in particular unless the international community reacts immediately to put an end to the present economic system  which has shown its obvious drawbacks during the forty years of existence of our Organization.Africa  for its part  has shown its awareness of the threat which looms over it and is devoting the twenty-first summit conference of the Organization of African unity (OAU) to economic issues and an assessment of the implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action. This assessment has made it clear that most of the suggested projects have not been carried out because of a lack of funds.It is to meet these needs that the OAU created the special emergency assistance fund to combat drought and famine in Africa.While thus shouldering its responsibilities  Africa also has resolved to achieve self-sufficiency in food in order to put an end to famine  malnutrition and endemic illnesses in the continent.The twenty-first summit conference of the OAU also decided to convene an international conference on Africa's external debt. My delegation cherishes the hope that the international community will be able to take advantage of this opportunity  in default of proposals for a broader-based conference at an earlier date  to simply deferring payment on all the present debts of the third world. This action should be understood as a contribution made by the developed countries to the implementation in the developing countries of minimal conditions for making use of the indispensable international assistance which is needed for their economic and social growth.The General Assembly will undoubtedly respond to the urgent appeal of the OAU to convene a special session to consider questions relative to the critical economic situation now prevailing in Africa. We should like here to express ourgreat gratitude to the international community which reacted so positively to the alarming situation now existing in Africa.The establishment of a new international economic order implies a radical transformation of the present abrasive economic relations between North and South.The magnitude and complexity of the present problems of the international community require of our respective countries a steadfast political will to confront all these dangers which threaten the security and peace to which all mankind aspires.The United Nations and its specialized agencies have demonstrated over the past 40 years that they are important forums whose mission is to unite all States on the basis of equality in order to maintain and strengthen that international peace and security. The People's Republic of Benin is convinced that it is possible to increase the effectiveness of this Organization through a serious effort to revise its Charter with respect to all provisions which are no longer in line with the realities of our times. The important questions of equitable representation of nations in the Security Council and the right of veto should be dealt with within this framework to ensure better application of the rights of peoples to self-determination with respect for the sovereignty and equality of States.Regarding the prevailing situation in the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  my country hopes that the great and noble mission of UNESCO to ensure that human civilization thrives will continue on a normal basis with effective participation by all States devoted to peace and justice. My delegation would like to appeal to all countries to ensure that in the higher interests of mankind a frank and sincere dialog be established directed to the resumption of the active participation of all countries and all peoples in that organization.Similarly  ray country supports the actions undertaken by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to ensure the immunization of all children by 1990.In conclusion  I firmly hope that the work of the present session of the General Assembly will enable this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations to be a starting point for a new era during which our Organization will be able to take oh an ever-greater role within the international community as a true guarantor of international peace and security  and serve as a forum for advancing the harmonious development of all countries and the emancipation of all the peoples of our planet.We are ready for the revolution. The struggle continues."
"11",577,"BFA",40,1985,"As we begin our work the Government and friendly people of Mexico are faced with a most terrible disaster as a result of the successive earthquakes that have devastated that country during the past week.On behalf of the people of Burkina Faso and the National Revolutionary Council and its Chairman  Captain Thomas Sankara  I convey to the people and Government of Mexico ray delegation's heartfelt condolences and express to them our greatest solidarity at this time of tragedy. We in Burkina Faso have also suffered from natural disasters  and we are in a position to understand the tragedy that has struck Mexico and its people.My delegation is pleased to see you. Sir  presiding over the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. You represent a country that is close to Africa  for Spain  by virtue of its geography and history  has always been a link between Africa and Europe. I wish to pay a sincere and well-deserved tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Paul John Lusaka  who successfully presided over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.In a few days' time all the peoples and nations of the world will be marking the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. It would be presumptuous to try in a few short minutes to evaluate this Organization 40 years after its founding and it is not the intention of my delegation to do this.We have come to this rostrum to enable our people  the Burkinabe people  and our country  Burkina Faso  to share their thoughts with the other 158 Members of the United Nations. We believe that all our positive and constructive thoughts taken together will undoubtedly present the truest possible picture of the United Nations.The life expectancy of a citizen of Burkina Faso is 40 years. This explains and helps to show why in Burkina Faso it is our deepest aspiration and our most sincere wish to see the United Nations develop and make progress. That is why we struggle to ensure that the United Nations contributes a little more each day to making this a better world for everybody.The work that we have done together in 40 years is positive. The family circle has widened  the number of Members has trebled and all Members have more or less adhered to the principles and ideals contained in the Charter. It is nevertheless true that when it comes to implementation the noble ideas underlying the Charter have not always had the support of the indispensable common political will.Forty years after the San Francisco profession of faith  decolonization has not yet been fully achieved  in Africa in particular and elsewhere in the world.Forty years after Hiroshima  the specter of nuclear war still hovers over the human race and may at any moment jeopardize its future.Although the united Nations has to a certain extent helped us to avoid a third world war such as the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45  the balance sheet of local conflicts since 1945  were it to be drawn up  would be just as terrifying as that of the last war.The fascism and institutionalized racial discrimination that the world thought it had conquered and buried with the defeat of Nazism have reemerged in South Africa and Israel  where they are arrogantly practiced before the eyes of the international community through the abhorrent systems of apartheid and ZionismEven worse is the cynical use made of the weapon of obscurantism and hunger  which every year kills 30 million children  women and men  particularly in my country and in the African Sahel. In our view  this weapon is just as deadly as the nuclear weapon. Indeed  it is even more deadly in that it makes possible more effective forms of political blackmail. It enables the powerful of this world to pour out millions of tons of food aid so as to quieten and lend moral comfort to their own domestic public opinion on the one hand and on the other hand to convince those who are starving that their only means of salvation will for ever lie in the humanitarian gestures of the powerful. Thus  to demand the means to produce food oneself instead of accepting humiliating aid may be presented as a rejection of human solidarity in the face of children  mothers and fathers dying of hunger.The problem of the external debt must be considered in close relationship to the requirements of development by and for the people themselves.Addressing his colleagues at the last summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) President Thomas Sankara  said:""The Burkinabe - that is  a people made up of upright and honest men -will use no trickery  deceit or dishonesty against anyone. That is why  without complaint and in dignified silence  we shall discharge our foreign debt correctly while following the sacred path of the liberation of our people. We shall struggle against the straitjacket that has been imposed on us with no sign of weakness  without resignation or fatalism  but honestly and faithfully. How can one demand that peoples who have been excluded from the feast should pay off a debt of which they know nothing? What would our working masses say if they knew that this debt  which causes us so much worry  represents only 1 per cent of the world debt?""The current debt burden prevents any true economic recovery. The position of my country is that we  the debtor countries  roust  whatever the cost  present a common front and avoid any disruption of our ranks in the face of the organized  united partners that harry us. Only such unity among the poor will enable us to secure if not the cancellation at least the suspension of payments.The tremendous achievements of science and technology have not been used for the economic and social development of mankind as a whole. How else can be explain the fact that on the eve of the twenty—first century millions of human beings throughout the world  particularly in Africa  Asia and Latin America  are still suffering and dying of ignorance  above all  and secondly of hunger  thirst and disease?Burkina Faso's revolutionary experience of the past two years has been and continues to be inspired by all past revolutions. He understand the misfortunes of all peoples throughout the world  without exception  and will continue to sympathize with them. Yet it is a new revolution in that it categorically rejects any servile imitation of others.Venturing on new paths to words of a better world  we have chosen to seek forms of organization that are better adapted to our civilization and that can bring out people closer to the other people? of the world in the search for the well-being and progress of all.The pursuit of this objective has been reflected in the mobilization  rational organization and collective discipline that our people have freely imposed on themselves in daring to bring about profound changes in their day-to-day economic  social and cultural life.For the past two years  under the leadership of the National Revolutionary Council  our people have made tremendous efforts in the main vital sectors of our society. I shall just mention two examples here.First  the ""vaccination commando"" made it possible to immunize  within 15 days  2.5 million children ranging in age from 9 months to 14 years  against measles  meningitis and yellow fever. The coverage was 106 per cent  showing that children from neighboring countries were also able to benefit.Secondly  thanks to the political determination to mobilize all energies in the democratic and revolutionary structures of the defense committees of the revolution  a city such as Ouagadougou  our capital  today has more than 150 wells providing drinking water to 20 sectors which were previously without this essential precision.We are happy to underscore the effective contribution made by the specialized agencies of the United Nations  specifically the world Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in our ""Commando Vaccination"" effort  and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for carrying out the drilling of wells and for other work relating to our infrastructure.We are not simply boasting of our achievements here. We are expressing a belief  one that we have developed over these past two years of revolutionary struggle. In Burkina Faso  positive developments and real achievements have proved that it is now possible to build a better world  so long as we are willing to think the unthinkable and to involve as many as possible in this endeavor.In our own daily struggles we also participate  in word and in deed  in the just and legitimate struggles of all peoples against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and racism - the main causes of the evils that are crippling all initiatives for a just and equitable peace throughout the world.This ongoing search for international peace and security remains the major imperative of our Organization on the eve of its fortieth anniversary.In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General quite rightly emphasized the role that each Member State must play in order to safeguard the mission of the United Nations: the maintenance of international peace and security.In the Security Council Burkina Faso has been working to the best of its ability and basing its participation on a firm defence of the principles of the Charter and the fundamental rights of peoples.Hence we endorse the Secretary-General's proposal to members of the Security Council to make this major body of the United Nations the true guardian of peace rather than an arena of confrontation between ideologies and policies that are at times totally irrelevant to the basic concerns of peoples. Going beyond the Security Council  we reaffirm the need to keep the united Nations as a whole free of bilateral controversy and make it once again the true forum for multilateralism.Fatherland or death  we will triumph."
"12",620,"BGD",40,1985,"The members of my delegation and I deem it an honor and privilege to take part in the fortieth regular session of the General Assembly  particularly in view of the fact that during this session we shall commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.Mr. President  may I extend to you the sincere felicitations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the high office of the Presidency of this session.Your great country has received wide appreciation for its peaceful  dynamic and constructive role in furthering the purposes and objectives of the United Nations Charter and for promoting peace  co-operation and development. We assure you of our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities. I also take this opportunity of extending our congratulations to other officers of the General Assembly on their well-deserved election.To our esteemed friend. Ambassador Paul Lusaka  we would like to express our deep appreciation for his valuable contribution as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His able and dynamic leadership  as well as his astute management of the business of the last session  have added yet another laurel to his long and distinguished career.We would also like to pay our compliments to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his total dedication in upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and his untiring and relentless efforts for strengthening the United Nations as an instrument for the promotion of world peace  security and development. His illuminating report (A/40/1) has evoked wide interest and acclaim and constitutes  in our view  a significant input to the deliberations of the current session of the General Assembly.I would also like to take this opportunity to express once again  on behalf of the Government and people of Bangladesh and on my own behalf  our profound grief at the toll in human and material terms claimed by the earthquakes which struck Mexico in the recent past. We express our solidarity with and support for the Government and the people of Mexico in their hour of national calamity and extend to them our profound admiration of the manner in which they have been able to tackle the after-effects of this calamitous misfortune  and especially their commendable efforts in minimizing suffering to the best of human ability.As we stand on the threshold of the commemorative session of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  we are in dire need ofdispelling anxieties and doubts of the divided present about the significance and relevance of this world body to contemporary international politics. The crisis of confidence through which the united Nations is now passing entails the necessity of reaffirming our total commitment to the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. The regeneration of our faith in the United Nations is the central task confronting the international community today  as we must and should realize that this world Organization constitutes an essential and integral element in the preservation of world peace  security and development.With the founding of the United Nations  mankind for the first time made a permanent institutional arrangement for co-operation and the resolution of conflicts among sovereign States. It is  therefore  inherent in the structure of world politics today that there is a symbiotic relationship between Member States and the united Nations  each reinforcing the other  and collectively promoting world peace and international co-operation and development.The United Nations Charter ushered in two fundamental changes in international relations. Firstly  it established a new concept of international morality based on peace and justice among nations. It is no longer force alone which dictates issues between nations; the disputed issues are appraised in the glare of world public opinion and scrutinized on their merits. Only half a century ago  the victors gloated over the vanquished in a vainglory of heroics: the modern-day warriors hurry to proclaim their commitment to peace.Secondly  the united Nations Charter does not stop at aiming at the creation of a simple instrument of peace  because the founding fathers of the United Nations were farsighted enough to see that an edifice of peace would crumble under the weight of economic and social injustice. They also realized that the war against hunger  disease  deprivation and illiteracy would have to be waged on a global basis through the concerted efforts of all nations. It is one of the boons of modern civilization that the world has been transformed into a global village; it is also a boon of contemporary history that man cannot live in the splendor of self-imposed isolation. Mother Earth has to be shared by both the rich and the poor. The word ""interdependence"" is no longer a just fashionable term; it is a practical key to the solution of many world problems.These are the perspectives in which Bangladesh views its own relations with the United Nations. Born in a bitter war of liberation  Bangladesh received an early apprenticeship in international co-operation in mitigating the sufferings of humanity from the ravages of the war. Our policy towards the United Nations stems from the will of the people of Bangladesh  who have seen the world body at work at close quarters since the days of the reconstruction of our war-torn economy. The United Nations is involved in the entire gamut of our nation-building activities  such as those concerned with agriculture and food  trade  shipping  industry  health  education  labor  environment  telecommunications  disaster relief and atomic energy  to name only a few.For our part  we try our very best to play our proper role in the United Nations. Bangladesh believes that it is an essential duty and responsibility of the international community to strengthen the United Nations. However imperfect the structure of this world body may be said to be  it has withstood the test of time and given the world 40 years of freedom from global conflict. It is true that Nations Charter merits consideration and reflection as regards ways of further increasing the effectiveness of the world Organization; nevertheless  its achievements so far are impressive indeed and have touched almost every aspect of progress in human civilization.Bangladesh is convinced that disarmament is a moral imperative in this nuclear age if the most important goal of the united Nations Charter  that is  the maintenance of international peace and security  is to be achieved.. It should be self-evident by now that the continued accumulation' of sophisticated  lethal weapons  particularly nuclear weapons  does not provide additional security. On the contrary  the arms race has further jeopardized international peace and security and even brought mankind close to the precipice of self-destruction. The situation clearly demands dialog and meaningful negotiations  and it in this context that we have expressed our satisfaction at the resumption of bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers in Geneva. It is our earnest hope that the summit meeting between them in November 1985 will have a favorable impact on global disarmament efforts and the lessening of world tension.It is now universally recognized that the question of disarmament  which has global dimensions and implications  can be addressed only in a multilateral context. The United Nations  therefore  has a central role and primary responsibility in halting and reversing the arms race with a view to achieving general and complete disarmament. The role and functions of the principal United Nations disarmament bodies  such as the Conference on Disarmament  the Disarmament Commission and the First Committee  should be reassessed with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations in this vital field. Bangladesh looks forward to playing an active role once it is admitted to the Conference on Disarmament.Bangladesh  in pursuance of its conviction that there can be no lasting world peace without the elimination and destruction of nuclear weapons and the stockpiles of then  acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons in 1979. We are  however  disappointed to note that nuclear proliferation  both vertical and horizontal  continues at a fast pace. The Third Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held very recently  discussed a number of key issues  and the recommendations adopted by that Conference should be examined carefully.Bangladesh has consistently emphasized that the colossal financial and other resources consumed by the arms race should be redirected to eliminate global poverty. The close relationship between disarmament and development is now universally recognized. In pursuance of the consensus resolution adopted last year  a preparatory committee met at the united Nations recently for the convening of an international conference on the subject. Bangladesh  one of the least developed countries  attaches particular importance to this question  and we have made sincere efforts to contribute to the discussions in the Preparatory Committee. It is our earnest hope that the General Assembly will fully support the early convening of an international conference on disarmament and development.The present explosive situation in the Middle East is a direct consequence of a historic injustice  when the Palestinian people were forcibly uprooted from their hearths and homes and an alien people was imposed on the Arab world through the creation of Israel. It is now universally recognized that the question of Palestine is at the core of the problem in the Middle East and that consequently it is not possible to bring peace to the region unless the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored.Bangladesh's position on this question has been firm and consistent and we have always extended our unequivocal support to our Palestinian brothers in their legitimate struggle for the restoration of their inalienable rights to self-determination  freedom and independence  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole  legitimate representative. We condemn the continued Israeli occupation of the Arab and Palestinian territories  as well as the establishment of the settlements on the occupied lands. The recent wanton Israeli attack on the PLO headquarters in Tunis is the latest manifestation of Israeli aggression. The Government and people of Bangladesh were outraged at this dastardly attack.As President Ershad has said ""This despicable act perpetrated against the peace-loving people of Tunisia and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) militates against all international norms of civilized conduct and amounts to a gross violation of the United Nations Charter"".It Is our fire conviction that the problems of the Middle East can be solved only by means of a comprehensive plan which must be based on the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Palestinian and Arab territories  including the Holy City of Al Quds Al Sharif  the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the participation of the PLO on an equal footing with all other parties. The Arab peace plan  which my delegation has supported as a sound and viable basis for the restoration of peace to the region  as well as other plans submitted by various quarters  is already before the international community. During the current session a decisive course of action should be embarked upon to initiate the peace process in the Middle East. The Secretary-General deserves our appreciation for his sincere and untiring efforts to restore peace in the region.The contribution of the United Nations in the field of decolonization is universally recognized and is demonstrated by the three-fold increase in its membership over the past four decades. It is therefore incumbent upon us all to do everything possible to remove the last vestige of colonialism  racism and apartheid in southern Africa. I should like to emphasize once again that the abhorrent practice of apartheid is not only contrary to the values of contemporary civilization but also to the tenets of all scriptures and religions  and that those who sustain and tolerate  directly or indirectly  the continuance of this abhorrent policy are placing an indelible blemish on the history of their own civilization and transgressing the laws of their own scriptures.Bangladesh  which so long suffered colonial subjugation and paid a heavy price for its independence  is irrevocably committed to the cause of the oppressed peoples of Namibia and South Africa in their just and legitimate struggle for freedom  liberty and human dignity. We will continue to take an active part in the United Rations Council for Namibia. Bangladesh would like to reiterate its firm conviction that the United Nations plan for Namibia as contained in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) is the only acceptable basis for a final and lasting settlement of the Namibian question and that it seeks nothing more than its full  unconditional and immediate implementation. We commend the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  for extending their full co-operation in the implementation of the United Nations plan. The racist Pretoria regime  on the other hand  has been obstructing implementation of the united Nations plan through its persistent attempts to link the independence of Namibia with extraneous and irrelevant issues. Worse still  the regime of late has intensified its efforts to impose an internal settlement in Namibia by promoting puppet political institutions. Bangladesh has condemned and rejected all these attempts in clear and categorical terms. Namibia has been the unique responsibility of the United Nations for the last two decades and the international community has a historic responsibility to protect the rights of the Namibian people. The current session should take concrete and effective measures to bring about the dawn of Namibian independence without any further delay.It is a matter of deep regret that  despite our collective efforts  the conflict between Iran and Iraq has been continuing for the last five years. This fratricidal war has not only brought in its train untold suffering  death and destruction to the people of both countries  but has also threatened regional and international peace and security. We take this historic opportunity to make yet another appeal to both Iran and Iraq favorably to consider the various peace initiatives and proposals which have been placed before them for a peaceful and honorable settlement of the conflict. Bangladesh  as a member of the Islamic Peace Committee  will continue to make every possible effort to put an end to this tragic conflict. At the same time  we believe that all ongoing efforts  both inside and outside the United Nations  must be intensified and  if necessary  co-ordinated action taken during the current session for a peaceful and honorable settlement of the conflict. We commend the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict and should like to assure him of our continued co-operation.Bangladesh is firmly and irrevocably committed to the Charter of the United Nations and to certain cardinal principles which must govern inter-State relations. We cannot condone the right of States to interfere or intervene in the internal affairs of other states  and we call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of other countries  except where such troops have been stationed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter - the Uniting for Peace resolution. It is in this context that we view the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea with grave concern. It is our firm conviction that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and Kampuchea is an essential prerequisite for the just and lasting settlement of the problems in those two countries. We are equally convinced that the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea should have restored to them their inalienable right to choose freely their own form of political  social and economic systems without any outside interference and intervention. It is regrettable that  although the General Assembly at its last session adopted comprehensive resolutions on those two issues  the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea are still denied their right to determine their own destiny because of the continued presence of foreign forces in their countries.It is a natter of deep regret that the question of Cyprus  which has been on the agenda of the United Nations for the last few decades  still remains unresolved. He are all conscious of the unfortunate events which have led to the present situation. Recent developments  however  should not be viewed in isolation from the overall question. Our position on the question of Cyprus has been firm and unequivocal. We have consistently supported the independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus. At the sane time we have reiterated our firm conviction that any lasting solution of the problem must take into account the legitimate aspirations of the two communities. It is in this context that we have urged both communities to engage in meaningful inter-communal talks. The resumption of direct high-level talks between the Cypriot leaders  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General at the beginning of the year  was indeed a positive development.My delegation will continue to extend its fullest co-operation to the Secretary-General in his good offices mission directed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution to the problem that would allow both communities to live in honor and dignity within the framework of a federal Cyprus.Bangladesh is convinced that regional and international peace and security would be promoted through the creation of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. In pursuance of that conviction  and as a littoral State  we have attached great importance to the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean region and have called for the early convening of a United Nations conference on the subject in Colombo. We have made sincere attempts to contribute to the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. Unfortunately  that Committee has not yet been able to achieve any meaningful progress at either the substantive or the organizational level. The deteriorating political and security climate in the region has made it more urgent to agree on the early convening of the conference. We also believe that the active participation of and full co-operation among littoral and hinterland States  the major maritime users  and the permanent members of the Security Council are essential for the successful convening of the Colombo Conference.Bangladesh's position on the Korea question has been consistent  and we firmly believe that peaceful and viable reunification can be successfully achieved only through dialog and negotiations between the two Koreas. We shall continue to support all such efforts towards that cherished end. We maintain friendly and cordial relations with both Koreas  and during the past year President Hussain Muhammad Ershad visited the Republic of Korea and had a fruitful exchange of views with the leaders of that country.The international community  and the united Nations in particular  has been concerning itself with the problem of international terrorism for some time now. While there is still no single international convention defining the rights and duties of States with regard to terrorism in an integral and comprehensive manner  there are quite a few which deal with specific aspects of terrorism. For instance  the General Assembly has adopted by consensus an international Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons  including Diplomatic Agents. In addition  the United Nations system has adopted a number of resolutions  declarations and recommendations  and taken other actions which together provide a legal framework for combating terrorism. The non-aligned countries which have been actively involved in drawing up legal instruments for combating terrorism have pointed out the need for the international community to come to grips with this abhorrent phenomenon. In this spirit we appeal to all countries in the world to co-operate with each other with a view to combating and preventing such acts of terrorism.As we meet here at the mid-point of the decade  it is logical and necessary for us to take stock of the achievements and deficiencies of the first part of the decade with respect to the fulfillment of our agreed commitments  and to initiate appropriate measures for the remainder of the decade directed to the realization of the Charter aim of promoting higher standards of living  full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development. The review and appraisal of the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade has  in spite of the delay  provided useful means for undertaking effective and concerted measures.The Mid-term Review Conference on the Implementation of the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries is now being held in Geneva. That blueprint for action was adopted with the aim of transforming the economies of the least developed countries into self-sustained development and enabling them to provide at least internationally accepted minimum standards of nutrition  health  transport and communications  housing and education  as well as job opportunities for all  particularly the rural and urban poor. Half-way through the decade  the realities of the situation in the least developed countries continues to be desperate: more than one third of the least developed countries' population is still seriously undernourished; less than one in three has access to a safe water supply; infant mortality is 10 times greater in least developed countries than in developed countries; two out of three adults  on average are illiterate; the per capita gross domestic product of the least developed countries is less than a quarter of the level for all developing countries as a group; the per capita gross domestic product in half of the least developed countries was lower in 1982 than at the start of the decade; and the decline in per capita food production in the least developed countries during the 1970s is continuing during the present decade.Depressing as it may sound  all these facts point towards one unfortunate conclusion - that there is little evidence of progress since the Paris Conference. Indeed  in some respects movement has been retrograde.While we remain conscious that in the least developed countries we have to intensify our own efforts - and we are gearing our efforts to that end - it remains our fervent expectation that these efforts will receive the sympathetic understanding of the international community and will be complemented by adequateand effective support from the international community  in particular the donor countries. My delegation eagerly looks forward to the success of the Mid-term Review in Geneva.It is a well-accepted reality that no country or group of countries can function in isolation or outside the framework of the international economic setting. To my mind  the fundamental message of this year's world Development Report published by the World Bank  the World Economic Survey published by the United Nations  and the Report of the United Nations Committee for Development Planning  is the reiteration of the growing interdependence of the global economy  on the one hand  and the interrelated nature of issues relating to money  finance and trade  on the other. That is what we have been saying all along  and it reaffirms our conviction that all of us must take the global view of developments and consider actions to be taken from a global perspective.But events during the last 10 years  particularly during the first half of this decade  have also shown that interdependence can have dual implications. On the one hand  it can help countries adjust to external shocks and on the other it can also serve as an additional channel for the transmission of those shocks. The latter had a particularly devastating impact on the developing countries during the 1981-83 recession  which was also by an unfortunate coincidence the worst in post-war history. The vast majority of the developing countries are still reeling under the impact of this recession. Although this is the third year of the much-heralded recovery  the problems of the majority of developing countries remain as acute as ever. In 1984  no less than 44 developing countries experienced a stagnating or declining real per capita output  many of them for the fourth consecutive year. Even though world trade revived in 1984 commodity prices during the same period were still some 15 to 20 per cent below the level of 1980. The impact of this persistent weakness in commodity prices can be gaged when we consider that export earnings from primary commodities constitute the dominant share for at least 72 developing countries. I need hardly add that a vast number of them belong to the least developed category.The very welcome recovery of the United States economy has shown distinct signs of leveling off. In most of Europe  the recovery has yet to gain a firm foothold. While we welcome the determination of the United States authorities to deal with the problem of the budget deficit  uncertainties with regard to exchange rate fluctuations  high real rates of inflation and the volatility of the current account deficit  particularly of the most powerful economies  continue to haunt the world economy. Even worse  the cumulative effects of these uncertainties have increased pressure towards rising protectionism. This is a danger about which all of us  irrespective of our level of development or social system  must consciously guard against  and we must act together to institute recovery on a firm and lasting basis.This brings me to the much discussed proposal for a new round of trade negotiations. But what good would such trade talks be to us in the developing world unless there is an adequate guarantee that they will reflect our aspirations? How can we develop confidence in the beneficial outcome of such trade talks if past commitments for the establishment of a more open trading system and for the liberalization of trade barriers are not fulfilled and solid groundwork laid for the initiation of a new round? As developing countries  we naturally feel apprehensive when we find that even existing concessions extended to us  such as those through the multi-fibre arrangements  are being eroded. My delegation sincerely hopes that through discussion we can find a mutually satisfactory solution which will address our genuine concerns and apprehensions.I referred earlier to the interrelated nature of world economic issues  particularly those related to tirade  money and finance. This interrelatedness has been fundamental in the concept of global negotiations. In our opinion  in adopting resolution 34/138 by consensus in this Assembly  the international community acknowledged this principle. My delegation is encouraged to note that greater consideration is being given to the interrelated nature of issues  particularly concerning trade  money and finance in various relevant forums  including multilateral financial institutions. Yet  unfortunately  so far there has been very little action.The debt problem is often considered a problem of the higher income developing countries. This is not necessarily so. For instance  between 1978 and 1982  the total outstanding medium- and long-term external debt of the least developed countries grew by 68 per cent and their debt service payment increased by 73 per cent during the same period. In absolute terms  their total debt may not be as large as sane of the higher income developing countries  but in terms of impact on their fragile economies  their situation is certainly comparable. Indeed  it could be worse because of their inability to absorb shock. Let me just point out that matters became worse after the adoption of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) resolution 165 (S-IX) aimed at reducing their external debt difficulties.The crunch is evident from what I have described just now. Yet during the same period resource flows for development in the developing countries dwindled. Total resource flows to the developing countries  including concessional flows  fell in 1984 as compared to 1985. There was a decline in official development assistance  in commercial bank lending  in foreign direct investment and export credit. The level of overall commitments to the least developed countries fell to $8.5 billion in 1982 from its peak of $10.3 billion in 1980.How can we then expect developing countries to join in the process of recovery and development? Drought related food emergencies exist in at least 20 sub-Saharan African countries. Nearly 30 million people on the African continent face hunger and starvation. Famine conditions and the aftermath of famine in many of these countries pose new challenges for the international community. Although as a region Asia has done relatively better  four-fifths of the total population of that region still live in countries categorized as low income countries and the largest concentration of humanity living below the level of absolute poverty continues to live in that region.I should like to commend in this connection the useful and effective contribution of the United Nations system to the promotion of co-operation  in particular its contribution through operational activities for development. Thecontribution of agencies and bodies  such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and many others  in improving the quality of life in the developing countries are particularly noteworthy.The essential point is that there is no alternative to international co-operation and much core can be achieved if the international environment is congenial to such co-operation. One need only mention how significantly the development process in the developing countries was accelerated during the periods of global economic stability in the 1950s and 1960s. Given this perspective  which we believe is shared by all of us assembled here  it is the earnest hope of my delegation that in this important year commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations an agreement on a global agenda can be reached and effectively followed to put the international community  and more specifically the developing countries  solidly on the course of sustained development again.In this context  my delegation's sincere expectation is that immediate and effective action can be undertaken on the following: first  accelerated implementation of the Substantial New Program of Action in favor of the least developed countries  as well as full implementation of resolution 165 (S-IX) of the Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNGFAD); secondly  support for drought-affected people in Africa; thirdly  comprehensive and effective measures for increasing financial flows to developing countries  in particular concessional assistance to the least developed countries; fourthly  the rollback of protectionism and strengthening of the world trading system through full implementation of all previous commitments  which will also create conditions for initiating a new round of multilateral trade negotiations  which no doubt will have to be in keeping with the aspirations of the developing countries; and fifthly  the convening of an international conference on monetary and financial issues to consider appropriate reforms aimed at providing greater stability and a momentum for development.The present global economic situation has added an important dimension to economic co-operation among developing countries  not as a substitute for but as complementary to North-South co-operation. We believe that such co-operation can effectively promote rational and efficient use of human  material  financial and technological resources not only for developing countries but also for global development. The United Nations system should  however  intensify its support for programs of economic co-operation among developing countries and integrate them into the mainstream of its activities. Bangladesh's commitment to that economic co-operation as well as regional co-operation has found practical expression in our efforts towards the establishment of South Asian regional co-operation arrangements among seven countries of the regions India  Pakistan  Sri Lanka  Nepal  Bhutan  Maldives and Bangladesh  whose Heads of State and Government are meeting at their first ever summit conference on 7 and 8 December this year in Dhaka. South Asian Regional Co-operation has already  in the meantime  adopted an integrated program of action in which nine areas have so far been identified for the purposes of co-operation. These are: agriculture  rural development  telecommunications  health and population control  transport  postal services  scientific and technological co-operation  meteorology  and sport  arts and culture.In this connection  I should like to inform the Assembly briefly about developments in my country. Soon after assuming its responsibilities  the present Government  under the leadership of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad  initiated some drastic reforms covering the entire gamut of national life. The reforming steps taken by the present Government include economic reform aimed at eliminating waste  boosting production and giving maximum encouragement to the development of the private sectors The most spectacular of the reform measures  however  have been administrative reforms  based on the principles of decentralization and devolution of power to the common people  and judicial reforms  also based on the principle of decentralization. Under the new system  administration has been taken Eight to the doors of the country's vast rural population. Grass-root units have now become the focal point of all local activities. This means that through these units  known as upazilas  tine vast rural population of Bangladesh will now have full power and control in deciding their own affairs themselves.In this is context  in the national referendum held in March this year the people of Bangladesh expressed their overwhelming support for the policies and programs of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.In May and June 1985  when the people of my country had just begun to enjoy the fruits of decentralization of administration  a devastating cyclone  accompanied by a tidal wave and floods  struck Bangladesh  causing enormous losses in terms of human life and widespread destruction of agricultural land  crops  poultry  livestock and other assets. The Government  under the personal direction of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad  took all possible steps to alleviate the sufferings of the people by prompt and energetic measures of relief;  rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected areas. The crisis management by which the Government mitigated the losses was widely acclaimed. I should like to say in this context that even though we did not appeal for any international assistance  friendly States and the United Nations agencies came forward with generous assistance to stand by us in this hour of need. At the instance of the Secretary-General  the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator  Ambassador M'haroed Essaafi  visited Bangladesh and submitted his report  suggesting various ways of co-operation between the Government of Bangladesh and international agencies.In this connection  I would draw the international community's attention to my country's vulnerability to frequent natural disasters  such as floods  cyclones and tidal waves  with their adverse consequences for the economic development of the country; they also cause enormous losses in terms of lives and property. The Government of Bangladesh seeks to find a permanent solution to the problem of natural disasters and would welcome effective international programs for rendering the necessary assistance to Bangladesh in this matter. A draft resolution on this will soon come before the General Assembly for consideration. We express in advance our thanks to those who have shown valuable support and understanding for our proposal.My delegation attaches the greatest importance to a global consensus an international co-operation for development and  as always  we are ready to contribute in whatever manner possible to the realization of this noble objective  for the alternative to international co-operation is arbitrariness  instability and disorder. We sincerely hope that we can muster the courage and determination to reinvigorate the global consensus for development.While commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  we pay homage to the sacrifices of the martyrs of the two World Wars  sacrifices which have not been in vain. Though it is not the world of the dreams of Jean Monnet or of Woodrow Wilson  with his dream of the League of Nations ending all wars  or of the dream of Paul Valéry  with his hope not only of the League of Nations but also of the league of minds  still the dream goes on. After 40 years it seems more reasonable now than it was at the end of the last world war."
"13",666,"BGR",40,1985,"I congratulate the President cordially on his election to the important post of President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and I wish him success in his responsible work.At the beginning of my statement I would like to convey the sincere condolences of the Bulgarian people to the people of Mexico for the natural disaster which has resulted in loss of life and has inflicted heavy material damage.Our Organization stands on the threshold of its fortieth anniversary. Born in the course of the historic common struggle against German fascism and Japanese militarism  it emerged as the expression of the common resolve of nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to unite their strength to maintain international peace and security. The progressive and democratic purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are of enduring importance. They include the maintenance of peace  co-operation  equality of peoples and their right to self-determination  prohibition of the use of force and the threat of force  respect for territorial integrity  the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  and so on. These principles embody the idea of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems and are the very core of universally recognized norms of international law. Unfailing adherence to them is the true path to a peaceful future and the progress of mankind.We note with satisfaction that the United Nations has stood the test of time. Over the course of its existence it has made a substantial contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and security  of furthering co-operation and promoting friendly relations among nations. The United Nations has become the natural forum for the discussion of the most important political  economic  social and other problems of the world today and for seeking solutions to them. At the same time  it is obvious that the United Nations has far from exhausted its potential. It can and must play an even greater role in international affairs. An important precondition for the attainment of this goal is strict and unswerving observance of the Charter of the United Nations and the implementation of the decisions adopted in accordance with its provisions.History is a great teacher and makes it imperative for us today   40 years after the end of the Second World War  not only to remember the bitter experience of it  but also to learn clear lessons for the future. Co-operation within the anti-Hitlerite coalition was a good example of how States with different social systems can  in spite of the ideological and political differences between them  act together in the name of a common goal  namely  that of ensuring lasting peace on earth.Today  this goal is even more urgent. Mankind is threatened with extinction. This could be the only possible result of a nuclear catastrophe.The United Nations approaches its anniversary in a tense international situation. The acceleration of the arms race and actions which lead to its possible spreading into outer space  the policy of attaining world supremacy  gross interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States  the raising of obstacles to the peaceful settlement of conflicts - all of this is leading to a sharp increase in the danger of nuclear war.The military-industrial complex is spending vast sums of money on the development and stockpiling of new types of weapons  including space weapons  for the purpose of gaining military superiority over the socialist countries. The experience of history confirms  however  that this exercise is a futile one. This has been true in the past and is even more certain in today's circumstances. Military strategic parity will unquestionably be maintained  although at the cost of raising the level of armaments and increasing the threat of war.For four decades now the undying echo of the nuclear explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been appealing to the conscience and common sense of mankind to take resolute measures for the limitation and reduction of nuclear arms until they have been totally and finally eliminated. Today  the question we face is this: either mankind destroys nuclear weapons  or nuclear weapons will destroy mankind.We are firmly convinced that the strengthening of peace and international security  the curbing of the arms race  the limitation and reduction of armaments  the lowering of the level of military confrontation  can only be achieved through constructive negotiations aimed at producing effective and mutually acceptable agreements based on the principles of equality and equal security. This is the basis on which all negotiations should be conducted  whether in Geneva or in Vienna  Stockholm  and indeed at all international forums.The world today needs the concerted and honest efforts of all States and social forces in order to halt the juggernaut of the arms race and to put into effect the practical measures designed to improve the international situation and to restore detente.In our view  this imperative is paramount today.Taking into consideration the crucial role of the relations between the USSR and the United States the overall state of the political situation in the world  the People's Republic of Bulgaria welcomes the forthcoming summit meeting between the leaders of the two countries. We express the hope that at that meeting agreements will be reached which will contribute to the revival and consolidation of trust and mutual understanding.My country attaches primary importance to the disarmament talks between the USSR and the United States. The new Soviet-American talks in Geneva have given rise to hopes that effective solutions will be found for the whole complex of issues concerning space and nuclear weapons. Strict adherence to the agreement reached on the subject and goals of the negotiations is a prerequisite for their successful conclusion. In order to contribute to achieving success at those negotiations  the USSR suspended the deployment of medium-range missiles and the introduction of other retaliatory measures in Europe until November this year. Regrettably  however  the actions of the American side so far have raised serious doubts abouts its willingness for and interest in achieving positive results. Not only has there been no readiness to give up the so-called Strategic Defense Initiative  but work on that project has been speed up. The development  production  testing and deployment of space strike weapons will make impossible the limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons and will  on the whole  accelerate the pace of the arms race in all areas and increase the danger of nuclear war.The question of preventing an arms race in outer space has literally become decisive for the fate of mankind. The acid test of realism or adventurism in the approach to resolving the key issues of peace and war is precisely the attitude adopted towards that question.In the face of the growing threat  the Soviet Union has taken an important step. It has proposed the inclusion in the agenda of the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations an item entitled ""International co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space in conditions of its non-militarization"". The response of the United States was the first military testing of an anti-satellite weapon. It is worth recalling that in August 1983 the USSR announced its decision not be the first to launch an anti-satellite weapon in outer space.A new  decisive and bold step by the USSR was its unilateral suspension of all nuclear explosions and its call upon the United States side to follow its example. Testimony to the exceptional significance and timeliness of the Soviet moratorium is the considerable response with which it has been met throughout the world. An opportunity appeared for the joint implementation of a concrete and effective measure aimed at curbing the nuclear-arms race. Once again  however  the answer was a peculiar one of further nuclear explosions.I think that the contrast between the actions of the two sides is evident. Constructive initiatives and concrete actions  rather than empty statements of good intentions and peaceableness  are needed for the removal of the nuclear peril. It is precisely at such concrete actions that the proposals of the USSR and the other Socialist countries are directed. Included among them are the initiatives for the assumption by all nuclear-weapon States of the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  for a nuclear-weapon freeze  for a total ban on the testing of such weapons and for nuclear disarmament.The People's Republic of Bulgaria reaffirms the position of the socialist countries that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of Europe and in other parts of the world would greatly contribute to lessening the nuclear danger. It is within this context that one should also consider our efforts for turning the Balkan peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.The achievement of positive results on the other disarmament issues as well is of great importance for curbing the dangerous and ruinous arms race. He are convinced that with good will and persistent efforts by all States a total ban on chemical  radiological and a number of other weapons could be achieved. The proposal that the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic made to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the establishment of a chemical-weapon-free zone in Europe is yet another example of the presence of such good will on the part of the socialist countries. However  such actions as the decision to manufacture binary chemical weapons  coupled with plans for their deployment in Europe  raise most serious obstacles to the reaching of an agreement on this question.Measures must also be taken to limit and reduce conventional armaments. A matter of serious concern is the escalating race in naval armaments and the increased naval presence and activities which directly endanger the security of many countries  peaceful navigation and the exploitation of the world's oceans. It is our firm conviction that the time has come for honest  businesslike and constructive talks which could lead to the concluding of mutually acceptable agreements. On this basis  Bulgaria will again submit a draft resolution on this question at the current session.We can state with satisfaction that the overwhelming majority of States in the world resolutely oppose the arms race and the growing threat of war and are sincerely striving for lasting peace.The People's Republic of Bulgaria highly appreciates the contribution of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to the cause of maintaining peace  of ending the arms race and of achieving disarmament. Bulgaria's positive attitude towards the Joint Declaration of the six Heads of State and Government is yet another confirmation of our readiness to strengthen our co-operation and unity of action with all countries in the struggle for peace and disarmament.Another positive factor is the growing involvement of the broadest circles of. the international community in questions of peace and disarmament. Their will has become a factor which can no longer be disregarded in establishing the policies of States on these vitally important questions.The mobilization of world public opinion in support of disarmament efforts has become an important part of United Nations activities. The People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the World Disarmament Campaign.When speaking of disarmament questions  we must stress that in no circumstances must we allow the positive results achieved in the 1960s and 1970s to be undermined. It is in the interests of all countries that those results should be reaffirmed and strengthened. A positive example of this was the recent Review Conference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty.The elimination of hotbeds of tension and conflict in various parts of the world is also of vital importance to peace  together with the struggle to avert the nuclear threat. It must be noted that certain imperialist circles  for the sake of their selfish strategic goals  continue to flout the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and independence  interfere flagrantly in the internal affairs of sovereign States  resort to political pressure and economic blackmail  and employ the methods of State terrorism. Striking examples are the aggressive actions against Nicaragua  the threats against Cuba  and the armed interventions in the affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. It would be in the security interest of all countries for such policies and practices in relations among States be halted forthwith.Particularly dangerous for international peace are the hotbeds of tension and conflict which for so many years have been smoldering or actually flaring up one after another  taking their toll of innocent life. This applies  first and foremost  to the conflict in the Middle East. The situation in that region continues to be explosive. Encouraged by its ""strategic ally""  Israel has not ceased its aggressive actions against Lebanon  as well as against the Palestinian people  and continues its illegal occupation of Arab territories. In our opinion  a just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be brought about only through the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including their right to establish an independent State  and the guaranteeing of the right of all countries in the region to exist in conditions of peace and security. Such a peace can be achieved only through collective efforts within the framework of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.There must also be an end to the war between Iran and Iraq  and the controversial issues existing between the two countries must be settled through negotiations.It is becoming increasingly urgent to find a peaceful and just solution to the Cyprus problem by ensuring the independence  sovereignty  unity  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus  the withdrawal of all foreign forces  and the dismantling of foreign military bases  while respecting the interests of both the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.The unabating tension in Central America continues to cause serious concern. There is a growing threat of open military intervention against Nicaragua. We support the proposals of the Sandinista Government and their readiness for talks with the United States of America  as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to find a political solution to the conflict without outside interference.Bulgaria supports the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of foreign forces from South Korea and the peaceful  democratic unification of that country.The present tense international situation requires even more active efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations as an effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. Fifteen years after its adoption  the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security continues to point to the right way to undertake concerted efforts to establish an effective system of collective security.Many regional proposals have created considerable opportunities for the strengthening of international security. In Europe  through the collective efforts of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation  the groundwork has been laid for detente  which has demonstrated its indisputable advantages and benefits for all. The tenth anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki confirmed its viability and its great importance for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of co-operation in Europe. The conclusion of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe with meaningful results would make a substantial contribution to the cause of detente on the continent and throughout the world. A good basis for this are the proposals put forward by the socialist countries  such as those for the conclusion of a treaty embodying a mutual agreement on the non-use of military force  for the conducting of negotiations on freezing and reduction of military expenditure  and so forth.Objective conditions exist for the strengthening of security in Asia. The basis for this has been laid by the USSR proposal for the working out of a joint comprehensive approach to the security problems of that continent. Equally topical now are the proposals of the IndoChina countries designed to enhance stability and co-operation in South-East Asia  the proposals by the Mongolian People's Republic* the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  India and other States of the region. The implementation of those proposals  and of the idea of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  is in keeping with the interests not only of the people of Asia but of all peoples in the world.The United Nations should complete its work of eradicating colonialism. The twenty-fifth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples should serve as an incentive for resolute action to terminate the illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist regime of South Africa  grant independence to the Namibian people and eliminate the last vestiges of colonialism. We support the just struggle of the Namibian people for freedom and independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and call for the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We categorically condemn the aggressive actions of South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola and other States in that region.The latest events in South Africa unequivocally reveal the profound crisis gripping the Pretoria regime - one which  with the support of its protectors  survives only through terror and violences It is high time that the criminal system of apartheid in South Africa was ended. categorically condemn this policy and vigorously call for the imposition by the United Nations of mandatory sanctions against South Africa.Tensions in the political area are also accompanied by the intensification of negative processes in the sphere of international economic relations. Fundamental principles of international economic co-operation are being increasingly violated. Sanctions  blackmail  threats  diktat  embargoes  trade restrictions  and so on  are being used for essentially political purposes. The question of restoring confidence in international relations  including international economic relations  and of solving existing grave economic  financial and social problems in the developing countries has now become an urgent matter.The People's Republic of Bulgaria views with understanding the problems of developing countries that are struggling for economic independence. The causes of the serious difficulties they continue to encounter are rooted in the colonial past of these countries  in the continuing dependence of their economies and the neo-colonial exploitation of their material and human resources. The developing countries have been adversely affected by the ""open door"" policy to foreign capital forced upon them by the developed capitalist States and their monopolies  as as by the practice of protectionism and restrictions and the attempts to exploit the difficulties of the developing countries for the purpose of their economic and financial enslavement. The intensifying of neo-colonial exploitation has been most strikingly demonstrated in the sphere of international financial and credit relations. The problem of foreign debt has emerged in recent years as one of the main destabilizing factors within the system of international monetary and financial relations of capitalism. This grave and pressing problem can and must be solved by means of a radical restructuring of the system itself.My country has repeatedly expressed its support foe the basic documents of the United Nations relating to the establishment of a new international economic order. Together with the other member States of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  Bulgaria has been unremitting in its efforts to promote equitable and mutually advantageous economic  scientific and technological co-operation in relations between East and West  as well as with all States  including developing countries.The People's Republic of Bulgaria has made a worthy contribution to United Nations activities designed to foster broad international co-operation in the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Bulgaria has also contributed to the accomplishments of the United Nations in the social area  including the holding of the International Youth Year and the United Nations Decade for Women.At the same time we consider that even more active and resolute action is necessary for the elimination of the mass and flagrant violations of human rights in various parts of the world.In conclusion I should like to stress that the solving of global problems  such as the elimination of economic underdevelopment  hunger  poverty  disease  illiteracy and others  is closely related to the strengthening of peace and security and to the cessation of the arms race  something that would release vast resources for improving the living conditions of every individual and the whole of mankind.December of this year will mark the thirtieth anniversary of the admission of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to membership of the United Nations. For us this is an occasion once again to state that our country  together with the other countries of the socialist community  will continue to pursue an active and consistent policy designed to strengthen international peace and security and to further co-operation in the Balkans- in Europe and in the entire world.This policy of ours was recently reaffirmed by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkov  who stated:""We have pointed cut on many occasions that  given the existence of opposing social systems  the only sensible basis for building international relations are the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems. We support the efforts of all those who are seeking and are prepared to seek ways of removing the threat of nuclear war and ways of expanding international co-operation in the interests of all peoples on Earth.""

"14",711,"BHR",40,1985,"Mr. President  in the name of His Highness Shaikh Isa bin Saimawn Al-Khalifa  The Emir of the State of Bahrain  it gives m .pleasure at the outset to congratulate Mr. De Pinies on his election as President of the General Assembly at this historic session  which coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. I should like to pay tribute to his friendly country Spain  for its contribution to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations  and for the close friendship existing between our two countries. I wish him all success in c carrying out the work of this session.I should not fail to express my deep respect to the President of the General Assembly at the last session  Mr. Paul Lusaka  for his success in conducting the work of that session. I also pay my respects to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his unremitting efforts to create an international atmosphere more favorable to international co-operation in a world in which security  justice and peace prevail.The fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations distinguishes this session from former sessions. The United Nations  during the forty years of its existence  scored brilliant successes and failed dismally in other respects. These failures were due to the negative attitude of some States  which has led to the weakening of the role of this Organization. Nevertheless  the need to keep the United Nations in existence and strengthen its role is unavoidable.Consequently  the international community should take this historic opportunity to study and define the reasons which prevented our international Organization from implementing many of its principles and goals.It has become clear that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of world peace and security is weakening  due to the tension and conflict existing in the relations between the super-Powers.As a result of the need to keep our international Organization in existence  on the one hand  and the fact that its role has been weakened in recent years on the other  we should evaluate the role of the United Nations  its accomplishments  and the extent to which it has been able to implement the goals and principles of the Charter.We  in Bahrain  believe in the importance of the role of the United Nations  and always reaffirm the need to develop its organs  so that it may be able to deal with international problems and find appropriate solutions to them. Our belief is based on the firm conviction that all nations of the world adhere to the goals and principles contained in the United Nations Charter  and that no State or small group of States  however much may be its resources and capabilities  can by itself alone deal with the grave problems confronting the world of today. The problems of peace  security  the arms race  poverty  famine  pollution  unemployment and other matters need collective efforts for their solution. The role of the United Nations should therefore be strengthened and developed to cope with such matters.Our concern for the United Nations should not be confined only to keeping the Organization in existence. To cope with the current political  economic and human conditions  this important Organization should be developed  and its efficiency and power strengthened. It is regrettable that collective efforts have not been made during the last forty years to develop the organs of this international Organization  due to the cold war between East and West  which has resulted in weakening the role of the United Nations in dealing with international questions.Due to the universal nature and gravity of the problems confronting humanity  we have to appeal to the international community to intensify its efforts to implement the goals and principles of the United Nations  and develop the powers of our Organization  so that it may be able to deal with such international problems.The continuation of the cold war between the two super-Powers has created state blocs  which weaken collective International co-operation. In recent years  a new trend appears among some States to blame the United Nations for the conflict between the two super-Powers and the alignment of some States in the third world to either of them.The reason for the non-implementation of the principles and goals of the United Nations is primarily the failure of some great Powers to abide by their obligations under the Charter  and their recurrent use of the veto in the Security Council to promote their own private interests  and those of States allied to them  against the interests of the world community as a whole. In so doing  they do not heed the resultant loss of confidence in the ability of the Organization to implement its principles and resolutions.In this connection  Israel is the best example of that. Since its establishment on the Arab land of Palestine to this day  it has not stopped its aggression against the people of Palestine and the Arab States  the latest manifestation of which has been the savage attack on our sister country of Tunisia  and its disregard for United Nations resolutions on the Palestine question and the problems of the Middle East. Nevertheless  neither the Security Council nor the international community has been able to stop its recurrent aggression or impose against it the sanctions provided for in the Charter.The criticism launched against the United Nations should not make us forget that it has been able during the past forty years to score many successes. In the field of decolonization  the United Nations assisted many people of the world to obtain their independence  in accordance with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960. During thelast forty years  hundreds of millions of people have been able to obtain their freedom and independence through the effective role played by the United Nations in the field of decolonization. Consequently  the member ship of the international Organization has increased from 51 members in 1945 to 159 today. It has thereby attained one of its main objectives  namely  universality.The Organization has also made important achievements by providing technical aid through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and specialized agencies. The United Nations allocates nearly US $2.6 billion every year for economic development. In the human and social fields  the United Nations provides much aid through the united Nations Children's Fund (UNIGBF) to the children of the world  particularly in Asia  Africa and Latin America.The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) tries also to save the lives of forty thousand children who die every day in the world. The General Assembly had already adopted a resolution calling for the reduction of the rate of death among children to 50 in a thousand in all parts of the world by the beginning of the twenty-first century.In the field of human aid  Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees provides aid to tens of millions of refugees  in addition to humanitarian aid to tens of millions of people in Africa who suffer from the ravages of drought.The United Nations also encouraged the observance of human rights. The General Assembly adopted in December 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration has become an historic document which entitles the international community to look after human rights in all parts of the world.The Organization has also helped in the codification and development of international law. The International Law Commission was established in 1947. The United Nations scored great success in this field by sponsoring many multilateral treaties dealing with vital subjects such as the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  outer space  health  trade  development  educational matters  freedom of the press  disarmament  environment  telecommunications.The most important achievement of the United Nations in recent years perhaps was the preparation for the conclusion of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Member states of the Organization have been able  after exhausting attempts lasting almost 10 years  to lay down a comprehensive Convention on the Law on the Sea.United Nations peace-keeping operations have proved to be the means for the settlement of many international disputes arising from regional conflicts  particularly as the principle of collective security has become unattainable  due to the differences existing among the great Powers. The Charter has laid down definite procedures for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  and definite measures for the use of collective armed force against any aggressor State or States. The current tension in international relations  however  makes it difficult for the Security Council to apply the provisions of the Charter to prevent aggression or deter the aggressor.It was therefore necessary to find new means compatible with the goals of the Charter. Thus  there came out the idea of keeping peace by formation of peace-keeping forces  which intervened  more or less successfully  in Indonesia  Palestine  Kashmir  Korea  the Congo  Cyprus  Sinai  the Golan Heights  South Lebanon and other regions which witnessed serious conflicts or disturbances. Although such operations were important to maintain peace and security in such hotbeds of tension  the United Nations could not settle a great number of international disputes and conflicts due to its inability to a great extent to execute its decisions. The Charter has given the Security Council the necessary power of execution to maintain world peace. Therefore  it is difficult to carry out the duty to maintain peace and security for everyone in the world  unless the great Powers can settle their chronic differences  or at least attempt to establish constructive working relations among them.It has been clear from the experience of the last 40 years that the Security Council  which is invested with the power to maintain peace and security  could not settle serious political disputes in the world  because of the conflict in interests of its permanent members  as some of them would side openly with parties violating the principles of the Charter. Thus  important disputes  such as the questions of Palestine  Namibia  racial discrimination and Afghanistan  remain unsettled.For the sake of historical comparison  we may recall that many political disputes were submitted to the League of Nations after its establishment in 1920. The League found solutions to some of those disputes  but failed to settle roost of the important ones. In the end  the League collapsed as an international organization and the Second world War commenced and involved the world in violence  disorder and instability.Let us now renew our determination to strengthen the role of the United Nations  so that it may remain an important platform for dialog and understanding among nations and peoples  and provide a good framework for co-operation and settlement of disputes  in order to maintain world peace and security and spare future generations from the scourge of war.The Iraq-Iran war has entered its sixth year. Its danger and scope have been so extended as to endanger navigation in the whole of the Gulf region. Commercial ships have been attacked outside the zone of military operations  although they belong to States not parties to the dispute. The Security Council adopted resolutions 540 (1983) and 552 (1984)  which reaffirm the principle of freedom of navigation in that vital region of the world. They call upon all States to refrain from any act that may obstruct freedom of navigation in the Gulf to and from the ports of States which are not parties to the dispute.A dangerous development took place in this war when Iran started detaining in its ports commercial ships belonging to States not parties to the dispute. Such acts aggravate the dangers of the war  threaten international navigation and undermine the relations of good neighborliness.- The Iraq-Iran war has become  without any doubt  a source of concern and instability in the Gulf region. Moved by the need for peaceful co-existence among all States of the region and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  the countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council of Arab States deployed and exerted tireless efforts to settle the dispute between the neighboring States of Iran and Iraq  and called upon the two warring States to apply the dictates of logic and justice and accept its own mediation or that of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference or others.It is worth noting that Iraq has responded to all initiatives to settle this dispute peacefully through negotiations. Moved by the desire to safeguard the security  peace and stability of the people of the two countries  we sincerely hope that Iran will respond to the peaceful initiatives and mediations  so that peace may return to the countries of that region.The international community as a whole is called upon to move to contain this destructive war and settle it peacefully. The international community can no longer ignore this dangerous war  which has started to threaten the peace and security of the Gulf as a whole  and endanger the interests thereby of other States lying far from the region.The question of Palestine is one of the chronic problems that the United Nations has been dealing with  since it was laid before the General Assembly by Great Britain on the grounds that it was unable to solve that problem. The General Assembly adopted the well-known partition resolution in 1947  in which some Western States and other States from the Eastern bloc played an effective role in its drafting and adoption. It was under that resolution that the Zionist entity was established on the Arab land of Palestine.Ever since that date  Israel started to carry out its expansionist policy. It still occupies all the land of Palestine  to build unlawful Zionist settlements. It attacks continuously the neighboring Arab States and occupies by force their territories  as happened in 1982 when its forces attacked Lebanon. It still . subjects the Arab inhabitants to the most severe kinds of injustice  murder and dispossession and applies against them the same terrorist and racial measures -used by the Government of Pretoria against the people of South Africa.The failure of the Security Council to implement its decisions has encouraged Israel to persist in its challenge to this Organization. It persists in attacking any Arab State and violating the integrity of its territories or air space. In June 1981  its aircrafts attacked the Iraqi nuclear reactor built for peaceful purposes. Last week  it launched an air raid against the sister country of Tunisia  and inflicted heavy losses in life and property among the civilian population.This criminal attack by Israel is an overt terrorist act  and a grave violation of the sovereignty and security of a State Member of this Organization. It is a serious disregard of all principles and goals advocated by the United Nations Charter and international law. We appeal to the international community to condemn this criminal aggression committed by an entity which pretends to be a State abiding by international law  whereas in fact it is far from being so.The Security Council has not been able to adopt resolutions to prevent or stop recurrent Israeli aggression  or to implement positive decisions adopted by it to reaffirm the illegality of the annexation of Arab land  due to the support of the United States to Israel and its recurrent use of the veto against any proposal to condemn or punish Israel for its inhuman practices  which are contrary to international law. The prestige of this Organization cannot be restored except by due respect for its resolutions.Despite the arrogance of Israel and its continuous aggression  the Arabs have proved to the world that they want peace. They exposed the fraudulent allegations of Israel when they put forward the Fez Plan for peace in the Middle East. It is a positive plan  which has been rejected by Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  which is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has responded to the initiatives for a peaceful solution by participating in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to carry out a dialog with the United States in preparation for an international conference to solve the Palestinian question peacefully.Anybody who reads through Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) will find that they are based on the sound principle of peace for land. All initiatives for peace in this respect are based on this principle. Thus we see that the Arab nation is moving towards peace  whereas Israel is blocking this forward movement  for it does not want peace. It prefers the occupation of Arab lands to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region.The question of apartheid has been under discussion by the General Assembly since 1946. It is regrettable that the international community has so far been unable until now to stop the inhuman practices of the white minority regime directed against the people of South Africa.The question of apartheid has given rise to a number of decisions at the international level; possibly the most important is the Security Council resolution of 4 November 1977 which^ under Chapter VII of the Charter  made mandatory the then voluntary ban on the export of arms to South Africa. The racist Pretoria Government tries to contain international pressure by introducing formal reforms which do not deal with the actual policy of racial discrimination in South Africa. This action has not deceived the international community which has  on the contrary  reaffirmed the conviction of the black majority that a continuous struggle against that despicable policy is the only way in which it can regain its freedom and put an end to the policy of racial discrimination. The current mass uprising in many parts of South Africa confirms this conclusion  which has become increasingly inescapable over the years.We appeal to the international community to support the struggle of the people of South Africa and call upon the Security Council - and particularly its permanent members - to do its duty and impose economic sanctions and a total boycott on the Pretoria Government to compel it to abandon its policy of racial discrimination.As regards Namibia  the Government of South Africa still disregards Security Council resolution 435 {1973}  which calls for the independence of Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations. I associate myself with the majority of Member States of this Organization in reaffirming the illegality of the elections and of the local measures imposed by the Government of South Africa in Namibia  contrary to all United Nations resolutions.The question of Afghanistan has been attracting the attention of the international community since 1979  when Soviet forces attacked that country and occupied it against the will of its people. The Soviet forces must  in accordance with repeated united Nations resolutions  pull out from Afghanistan so that the Afghan people may regain their freedom and select the system of government that they want  without any interference or threats  and resume the policy of non-alignment which they have chosen for themselves. We hope that the negotiations conducted through the united Nations between Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at finding a solution to this dispute will be crowned with success.As regards the question of Cyprus  we commend the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to create a favorable atmosphere that will lead to a just and lasting peaceful solution acceptable to both parties.With regard to Korea  we support the negotiations conducted by both parties under the auspices of the Red Cross with a view to the reunification of that country so that the people of Korea may realize their desire to live in comfort and prosperity.As we review the work of our Organization over the past 40 years  we would express the hope that every effort will be made to bring about is development. I have the honor to declare here that the State of Bahrain is not only fully prepared but also determined to act with other peace-loving Member States to bring about the achievement of the objectives of the Charter. We sincerely hope that our current historic session will adopt the resolutions necessary to solve the international problems confronting mankind  for they will have the most disastrous effects if they are not tackled by means of joint international action. It has become necessary for the existence of the human race to act seriously and sincerely to build for future generations a human community in which peace  justice and prosperity prevail."
"15",749,"BHS",40,1985,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and on my own behalf  I congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of this body. Yours is a challenging task  which I have every confidence you will execute with aplomb and with the dignity befitting such a high office  particularly during this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Your diplomatic experience and skill augur well for a successful session.I would also take this opportunity to commend Ambassador Lusaka for the excellent manner in which he conducted the business of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His abundant knowledge  cheerful manner and qualities of leadership enabled him to guide the Assembly through the difficult issues of his term of office.In addition  I am pleased to note this year with great appreciation the dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  to uphold and bring to fruition the high ideals and principles for which this great Organization stands.As the United Nations commemorates its fortieth anniversary  I recall with pleasure that over the years significant efforts have been made by the Organization to realize its purposes and principles as expressed in the Charter to which all of us as Members subscribe. Critics of the United Nations would have the world believe that the Organization is not effective in world affairs  that it is no longer the best tool to promote and maintain international peace and stability  but I say to such critics  what if there were not a United Nations? What if there were not a multilateral forum wherein nations could sit together and discuss their problems in an atmosphere of order and civility? I would hate to consider the perils of a world without a United Nations. As a noted commentator said at thebirth of this Organization- ""the world is inherent in the United Nations as an oak is in an acorn"".Therefore X am pleased to note the varied efforts being undertaken by Member nations to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. All over the world  national ceremonies  concerts  conferences  workshops  seminars and other events have been planned to commemorate the fortieth anniversary and  I trust  to serve as a re-commitment by Member nations to their obligations under the Charter and its fundamental purposes.I have taken note of the recommendations made at the meeting of past Presidents of the General Assembly. The ideas put forward by the Presidents reflect years of experience  knowledge and familiarity with the United Nations system and provide important advice as to how that system could be improved. Therefore it is my hope that due attention will be given to those recommendations.The Bahamas  in commemoration of the fortieth anniversary  has throughout this year sought to revive the spirit of the United Nations through a series of lectures and displays in schools  government departments and service organizations. This we shall continue to do as our way of recognizing and asserting the importance of the United Nations.This fortieth anniversary year is a fitting occasion for us to renew our commitment and dedication to the achievement of world peace. On 24 October 1985  when 1986 is declared the International Year of Peace  I urge that we all recommit ourselves to the fulfillment of the admonition of this General Assembly expressed in 1982  namely ""to devote a specific time to concentrate the efforts of the United Nations and its Member States to promote the ideals of peace and giveevidence of their commitment to peace in all viable ways"" (resolution 37/16). The global economy continues to be plagued by serious problems which demand our urgent attention. Such problems are exceptionally acute in developing countries  as the debt crisis has placed a severe burden on their economies. Protectionism threatens to exacerbate further our trade imbalance. Additionally  the international financial system has failed to respond effectively and efficiently to the plight of the poorer countries. The structural adjustments necessary to effect long-term solutions can be achieved only with the co-operation of the North and the South.From a long-term perspective  we must bolster the adequacy and efficiency of the international monetary and financial systems with a view to stabilizing international financial conditions and rendering them less capricious. This calls for  among other things  a wider sharing of the adjustment burden  ongoing consultations between debtors and creditors  international assistance to developing countries on debt management at the national level  including information on all aspects of external debt  and the application of the multi-year rescheduling mechanism to more debtor countries.We therefore concur with the view that  in an effort to mitigate future world economic crises  the traditional roles of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank must be expanded so that they might operate in a manner which would  first  facilitate adjustment processes  which at once sustain inflationary growth and protect and improve basic living standards; secondly  provide them with a catalytic stimulus to mobilize greater flows of private capital; thirdly  improve external debt management by developing better early warning and debt rescheduling mechanisms; and  fourthly  temper  rather than reinforce  cyclical fluctuations.The world has been visibly shaken by the devastating- effects of the drought situation in sub-Saharan Africa and the untold human suffering it has engendered. The Bahamas commends the laudable efforts of the international community  which have  to some extent  alleviated this dire situation. The Bahamas was pleased to be a part of this timely international endeavor.Alleviation of the acute situation may be acceptable as a short-term measure. To overcome the prevailing economic and environmental problems  however  increased sensitivity on the part of donor countries and international financial institutions is as vital as domestic policy reforms.Realistically speaking  the international community has no alternative but to come to grips with the interdependence of countries  not only in terms of international peace and security but also in terms of the global economy. This would of necessity involve the immediate strengthening of multilateral co-operation. Our challenge is to create a new era of prosperity. It is imperative  then  that we make the choices which lead to expansion of economies and markets.Everyone agrees that  if the arms race continues to escalate  all mankind would be annihilated. I am therefore amazed that billions of dollars are being spent on the acquisition of arms while millions of human beings are starving to death because of the unavailability of food.The international community has been seized of the question of disarmament since 1945 and to date we can point to few resolutions on disarmament that have been implemented. More than ever before there is the need to develop strong measures for a freeze on nuclear and conventional arms and to abolish the use of chemical weapons. States must be encouraged to adopt the concept of interdependence as the main course to positive solutions.To help make disarmament a reality  my Government welcomes regional approaches in establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones  or peace zones  as deterrents. We further support the view that effective implementation can be achieved in the following manner: first  the initiative must come from all States in the region; secondly  provision for compliance and verification must be made; thirdly  all parties should be prohibited from developing nuclear explosive devices; and  fourthly  existing security arrangements should not be disturbed to the deteriment of regional and international security.My Government is confident that  if serious negotiations are carried out at the forthcoming summit meeting between the Heads of State of the United States andcould be realized.In the past few years the matter of the security of small States has been addressed in various international bodies  including the General Assembly. The Commonwealth  the Organization of American States (OAS)  the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have all played an important role in identifying the problems of small States.Small States are particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of the international economic system. When global economic crises occur  the already fragile economic structures of small States are further weakened. Also  many small States  like the Bahamas  are archipelagos  and their configuration makes the absence of adequate transportation and communication a formidable obstacle to economic development. Added to this disadvantage is the fact that many small States  particularly in the Caribbean region  face the threat of exclusion from international developmental aid on the grounds that they are not among the most needy. The World Bank's process of ""graduation"" is one that ignores the real needs of small States. In particular  it overlooks the need to develop the domestic economic infrastructure of many small States.Equally important in the economic context is the fact that a large number of small States are constantly grappling with the need to develop economic alternatives in societies that operate largely on one major source of economic activity.Many small States are prone to natural disasters  such as hurricanes  tornadoes and floods. The precautions for  and the aftermath of  such natural disasters cause a severe drain on scarce resources.Various illegal activities threaten the stability and security of many small States. It has been the fate of the Bahamas  due to our archipelagic make-up  to be the subject of a significant illicit transit traffic in narcotic drugs  violations of air and maritime space  and illegal fishing. At times  we have been virtually helpless in the face of these adverse developments. Other small States have experienced illegal flows of arms and migration. The smallness of our populations and  in some cases  the wide dispersal of territory  does not easily enable us to police our borders.In the presence of larger  more powerful neighbors who threaten their territorial and political integrity many small States feel compelled to incur the expense of building up a defense force at great cost in manpower and financing.Given the difficulties many small States face in the economic sphere and in allocating human  financial and other resources to combat illegal activity  and in endeavoring to maintain their territorial and political integrity  it is incumbent upon the international community to help sustain their economic viability and assure their sovereignty. The Bahamas  a developing island State  would appeal to the international community to adhere strictly to the rules and norms enunciated in the Charter  which are indispensable to the stability and security of small States.The Government and the people of the Bahamas have already conveyed their profound sympathy and condolences to the Government and the people of the Republic of Mexico regarding the recent disastrous earthquakes. In this connection  my Government was happy to become a sponsor of the United Nations resolution on international relief to Mexico and applauds the swift action taken by this Assembly in adopting it.The Government of the Bahamas is gravely concerned about the deterioration of the situation in the Central American sub-region  which further imperils regional and international peace and security.We believe that the threat or use of force can only be counter-productive and should not be resorted to by any country. We therefore continue to support the Cantadora Group in its efforts to bring about a negotiated solution to the problems of that sub-region. To this end we concur with the view of the Contadora Group that the Governments of Central America must take action to implement the agreements arrived at in the Document of Objectives of September 1983.The Government of the Bahamas believes that the path to peace in the Middle East  while elusive  is one which the international community must continue to seek with tenacity. The crucial milestones on this path are as varied and tenuous as the conflicts themselves. Recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to a State of their own  implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and recognition of the right of Israel and all States in the region to exist peacefully would  we believe  go a long way towards establishing stability in that region.Similarly  the tragedy of Lebanon has been played on the world stage for far too long and must be brought to an end. This calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country  with concomitant recognition and respect for its territorial integrity and sovereignty. There is one ray of light and hope in this dark  tragic state of affairs: the realization that a solution must be just  lasting and comprehensive.A solution to the Cyprus problem has eluded us for far too long  and now once again recent developments in that country pose a serious threat to international peace and security in that region. The Bahamas takes the view that peace  human freedom and social and economic development are indivisible. We urge the speedy implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.The Iran-Iraq conflict continues to contribute to the instability  fragility and volatility of the entire region and we believe that every effort should be made through the Security Council and other diplomatic channels  involving closely those most aware of the dynamics of the region  to bring this conflict to an end.Our commitment to human rights should not be confined within our national borders but also be reflected in the international spirit of recognizing the fundamental and human rights of each and every individual. The Bahamas guarantees the full enjoyment of human rights to each and every citizen and resident  as outlined in articles 16 to 27 of its Constitution. Furthermore  article 28 provides for redress in the case of violation of human rights. The Bahamas  in its 12 years as an independent sovereign nation  has maintained the protection of human rights as a basic priority and it is our firm intent to remain thus committed.We take this opportunity to stress anew the importance of guaranteeing fundamental rights to human beings and recognizing that this principle is essential to the strong growth and development of individual nations as well as ""of the international community. May we in particular utilize 10 December  Human Rights Day  of this fortieth anniversary year  to renew with a fresh commitment and dedication the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Government and people of the Bahamas are heartened by the continuing and heightened defiance of the system of apartheid by the majority of South Africans. We are appalled by that abhorrent political  economic  social and legislative structure which denies fundamental rights and freedoms to people because of the color of their skin.Apartheid is a deplorable system; it is objectionable and offensive. It degrades and tramples on the dignity of human beings. The intent of the racist regime to maintain this system has become increasingly evident  in spite of the people's struggle for freedom and democracy. The state of emergency has occasioned the most brutal repression in recent history even of those committed to peaceful change.The Bahamas pays a special tribute to such noble persons as Nelson Mandela  who languishes in prison for daring to ask for justice for his people and Steve Biko and Victoria Mxenge  who made the supreme sacrifice for this cause. We unequivocally support such patriots as Bishop Desmond Tutu and the Reverend Allan Boesak  who continue to strive for justice. This Assembly should go on record as having called for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela.We are pleased to support the struggling people of South Africa  both morally and materially  and in this connection  are in favour of mandatory sanctions against South Africa and wish to commend those who have taken positive steps in that direction.As members of this world body we must support and give effect to its high principles regarding the dignity and worth of the human person. The eradication of apartheid demands our urgent and immediate attention.Years of work by the United Nations  the United Nations Council for Namibia  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the front-line States and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) were crystallized in Security Council resolution 435 (1973)  which represents a blueprint for independence for Namibia.South Africa's intransigence in defying the decisions of this Organization and its inflexibility and unwillingness to accept reasonable and sensible approaches have now been exacerbated by its recent unilateral decision to install a so-called interim government in Namibia. International outrage is surely justified in this instance. Further  the irrelevant and extraneous arguments introduced by South Africa serve only to justify its continued intransigence and its incursions into the territory of the front-line States.The Government and people of the Bahamas are committed to the achievement of independence for Namibia. We know that this is inevitable  because the international community cannot and will no longer tolerate the denial of self-determination to the people of Namibia.The Bahamas also reiterates its support for SWAPO  the recognized representative of the Namibian people.I take this opportunity to congratulate the United Nations and its relevant bodies on the work undertaken to date in the Eight against the international traffic in drugs.Nevertheless  illicit traffic in drugs and drug abuse continue to be an extremely grave problem in our societies. It will take the massive resolve and commitment of the entire international community to defeat this illicit activity and thereby the destructive influence it has on the moral and social fabric of our societies.The Bahamas is in the unenviable position of being squarely located between the major producer and consumer countries and the geographical configuration of the Bahamas itself makes it a haven for drug traffickers. As has been pointed out in past General Assemblies and other bodies of the United Nations  the Bahamas is not and has never been a producer of drugs nor a major consumer. However  consumption has increased directly in proportion to trafficking. Conversely  a direct and systematic campaign for the reduction of consumption would diminish production and trafficking. The developed consumer countries  with their superior resources and scientific expertise  can play an especially catalytic role in combating drug trafficking and abuse.The Bahamas is a young society. We are also a small resource-poor developing country dependent on a continuous influx of visitors who feel safe and relaxed in our islands. We cannot afford to have drug trafficking gain and retain an influential position in our society.The Government of the Bahamas remains fully committed to the eradication of international drug trafficking and drug abuse. We are working and will continue to work  for however long is necessary  with the relevant bodies of the United Nations and like-minded States in combating this problem.In this regard we welcome the proposal for the drafting of a new convention against drug trafficking and the proposal by the Secretary-General for a conference at ministerial level to address and find viable solutions to this problem.I am pleased to note that the United Nations Decade for Women was brought to a culmination with the consensus adoption of the document entitled ""Forward-looking Strategies to the year 2000"" by the Conference recently held in Nairobi  Kenya. This document is not only designed to improve the status of women and to integrate them into all aspects of development  but also seeks to ensure that during the next 15 years the international community strives as much as possible for world peace.It is particularly noteworthy that during this fortieth anniversary year of the United Nations such a historic document has been adopted by 157 nations of the world. This display of solidarity shows our efforts to integrate and cement our ideas not only on issues affecting women but also on many matters of over-all international concern.During the next 15 years  to ensure that the goals set forth in the ""Forward-looking Strategies"" are realized will require the good will and dedicated commitment of all nations to work actively towards that end. The Bahamas has always paid particular attention to promoting the interests of women.It is said that today's youth is probably the best-schooled generation in history and that over 850 million of the world's population are between the ages of 15 and 24. By the year 2000 it is expected that there will be 1 billion young people. It is also said that one of the most valuable resources of any country is its youth.Given these factors  the Bahamas has paid considerable attention to the development of its young people. The average age in the Bahamas is 25  and so it is our view that it is a vital necessity  and not mere idealistic fantasizing  to ensure that the needs and aspirations of young people are met. A number of activities and events were initiated in 1985 by the Ministry of Youth that were specifically geared not only towards the identification of the problems of youth but also towards working along with young people in seeking solutions to those problems.As the International Youth Year draws to a close I should like to commend the organizers on the very successful conferences and other international meetings and events which have been organized during the year. I am also pleased to note the conscious effort undertaken by the United Nations in focusing on young people and identifying the contribution they can and must make in shaping the future of humanity. In this regard particular note is taken of the important role of the United Nations youth training centers and the volunteers program.The Bahamas will continue to work actively in the interest of youth and to support the United Nations in its various endeavors to promote the interests of young people with a view to their developing their full potential as positive contributors to society and the world.From 16 to 22 October  the Bahamas will have the honor to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Nassau. This conclave will be attended by the leaders of 49 States which represent over a quarter of the world's population.It is a happy convergence of events that the meeting will take place during this session of the General Assembly  as I am sure that the meeting will have a positive impact on this Assembly's deliberations and will result in a healthy cross-fertilization of ideas and policies on the major issues that characterize the international environment today.The hosting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government involves for the Bahamas a reaffirmation of our strong support for international organizations as a whole  including the United Nations. Our support is as strong as it has always been  and continues to grow. On the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations it is my fervent hope that this Assembly's deliberations will be crowned with much success."
"16",821,"BLR",40,1985,"Sir  please accept our congratulations on the occasion of your election to the responsible post of President of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly as well as our wishes for the success of this session in achieving substantial results so that the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter may triumph.The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR extends its deepest condolences to the delegation of Mexico in connection with the misfortune that has befallen that country and its people  namely  the recent earthquakes which have resulted in many victims and widespread devastation.The fortieth anniversary of the victory over Hitlerite fascism and Japanese militarism in the Second World War and of the emergence in its wake of the United Nations confers particular importance on the current session of the United Nations General Assembly which should become not only a commemorative but also a substantive session  and a significant landmark in all the activities of our Organization Being one of the founding Members of the United Nations  the Byelorussian SSR has from the very beginning consistently and diligently worked to make the United Nations Charter a real instrument of peace and co-operation among nations so that the practical activities of the United Nations might contribute to the achievement of that lofty goal. This was what we strive for at the San Francisco Conference  and during the first post-war years when co-operation among the founders of the United Nations  born during the Second World War  still existed  in the ""cold war"" year j and in the period of detente  which has recently given way to a sharp exacerbation of the international situation  the responsibility for which rests with the forces of imperialism and reaction. In following this reliable and tine-tested peace-loving Leninist path of the Soviet Union's foreign policy  it has always been - and continues to be - our conviction that one should fight against war before it begins and that this requires the concerted and active efforts of all nations and peace-loving States.It is appropriate on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  to recall that  as far back as October 1943  the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the United States of America and Great Britain recognized  on the initiative of the Soviet union  the need to establish a universal international organization to maintain world peace and security  based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States.The founding of the United Nations was one of the results of the great victory of freedom-loving nations over the forces of fascism  reaction and militarism. The Soviet Union made a decisive contribution to that victory. He are also proud of the fact that more than 1 100 000 people of Byelorussia fought selflessly on the fronts of the great patriotic war to defeat the common enemy. The fascist invaders were dealt heavy blows by Byelorussian partisans and underground fighters who put 500 009 Hitlerite troops out of action.The Soviet people paid an enormous price in defending the freedom  honor and independence of their country. Twenty million people perished in the flames of the war. Their memory is sacred. In the year of the fortieth anniversary of the great victory we also pay tribute to the post-war exploits of those who rebuilt the devastated national economy from ruins and ashes and increased the industrial potential of the Byelorussian SSR to its present level which is 35 times greater than before the war  despite the fact that one-fourth of its population died in the war and over one-half of its national wealth was destroyed.In analyzing the activities of the United Nations in the past 40 years  we have every reason to emphasize that the Organization's Charter has successfully stood the test of time  despite ^oMe sharp turnabouts in the international situation. As we all know  159 countries of the world have assumed their obligations under tee United Nations Charter. Unfortunately  not all of them have been following the course mapped out in the Charter. The Organization has  undoubtedly  some achievements to its credit. However  its work is not free from shortcomings. A number of questions still await a final solution on the basis of resolutions adopted on the initiative of the States of the socialist community and the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement  which has become an influential force in the world today. Unfortunately  attempts are still being made to use the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States or to ' impose decisions which do not take into account the legitimate interests of all groups of the Organization's Member States  despite the fact that all this is in flagrant violation of the Charter.In the present complicated and dangerous international situation all States should abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  that is unite the efforts and actions of all States  large or small  with or without major military potential  developed or developing. By consolidating what has been achieved  preventing existing progressive decisions from being undermined and isolating aggressive and militaristic circles - the instigators of the arms race -all of us should  by our deeds rather than our words  act to promote peace and co-operation.As for the countries of the socialist community  this is precisely the way they have always acted. In this we were not deterred by the fact that our activities in the Organization on the basis of its Charter were sometimes described by the imperialist forces as ""bad behavior in the United Nations"". Experience demonstrates that the same course is followed by the overwhelming majority of the Organization's Member States which respect the United Nations Charter and are not trading away their principles or their positions. The purposes and principles of the United Nations are not being devalued. They have not been and will not be put on sale.In the 40 years of its membership in the United Nations the Byelorussian SSR has always set forth its position on all questions under discussion in precise and clear terms. Every word we have said and all our votes have always been guided by the interests of peace  the prevention of nuclear war  disarmament  the just and peaceful settlement of conflicts  speeding up the process of decolonization and the eradication of Nazism  racism and apartheid  fighting against injustice and violations of the United Nations Charter and developing co-operation for the benefit of economic and social progress  ensuring respect for human rights and developing and consolidating the rules of international law.In the current general political debate most speakers have pointed to tensions in the present international situation and to the importance of stabilizing it and putting it back on the track of detente and respect for the United Nations Charter. All this is indisputable. But it is also necessary to understand correctly what are the causes of this situation and what specific action should be taken to remedy it. The most important task in our time is to eliminate the threat of nuclear war  which requires preventing an arms race in space and putting an end to it on Earth. Not only the destinies of nations and States  but the fate of all mankind depends on finding a solution to this problem. There is no safe place on our planet where one could wait it out in case of a nuclear conflict  for such a conflict would destroy life itself on Earth. This should be borne in and when dealing with such current problems as overcoming the economic backwardness of a large group of young independent States  fighting hunger and disease  and other questions; it is important to see the main problem cm whose solution everything else hinges  namely  the problem of averting the nuclear threat  of doing everything to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  as required by the United Nations Charter.The fact that there has not been a world war for four decades and that the use of nuclear weapons has been prevented is mankind's greatest achievement. It is the result of the efforts of the Soviet Union  all countries of the socialist community  non-aligned States and other countries whose positions are based on responsibility for the destinies of their own and other nations. However  the threat of nuclear war  rather than decreasing  is growing as a result of the activities of militaristic forces which are eroding the foundations of peace.Let us look at the facts.Even at the first session of the United Nations General Assembly the Soviet Union proposed that nuclear weapons should be banned for all time and destroyed. What was the response of the United States? It continued to accumulate and upgrade its nuclear potential. The result was the appearance of ether nuclear Powers. Strategic stability was ensured  but at a higher level of weapons and with a greater risk of war.The Soviet Union has unilaterally pledged not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese People's Republic has assumed the same obligation. What was the response of the other nuclear lowers? They refused to follow this good example. They are also ignoring the united Nations appeal to this effect. NATO's military doctrine allows members of that bloc to be the first to use nuclear weapons even in a conflict involving conventional weapons.As is known  the Soviet Union has unilaterally pledged not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries which do not have such weapons on their territories. What was the response of the Western nuclear Powers? Vague statements which  incidentally  do not rule out the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states in some circumstances.The Soviet union has pledged not to place anti-satellite weapons in space so long as other States act in a similar manner  what was the response of the United States? It has just carried out a test of an anti-satellite weapon against a target in space as part of its notorious ""star wars"" program.The Soviet union has temporarily suspended the deployment of medium-range missiles and the implementation of other countermeasures in Europe. What was the response of the United States? It has continued to increase the number of Pershing-2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe.The Soviet Union has stopped all nuclear explosions as of 6 August until the end of this year and has stated that this unilateral moratorium could continue beyond that date if the United States does not carry out nuclear tests. What was the response of the United States? After this it has already carried out two tests of nuclear weapons.It is also known to all what kind of attitude this or that country adopts towards the United Nations resolutions on the prevention of nuclear war and militarization of space  on disarmament and strengthening international security. The Soviet Union has been putting forward such proposals; it supports the initiatives of the non-aligned countries and insists on their realization  while the United States has been voting against them  often finding itself in complete isolation  and  wherever possible  has been sabotaging work in this area.Such actions of the united States and of its closest allies give rise to justifiable alarm and should be countered with even stronger efforts. The international community  concerned with preserving life on our planet  should resolutely oppose the American ""star wars"" plans  which are directed against peace on Earth under the guise of propaganda rhetoric about their allegedly defensive nature  and support the new Soviet initiative on international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space in conditions of its non-militarization.The new Soviet proposal is based on the idea of uniting the efforts of States for the sake of preventing the militarization of space and reserving it for peaceful activities for the benefit of all countries. Joint exploration of space and the use of the use of the results of space-related research for the benefit of all is quite a realistic possibility  if all channels for militarizing near-Earth space are blocked off. Detailed concrete proposals to this effect are contained in the document submitted by the Soviet Union at the current session of the General Assembly  entitled ""Main lines and principles of international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space under conditions of its non-militarization""  and in the corresponding draft resolution on this question. I draw the attention of representatives to document a/40/192.In conditions of non-militarization of space and of ""star peace"" the Soviet union is proposing a qualitatively new stage of international co-operation in space exploration. There is now a possibility of using the enormous scientific-technological and production potential for the solution of global problems facing mankind  including the developing countries. For these purposes it is proposed that an international conference should be convened in 1987 at the latest  with the participation of States having major space potential and other interested countries  to discuss in its entirety the question of international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation and use of outer space in conditions of its non-militarization and to follow it up with the establishment of a world space organization. We hope that having carefully considered the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union  the participants in the current session of the united Nations General Assembly will support it.Work should also continue to unite the efforts of States for the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests by all countries everywhere  for freezing the existingnuclear potentials and starting their reduction  eventually leading to their complete elimination  for renouncing chemical warfare arsenals  and  naturally  for preventing the appearance of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction and resolving other issues of disarmament  having in mind  as the final objective  general and complete disarmament under strict international control.One might ask whether a solution to all these problems can be found. We believe that this is certainly so. This is confirmed by past experience and by the approach outlined in the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. Is it not a fact that the countries of the anti-Hitlerite coalition were able to work together  fight for victory and lay the foundation of the post-war world which retains significance to this day? The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe also offers convincing proof that  given good will and desire to come to agreement and take into consideration the legitimate interests of all and everyone  it is possible to resolve the most complex problems and to accomplish that within a short time. United Nations Member States have to their credit a number of well-known multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements aimed at limiting the nuclear-arms race  including a race in outer space  and at avoiding a nuclear conflict. Common efforts have made it possible to put an end to a number of conflicts and eliminate some hotbeds of tension.It is important  while fulfilling all obligations  to move forward and strive for better results. It would then be possible to expect success at the Geneva negotiations on space and nuclear weapons  both medium-range and strategic  taking into account their interrelationship. The new Soviet proposals also open the way to that goal. Success could then be expected at the Stockholm Conference in the form of a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force  the maintenance of peaceful relations and the adoption of confidence-building measures equally applicable to all participants. It would then be possible to break the deadlock in the Vienna negotiations and to reduce armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Then it would be possible to hope for the implementation of United Nations resolutions on preventing a nuclear catastrophe  strengthening international security  disarmament  restructuring international economic relations  and solving other problems facing all mankind.What is necessary to achieve all that is above all joint  active efforts against the intention of certain circles in the United States to achieve military superiority and impose their will on others. The time has long come to realize that malicious rhetoric about ""communist danger"" and ""Soviet threat"" is not really convincing. Socialism  with its ideals and their practical realization  has provided impressive proof of its devotion to the cause of peace and the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems and of its capacity to accomplish the tasks of economic and social progress in the interest and for the benefit of man.Whatever problem we look at  it is perfectly clear that the States of the socialist community offer constructive solutions  based exclusively on the common interest  and seek no unilateral advantages or special benefits for themselves.This attitude is also clearly seen in our position on the issue of a just and comprehensive settlement of the situation in the Middle East and the problem of Palestine. This position is well known and has been repeatedly reflected in resolutions of the United Nations  which still await practical implementation. I wish to emphasize in this regard that we shall continue to oppose firmly all attempts to undermine the decisions of the United Nations on this question  to impose on the Arab peoples separate capitulationist deals  or to bar the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from participating in the Middle East settlement.The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR resolutely condemns Israel's barbarous bombing of the territory of Tunisia and the PLO headquarters.The situation in Central America and the Caribbean continues to move in a dangerous direction. The constructive proposals put forward by Nicaragua  Cuba  the countries of the Contadora Group and other states  which could lead to a normalization of the situation  are being ignored and undermined by the United States and its partners - again in open contradiction with the requirement of the United Nations Charter ""to live together in peace as good neighbors"". The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the situation in Central America  which was adopted unanimously  also remains unimplemented. Additional steps in must therefore be taken with urgency to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the countries of Central America and to make it possible for them to live as their peoples choose and desire rather than under orders from outside.Also necessary are determined effort in defense of the legitimate rights and interests of the people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  who have opted for a new life and embarked firmly upon the path of independent development  resolutelyrejecting imperialist interference in their internal affairs and stoutly rebuffing the subversive actions of the armed mercenaries of imperialism and reaction.A general improvement in the situation in Asia and the Pacific would be facilitated by a positive response by the States of the region to the proposals of the USSR for examination of the whole complex of issues pertaining to the strengthening of security and the development of equitable co-operation among the States of Asia and the proposals of the Mongolian People's Republic and the States of Indochina to make Asia a continent of peace  stability  good-neighborliness and co-operation. This would also be facilitated by the implementation of the United Nations decisions on the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and on the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. We support the proposals of the Korean People's Democratic Republic aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea and the conversion of the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.In concluding this part of my statement  I wish to point out that  in the present international situation  the Assembly must insist on the full implementation of its resolution  adopted last year  on the inadmissibility of the policy of State terrorism and any actions by States aimed at undermining the socio-political system in other sovereign States.We cannot but speak with satisfaction about the collapse of colonial domination in the world  a result of the impact of the ideas of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia and of the defeat of the forces of fascism and militarism in the Second world War  which gave new strength to the fighters for peace and independence in Asia  Africa and Latin America. The United Nations  too  has played a positive role in the process of decolonization  especially since theadoption  following the initiative of the Soviet Union  of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of that historic document by the United Nations must be observed appropriately. Of course  the best way to do this would be to adopt measures immediately to ensure the independence of Namibia and other colonial Territories and to abolish the Trusteeship System completely. For there remains today only one Trust Territory  Micronesia  whose self-determination and independence are opposed by the United States  which so ostentatiously vaunts its freedom-loving and democratic ways.The Assembly must also give its close attention to the question of the struggle against manifestations of neo-Nazism  fascism and revanchism.It is necessary to redouble the efforts in the struggle against the remaining hotbeds of racism and apartheid  those festering and disgraceful wounds of the 20th century. In this regard more determined actions than those so far taken are required. Specifically  a full boycott and comprehensive sanctions in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter should be imposed against the South African racists  who have unleashed mass terror against the indigenous population of the country vigorously fighting for its freedom.The participants in this session of the General Assembly are giving much attention to economic problems. Young States continue to seek ways of extricating themselves from various forms of dependence  both those inherited from the former colonial system of imperialism and those being imposed on them by the neo-colonialists. They are justifiably critical of the policy of Western financial and economic institutions  which has brought the developing countries to the brink of economic catastrophe.Throughout the entire history of the united Nations the socialist countries have repeatedly put forward their proposals and supported proposals by other countries aimed at improving international economic relations  safeguarding the interests of the developing countries and ensuring the economic security of all States. Much has been accomplished. However  not all progressive recommendations of the United Nations are being implemented.In addition  the major Western Powers  resorting to various methods and tactics  have often succeeded in spreading hostility  in misleading the developing countries and in dividing them. The West is constantly flaunting the idea that only private capital and the private economy can solve all problems  that if one opens the way to foreign private capital everything will be fine. At the same time if: cannot refrain from boasting and displaying its wealth - concealing  of course  the fact that all that wealth has been acquired as a result of the unashamed plundering of the natural and human resources of other peoples and the exploitation of its own working people without a fair solution to social problems.Just remember the praise lavished on the four points of the Truman program  the Alliance for Progress in Latin America and the economic policies of the present United States Administration. What are the results? The developing world has found itself chained in new shackles  the shackles of financial debt to its ""benefactors""  and is in fact deprived of the possibility of solving the existing economic and social problems in the interests of the peoples of the developing countries.It is time to dismantle the barriers and remove the obstacles and difficulties created by the Western Powers and get down to the business of the genuine restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.Speaking of human rights and fundamental freedoms  I wish to underscore the point that the socialist countries have in actual deed demonstrated to the whole world the validity of the ideas put forward by the founder of the Soviet State  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin  who said that without socialist transformation of society it was impossible to speak about true freedom for the individual rather than for proprietors  about genuine equality of men in the socio-political sense rather than about hypocritical equality between the haves and the have-nots  the sated and the hungry  the exploiters and the exploited.Our achievements in the genuine realization of a broad range of political  civil  economic  social and cultural rights of the individual are well known. They are recorded  in particular  in many United Nations documents  including those that deal with the implementation of the international legal instruments in this field  in which our Republic participates in good faith. That is why we reject the hypocrisy and demagogy of those who represent a country which has not show the slightest desire to become a party to the international covenants on human rights and other international documents relating to that subject widely recognized and used by the world community. They apparently believe that by employing those methods they can hide or camouflage a rather poor state of affairs in their own house.I should like to say a few words about the methods of our work at the present session. Our delegation  like many others  is in favor of the adoption of concrete agreed decisions and of their subsequent universal implementation. This  unfortunately  is not always possible  because a number of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries show a tendency to empty some issues of substance under the pretense of seeking consensus. Reasonable and mutually acceptable compromises are indispensable. However  we cannot agree that the purposes and principles of our Organization should be jeopardized under any pretext whatever. That is why we are also in favor of adopting decisions by voting  so as not to allow the forces of imperialism  aggression and militarism  the instigators of the arms race  colonialists and racists to obstruct the adoption of United Nations resolutions aimed at attaining the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter.The tasks confronting the United Nations and its members are numerous; they are complex and urgent. But all those problems can undoubtedly be solved. The main prerequisite is that every State should comply with  rather than undermine the Charter  and manifest genuine political will to solve the existing problems on the basis of equality  with due regard for common interests  without prejudice to the security of each other  and to the mutual advantage of everyone.As stated by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Comrade Mikhail S. Gorbachev ""The only sensible way out today is to develop active co-operation among all States in the interest of a common peaceful future  to create  use and develop international mechanisms and institutions which would make it possible to find the optimum balance between national and State interests and the interests of mankind.""The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic  like other socialist countries  considers the United Nations to be an important and effective instrument of peace and equitable co-operation between States. We shall continue to work for the practical implementation in international relations of the just and democratic principles on which the United Nations was founded 40 years ago. The United Nations must become a true embodiment of the collective wisdom of States. At the current jubilee session of the General Assembly the delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic is prepared  as before  together with all interested countries  to make every effort to accomplish the main task of the United Nations under the Charter  that of maintaining and strengthening peace  and to deal with all other problems on that basis."
"17",856,"BLZ",40,1985,"On the historic occasion of this fortieth session of the General Assembly  we hail the fact that mankind has endured. We have survived intact through the sometimes uncomfortable period between the end of the last World War and the threat of a later  more complete destruction.Much of the credit goes to this Organization  and much to the success of the deliberative mechanisms structured within the system of the United Nations and enshrined in its Charter  mechanisms which have institutionalized and underscored the universal recognition of the continuing need for the nations of planet earth to live together in some semblance of civilized behavior.To be sure  the success of the United Nations has been limited  for the United Nations has seen an imperfect instrument in an uncertain world  but the very fact of our survival is a cause for celebration. Belize therefore joins the rest of the community in recording its appreciation of the efforts of this Organization in helping to ward off the ultimate destruction of humanity  which the awesome elements of our technology have made so frighteningly possible.We congratulate you  Mr. President  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly  in full confidence that the brilliant record as statesman and conciliator that you bring to this high office will be placed at our disposal during the coming months.For your predecessor  Belize's great friend  Paul Lusaka  we have the highestwords of praise for his inspired leadership of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  and for the manner in which he conducted the deliberations of this body during his term of office. We wish him well in what must surely continue to be a distinguished career in the service of his country  Zambia  and of the wider international community.Since the last session of the General Assembly  the people of Belize have exercised their democratic right to choose another vision of what their future should be. They have chosen growth instead of stagnation; expansion  instead of contraction; hope  instead of despair. They have chosen the United Democratic Party  under the leadership of Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel  to lead Belize as their newly elected Government. This choice was freely made  without coercion  without bloodshed and without recrimination  and Belizeans have chosen a Government dedicated to the cause of freedom  personal independence and democratic development.The task of the new Government now is to demonstrate the boldness of action necessary to translate beliefs and principles into reality  proceeding in the confidence that within the Belizean people lie the power and the will to transform their lives and the life of the nation.Our most important goal is to stimulate economic growth and move the nation to increased employment and prosperity. Accordingly  domestic policies are being put into effect aimed at dignifying Belizeans in all walks of life.Inheriting an economy that has been virtually crippled by the burdens imposed upon us by the limitations of the past  as well as the greater problems arising from unsatisfactory world economic conditions  we do not pretend to face an easy task.We are not alone in decrying the external factors over which we have no control and which have proved a scourge to every developing country. We continue to face a decline in both the markets and the prices offered for our primary products mainly because of protectionist policies adopted by the importing countries. Our access to international financial assistance becomes more and more limited with the imposition of more difficult - and at times socially unacceptable - conditions for borrowing and repayment. And the debt burden grows heavier with the rise in international interest rates.While we adhere fully to the principle of observing international obligations  we urge the financial community to look with favor at proposals to reduce the crushing burden of debt repayments. The concept - already developed by some of our sister Latin American nations - of linking repayments to export earnings  is clearly a meritorious one.In his report to the united Nations this year  the Secretary-General makes pointed reference to the inclination of many countries to resort to protectionism to solve their own problems at the expense of other countries. We too lament this trend towards economic nationalism and urge the implementation of a universal legal principle of obligation to enhance the development of less-advantaged peoples. The problems of poorer countries must continue to be the focus of attention  and the countervailing growth of quasi-regionalism and bilateralism among the big countries must be retarded.A pillar of our own economic development in Belize is the free enterprise system. But it is difficult for those who want to believe in the wisdom of the system to contemplate its continuing unfairness  where the industrialized world withholds necessary assistance and co-operation; where multilateral financial institutions inject political considerations into eligibility criteria; and where sovereign Governments are told that they must accept externally imposed macro-economic prescriptions or face intolerable contractions in the financial flows from world lending institutions.Free enterprise should serve the interests of development  not challenge the bases of our fragile economies  nor act as the instrument for the further impoverishment of poor societies. And developing nations like Belize  with small open economies  must wage a constant struggle to preserve their independence and their sovereignty in the face of the geopolitical realities of implied coercion in an increasingly bipolar world.As a small Central American and Caribbean State  Belize's foreign policy must of necessity project domestic concerns but be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence  political pluralism  non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We must vigilantly and unselfishly act in solidarity with other small States experiencing similar problems and sharing common concerns.These are the principles that guide Belize's relationship with members of the Caribbean community  who share with us a kinship born of a common cultural heritage  a common history and a common colonial experience. We are committed to acting in concert with our Caribbean sister States to make the subregional grouping more effective  more integrated and more representative of the aspirations of our people. And we urge the co-operation of extra-regional nations with the policy that the Caribbean be made a zone of peace.In the normal course of events  there is also a coincidence of interests with the larger hemispheric nations  particularly the United States. My Government  however  does not subscribe to any doctrine of geographic determinism. The fact of our being located within the so-called sphere of influence of a world Power cannot dictate that Belize's freedom of action in its international relations should be circumscribed by any need for an external imprimatur.Belize's relations with neighboring States on our Central American mainland are based on respect for national self-determination  sovereignty and the right of all peoples to choose their own political  social and economic systems free from external threats and pressures. We have of our own accord  however  chosen to subscribe fully to the principles of parliamentary democracy  and we note with satisfaction the marked trend towards the democratization  or perhaps re-democratization  of our America.The violence that continues to consume Central America and cause wrenching dislocations of people from their homelands is regrettable and weighs heavily on our ability as peace-loving nations to create the conditions for a return to normality in our region.My Government has a particular concern in this matter because the trans-border migration of those fleeing the conflicts has produced an influx of refugees into Belize which strains our already thinly stretched social and economic resources and threatens to produce serious ethnic and demographic tensions.Furthermore  Belizeans  with our history of peaceful and stable development  cannot forever remain immune to the inherent hostility and mistrust that characterize the evolution of the conflict in this region. We cannot ignore the attempts being made by outside Powers to exploit historical and prevailing conditions in air effort to gain advantage in the global East-West confrontational struggle.We maintain the view that a regional political solution is imperative. We hold to the thesis that the Contadora process is the best means to deal with the situation.During the 10 months of the new administration in Belize  the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet have had an opportunity to begin discussions and exchange views with members of the Contadora countries on developments in Central America. Throughout these discussions  one theme has been recurring  and that is the need finally to put in place the mechanisms which will ensure a lasting solution to the regional problem.There is now an urgent need for the protagonists in the conflict to summon up the act of political will necessary for the signing of the final draft of the Contadora Act on peace and co-operation in Central America. For only then will there be an elimination of the distances that have been created between polities and groups by artificial political and economic philosophies. And only then will the sovereignty and independence of the States of Central America be strengthened and the creative energies of our people freed to concentrate on the developmental activities necessary to assure us prosperous  well-ordered societies.My Government has no desire to complicate further the problems of the region  but in view of the still unresolved claim by the Republic of Guatemala to the territory of Belize  we consider the security and defense of our homeland to be our highest foreign policy priority.The new Government of Belize committed itself to showing realism and flexibility so that a peaceful  diplomatic solution can be found. To that end we participated in informal discussions with officials of the Guatemalan Government earlier this year in order to explore ways of arriving at a solution which recognizes Belizean solidarity and our right to maintain and preserve intact our present and constitutional borders  a solution that will do this even as it seeks to satisfy some of the relevant security concerns of Guatemala.However  it must be made clear that the independence of Belize is irreversible. It is a practical and legal fact of international life. To seek to maintain otherwise is counter-productive and counter-historical. In order for any real progress to be made  discussions and negotiations with Guatemala must reflect this reality.Belizeans applaud the signals of a return to democracy and civilian rule in Guatemala and fully expect understanding and flexibility in future discussions with a civilian administration.A prelude to harmonious relations between Belize and Guatemala  then  is the recognition that two separate  sovereign entities share a common border. Both are involved in the search for better conditions of life for their citizens. This search can best be conducted in an atmosphere of peace  stability and internal security.Good-neighborliness between our two countries  as well as mutual understanding and respect  can help remove the barriers and mistrust that have prevented us from living together as neighbors should. This is the position of Belize. He appeal to the authorities in Guatemala to respond positively.On another aspect of our security concerns  my Government has been greatly exercised by  and absolutely condemns  the blot on our society that is the production of and trafficking in drugs.Over the past five years  and spurred en by the phenomenal and continually expanding consumer market provided by the United States  Belize has become a large-scale producer of and trafficker in marijuana. He do not need anyone to tell us of the insidious nature of the threat posed by this aberrant activity - to our institutions  to the moral and ethical dimensions of our national life  and to the very rule of law and democracy in our country.Within the limits of our resources we have made Herculean efforts to stamp out the trade and to defeat the danger of destabilization which it poses. Since the beginning of this year joint military/ police operations have succeeded in destroying over 80 000 marijuana plants and 70 000 pounds of processed marijuana. Some 375 persons have been charged in our country for dealing in marijuana and 288 have so far been convicted. In the past 6 months alone four United States registered aircraft and 10 motor vehicles have been seized by the police and confiscated by our courts.That is why we find it so distressing when the claim is advanced that Belize has failed to eradicate any of its drug crop. To say that is to propagate disinformation of the most malicious sort. To be sure  we have had differences of opinion with others who engage in the war against drugs  principally over the methodology to be used in our own eradication campaign. Aerial spraying of marijuana plantations using chemical herbicides has been pressed upon us  but we have so far preferred to employ manual eradication methods until we can assure ourselves and our people that the aerial-spraying exercise would involve no unacceptable health or environmental risks. Even now  we are taking steps which will enable us to make that determination.That position has not proved satisfactory to some  which is regrettable. But power disequilibrium cannot be allowed to defeat the sovereign right of small States to act in what they consider to be their national interests. We must therefore stand at this rostrum today and  in accordance with the Charter  reject the threat of coercion implied in the possibility that has been held before us of an aid cut-off or other measure designed to force us to move prematurely and in a way we consider undesirable.In the wider hemispheric context my Government regrets the exclusion of Belize from the Organization of American States. We trust that the obstacles which nowprevent us from becoming a full member of that important body will soon be overcome. He rely on the wisdom  statesmanship and responsibility of the members of the Permanent Council to refashion the Charter of that organization to accommodate the spirit of hemispheric unity and universality envisaged by the Charter's framers.My Government's world view generates the imperative for Belize to be an outspoken advocate for parliamentary democracy  for mutual co-operation among States in the world community and for scrupulous respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of our citizens.He believe in the multilateral approach to resolving some of the pressing economic  social and political problems facing us as nations and as political groupings. Any retreat from multilateralism  in our view  erodes the effectiveness of political communities acting in concert and isolates the smaller and weaker among us from the benefits of joint action. Such retreat is especially to be regretted in this fortieth anniversary year of the United Nations  for the very raison d'etre of the United Nations was interdependence  as was made clear by the 1 January 1942 Declaration that created the wartime alliance  and as is stressed in the Atlantic Charter incorporated in the 1942 Declaration which  in a very real sense  is the forerunner of the present-day United Nations Charter.With all this in view  Belize reiterates its commitment to all regional and international organizations of which we are a member  including the Caribbean Community  the Commonwealth of nations  the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. While we feel that there are those who have sought to convert the Non-Aligned Movement into a forum for ritual and strident name-calling  and  while we view that as counterproductive  my Government nonetheless feels that the spirit of Bandung  the original principles that animated the Movement  can still be a force for world peace.My Government supports the original initiatives of the Group of 77  as ratified by the General Assembly  which resulted in the call for a new international economic order. The main goals of the new international economic order are of clear relevance and importance to Belize  since we suffer the common problems and the common concerns of other third-world countries.Belize commits itself to co-operate fully in the effort to persuade the developed countries that the prosperity of the international community as a whole depends on the prosperity of its constituent parts and that the political  economic and social wellbeing of present and future generations depend more than ever on co-operation among all the members of the international community on the basis of sovereign equality.Belizeans are profoundly concerned that while we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and hail the many accomplishments of the Organization and its positive influences over the emerged world order we also mark the fortieth anniversary of the denial to the Namibian people of their right to freedom and independence.We agonize over the sheer powerlessness of the international community to exert effective pressure on the white rulers of South Africa to loosen their stranglehold on the fate of the black peoples of southern Africa.Every step - however little and however late - taken by countries in a position to influence the course of events in southern Africa in an effort to dismantle the morally corrupt and internationally discredited regime of apartheid is a practical demonstration of support for the right of the black majority in its struggle to control its own destiny.Apartheid is a crime against humanity  and apartheid South Africa has forfeited the right to be regarded as a member of the community of nations. All measures aimed at isolating that regime need to be intensified. The argument that mandatory  effective sanctions will only aggravate the plight of the already suffering black people of South Africa is a spurious one  patronizing at best and  at worst  a dishonest excuse for the inaction that will perpetuate abhorrent apartheid.Mo less emphatic are we with regard to the need to safeguard the rights of the inhabitants of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic  or the rights of the peoples of East Timor and of the Western Sahara to determine their awn destiny  of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and the right of Israel to exist within secure borders  of the rights of the Lebanese people who yearn for peace  of the Afghan people to regain control of their own land and of the Kampucheans to reestablish their sovereignty.We find it ironic that the Near and Middle East  which have been the cradle of so many of the world's Lading cultures  should today be the scene of so much tension and so much strife. There must be an end to those unbrotherly actions which  for example  prolong the war between Iran and Iraq.Finally  we call for immediate action to alleviate the plight of all those countries suffering from hunger  starvation  desertification and disease.There is no doubt that those wise men who drafted the Charter of the United Nations 40 years ago in San Francisco contemplated the evolution of an imperfect world. They foresaw disharmony and conflict. That is why the Charter stresses conflict resolution and co-operation among States. Much has changed in those 40 years  but the basic goals remain the same.Of greatest immediacy is whether the world as we know it will survive for another 40 years. Accordingly  we call on all Member States to make this fortieth anniversary a time of re-dedication  a time of renewal. Let us strive with increased assiduity  not for military victories but for diplomatic solutions  not for nuclear advantage but for the safety of the human race.Belize insists that it is within the principles and practices of the United Nations system  and of its multilateral approach to global peace  that wefind the best means of avoiding the apocalyptic prospect - mankind's finalnightfall."
"18",903,"BOL",40,1985,"First of all I should like to express to you  Sir  the satisfaction of the Bolivian Government at your election as President of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to you and to Spain  which is so close to the heart of Latin America.I should also like to express the profound feeling of national gratitude Bolivia feels with regard to the vigorous activities undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Javier Perez de Cuellar  to bring about international understanding of our problems. That attitude is coupled with the outstanding qualities he has demonstrated in the exercise of his office and in the fulfillment of his great responsibilities.My country earlier expressed its great grief at the catastrophe Mexico has suffered  and I should like to reiterate our sympathy  solidarity and fraternal support to that great brother nation.I have come to this rostrum to pay a tribute to the United Nations on its fortieth anniversary. Bolivia was present at its inception and helped to bring it into being as an expression of the deep desire for peace felt by a world that had just emerged from the agonies and destruction of war. Now we are here to join our voice  however modest it may be  in support of the spirit that prevailed at San Francisco and that  to the small nations of the world  represents the concrete embodiment of the principle of the legal equality of all States  with respect to which we associated ourselves yesterday  not to be the instrument of the strong but rather the voice of the weak and defenseless of the earth.Here I should like for a moment to touch upon the work and contribution made by a group of enlightened young Bolivian diplomats who in 1945 were committed to the ideals of the Bolivian national revolution and who signed the United Nations Charter. We pay tribute to them and we should like to do so in the person of Ambassador Carlos Salamanca  who is present at this fortieth session of the General Assembly once again as a member of the Bolivian delegation. He has grown older in his outstanding services to the Organization and to Bolivia during 15 of the Assembly's 40 sessions.American law contributed decisively to the inclusion in the Charter of new concepts of collective security and self-defense in Chapter VIII  which deals with the regional settlement of disputes. Bolivian law also had an influence on the drafting of the Charter by expanding the bases of international relations  contributing to bringing about the inclusion in the rather cold reference to treaties the concept of international justice that appears in paragraph 3 of the preamble and in Article 14  thus rooting in the foundations of the Organizations the principle that underlies Bolivia's maritime concerns.Bolivia for the first time supported recognition of the right of peoples freely to control their natural resources  and I can say with pride that my country also sponsored the first resolution adopted by the United Nations dealing with the rejection of racial discrimination  a principle that we reiterate today as we renew our total condemnation of apartheid and our unswerving support for the emancipation of Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations.Bolivia  as a founding Member of the United Nations  wishes at this anniversary session to reaffirm the obligations it has contracted under the Charter and to reiterate its total commitment to the purposes and principles contained therein.The defense of national sovereignty  the right of peoples to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention are a guarantee of our national dignity  the sole reliable guarantee upon which our independence rests and to which we can have recourse in order not to be in thrall to the great Powers.We Bolivians will not allow any foreign interest to dictate the conduct of our country. Only Bolivians  and they alone  are entitled to correct our errors  change our course or determine our future.Bolivia was the first Latin American country invited to participate in the Non-Aligned Movement-. In our view non-alignment is not some negative neutrality; instead  it is the most rigorous and consistent adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and a militant conviction that impels to adopt an uncompromising position vis-a-vis the great world Powers.My Government's international policy is based on those postulates. We share the concern for rigorous respect for our political independence  our territorial integrity  our right to live free from coercion. We cannot agree with the proposition that there exists a hierarchy of sovereignty  and we are actively opposed to the arms race  which must be eliminated in order to avoid a world confrontation that could reduce the planet to dust and rubble.The Non-Aligned Movement is vigilant with regard to justice and equity in international relations. It has spoken out with a frequency appropriate to each case  calling for the righting of historic wrongs  and with particular emphasis on matters affecting the vital functioning of States. It is in that framework that the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement have expressed constant solidarity with Bolivia's cause in its efforts to recover a sovereign and useful outlet to the Pacific Ocean.Bolivia  because of its geographical situation in the center of South America  is affected by three of the continent's hydro-graphic basins. It is the contact country for the five republics that border it. This geographical position thus makes it essential for Bolivia to have an outlet to the Pacific. Bolivia became an independent republic in 1825  and at that time my country had a coast over which it exercised full sovereignty for more than half a century. It was subsequently deprived of that outlet by a war of conquest. Never has it waived  nor will it renounce  its right to an outlet to the sea and to a full return to the community of nations.It relies on the solidarity of the international community. The countries members of the Organization of American States (OAS) have over the last six years reiterated that""it is a matter of standing hemispheric interest to find an equitable solutionwhereby Bolivia may obtain a sovereign and useful access to the Pacific Ocean.""I wish to take this opportunity to thank from this rostrum the 130 countries throughout the world that have given Bolivia their support  solidarity and fraternal understanding in its maritime quest.However  Bolivia now wishes to look to the future and to leave behind an unfortunate period  opening instead a new page of peace and understanding. Guided by this intention  it reiterates it traditional openness to dialog with Chile within the context of the exhortations and resolutions of the Organization of American States (OAS) and with a minimum of preconditions being set by the parties as a guarantee of a bona fide willingness to reaching a practical settlement which  while having due regard for the reciprocal interests of the countries concerned  will not put Bolivia's territorial heritage at stake.Bolivia proclaims its support for all multilateral means of solving disputes  faithful as it is to the principles of the Charter  without prejudice to the usefulness of bilateral solutions. We feel that the bilateral and multilateral options are not mutually exclusive but can be used in conjunction.During a period that was not as marked as today is by a balance of terror and a threat of nuclear destruction  President Victor Paz Estenssoro stated when addressing the General Assembly in 1963:""We must advance towards the total prohibition of nuclear weapons and general and complete disarmament until finally we get to the point of outlawing war."" (A/PV.1252  p. 11) He also stated on that occasion that the great Powers appeared to rely on force rather than on the law.In taking stock of the 40 years of the work of the United Nations  we observe that that warning is still valid. It is necessary for all Member States to make a decisive contribution to a campaign of disarmament to bring about peace and ensure the survival of mankind. The resources now devoted to the arms race should be freed in order to raise the standards of living of the great majority of peoples still struggling with backwardness  ignorance and hunger.Every twenty-four hours the world squanders approximately $2 140 million on the arms race. It is impossible to calculate the amount of suffering  insecurity and poverty that any of the poor countries in the world could be spared by the use of such a sum of money. It is even harder to imagine the amount'  of pain  destruction and death that such a sum of money could unleash upon the earth. When one thinks of this terrible and horrifying reality  the most frightful thing of all is the lack of moral awareness on the part of those who gamble with the hunger of peoples and the survival of mankind.A feeling of insecurity has been created by the instability resulting from the foreign interference in Central America. My Government considers that the causes of this lengthy crisis are to be found in unjust economic and social structures  and that the increasing militarization of the area has further aggravated the crisis. Bolivia commends the work carried out by the countries of the Contadora Group in seeking to reach peacefully negotiated solutions through the Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. Bolivia undertakes to help in ensuring that this instrument will guarantee the security of the region within a framework of self-determination and the application of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.My Government reiterates its support for the cause of the Republic of Argentina with regard to the recovery of its sovereignty over the Malvinas islands  and it expresses its concern over the deployment of nuclear weapons on those islands in violation of existing treaties. As has been stated at various times  Bolivia is in favor of a peacefully negotiated solution of the dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom through the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.My country has noted with interest the proposals presented by the Soviet Unionto curb the arms race and bring about collective efforts for the elimination of wars and local conflicts. Similarly  it believes that the wide-ranging proposals presented by the United States help to improve the climate of the negotiations to be held between the major Powers so as to reach an agreement that will strengthen strategic stability and ensure deterrence through the achievement of an equitable and lasting agreement.My Government rejects any intervention or military occupation by foreign forces whenever it may occur. Accordingly it condemns the military occupation of the territories of Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus and Lebanon and it reiterates its support for the actions of the Secretary-General in that regard.Similarly  my country is concerned over the persistence of tensions and confrontations in areas of conflict in the Middle East. My Government supports the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; likewise  it recognizes Israel's right to have secure and recognized boundaries. It also urges Iran and Iraq to cease hostilities and to begin a process of pacification under the auspices of the united Nations.Recalling that one of the fundamental concepts of the United Nations is universality  my country supports the view that it is advisable that both Koreas become Members of the United Nations and expresses its gratification at the resumption of talks between them.The Government of Bolivia fully shares the concern of the international community concerning the pressing need to prevent and punish the illegal production  trade and use of illicit drugs  which represent a threat to public health and particularly to the health of the young  with the same determination  sense of responsibility and courage as my Government demonstrated as soon as it came to office in dealing with the economic and political realities in my country  it has now begun to use all the resources within its scope to wage a frontal war on the drug trade  with all the moral strength of its conviction that we must prevent the degradation of the dignity and worth of the human person  while at the same time preventing the institutional corruption which could jeopardize the very security of the State.By its very nature the drug trade has become an international criminal activity which accordingly urgently requires effective international measures accompanied by all the resources necessary to fight this crime against mankind. It is not reasonable to place the primary responsibility for the fight against this criminal activity on the producer countries  when it is known that production is in fact a function of the demand of the countries where the narcotic drugs are consumed. Bolivia  in its own interests  is prepared to strike at the root of the problems through a new conceptual and practical approach which would make it quite clear that the responsibility for the fight against the drug trade lies with the international community and that the major contribution must be made by the consumer countries.It is irrational to ask a country  embroiled in trying to find a solution to its economic problems at enormous economic sacrifices  at the same time to devote its meager resources to an isolated struggle against the drug trade. It must be acknowledged that economic and technical limitations may indeed affect the effectiveness of the fight against drugs. Notwithstanding its difficulties  though Bolivia is proceeding vigorously to eradicate non-traditional and surplus production of coca leaves as part of a comprehensive program set up as part of its international commitments.Bolivia  which is a nation severely hurt by this scourge  argues that the internationalization of the fight against the drug trade within the framework of the United Nations - and this was a proposal vigorously supported by the President of Venezuela  Mr. Jaime Lusinchi - can be one of the major achievements of the United Nations over the next decade  and would be one in keeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter. After all  the Charter is directed at promoting international co-operation in the solution of social and humanitarian problems as serious as the drug trade.In this context Bolivia firmly supports the convening by the United Nations of a ministerial conference in 1987 to consider the legal  institutional and educational ramifications of the illicit international drug traffic.In this connection  it is necessary to find new  imaginative and practical means for the international campaign against drugs. While on the subject  it would be useful to consider the setting up of an international economic fund  principally supported by the so-called consumer countries  and aimed at the purchase of coca leaves from their countries of origin in order to prevent the output of these coca leaves from falling into the hands of organized crime. At the same time  a world system to monitor production could be set up without damaging the economies of rural areas.This would be the most direct and immediate way of attacking the root of this evil in producer countries and could be combined with an active policy directed at finding substitutes for the production of the coca leaf.The international community is on notice that the maintenance of peace and the continuation of democracy depend on the development and well-being of the backward regions of our planet. When considering the world economic situation  however  we note that the 1980s may end as a lost decade for development  unless major economic measures are taken to relieve the crushing burden of external debt on the economic and social structure of many developing nations.The serious situation facing the majority of third-world countries  tied down by their debt-servicing obligations  has been emphasized. Statistics published by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  show that the external debt of those countries has risen  from $20 800 million to $310 000 million.As a graphic illustration of this  a recent report of the Inter-American Development Bank revealed that debt-servicing in Latin American countries represents twice the war reparations payments imposed by the Allies on Germany in 1919  which that country was compelled to repudiate in the 1920s. Recently  the Secretary- General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) reminded us that the foreign debt-servicing of Latin America totals more than 5 per cent of its gross domestic product. It is known that mere interest payments total more than $100 000 million a year.In the face of such a situation  Latin America notes with dismay the insensitivity of some developed countries and international lending agencies  which display unawareness of the social dimensions of the problem or whose actions are guided by purely mercantile criteria and are uninterested in seeking any other kind of solution.The various dimensions of the situation  taken together  make clear the urgent need for a reappraisal of policies which must be adopted forthwith if these problems are to be dealt with.Longer repayment time limits for developing countries are inoperative  as are lower or preferential rates of interest. This would involve a financial cost which would have to be met by the international financial community on the basis of criteria to be agreed upon. The re-staggering of debts over a period of years  the creation of international facilities to subsidize interest charges  and directly relating debt-servicing to the performance of international prices  without in certain cases ruling out a simple writing off of certain debts  are some of the direct measures which seem to be necessary factors in any lasting solution to the debt problem.However  whatever measures are taken to resolve the debt crisis  they will be insufficient to reactivate the development process if at the same time consideration is not given to joint action directed at stimulating development through an increased flow of funds to debtor countries. In this connection the change in emphasis announced by the United States with respect to Latin America's external debt could represent a turning point in the financial crisis besetting the region. It seems to indicate acceptance of the argument that policies directed at development will make it possible for the region to find more effective ways of meeting its enormous obligations deriving from Latin America's external debt  compared to the austerity policies required up to now by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The United States initiative would imply a less stringent regulatory policy followed by the IMF and use of the World Bank and commercial banks as suppliers of fresh funds making it possible for Latin American debtor nations to embark again on their economic development. Nevertheless  we are concerned that over the months to come a slowing down of the United States economy could have grave consequences for developing countries  which are still subject to the North's protectionist tendencies. These throttle their economies by limiting their export prospects and  consequently  their capacity to pay.The time has come  therefore  to take stock and to look at this matter in a serious and comprehensive way. Latin America is the only under-developed part of the Western world. Encouragement and assistance to its development is the only way to prevent the region from slipping into economic and social disarray. Anarchy in Latin America has always been the antechamber to dictatorship  and we have no alternative but to demonstrate  with concrete and swift examples  that democracy is able to liberate peoples from poverty and ignorance. The greatest and most decisive event in our century was the grandiose awakening of the new nations of Africa  Asia and America. The success of decolonization was  however  the result of a common international determination which emerged in the post-war period in the midst of the realities of colonial power. Cannot a similar international consensus bring about a far-reaching reform of world economic structures? Can the creditor nations not realize that  with each passing day  external debt becomes the most dynamic factor working for change in the world economic order  making peoples aware of the international injustice that prevails within the system? More than dogmas  myths and paradises  external debt is acting as the great catalyst of the will for change among peoples.This will is expressed here from this tribune of the nations   and is rising like an uncontainable tide. The dilemma at this difficult and dangerous time in international relations is clear: either the machinery of world power changes the rules of the economic game through a joint international exercise of will  such as prevailed after the Second world war to liquidate colonialism  or the world will be dragged into a financial holocaust which will not be without political implications.This holocaust is already under way. I am speaking now on behalf of a nation that lies right in the eye of this international crisis.Bolivia is the country that has the highest rate of inflation in the world. Had the Government headed by President Victor Paz Estenssoro not introduced a new economic policy  hyperinflation  according to estimates  could have amounted to more than 44 000 per cent this year. This single example in itself is indicative of the abyss into which my country could have fallen.For Bolivia the fall in the prices of basic export products due to the world recession meant a decline of approximately 20 per cent in its gross domestic product. If population growth and the negative impact of of inflation are taken into account  it can be stated that per capita national income fell by more than 30 per cent between 1983 and 1985.This economic contraction affected the most important social and economic sectors. Exports from the mining sector  which was in a steep decline  dropped by over 25 per cent as compared with 1977. The agricultural sector  which accounts for two-thirds of the population  experienced a similar drop over the same period. Urban unemployment and underemployment are at present the lot of approximately 40 per cent of the active urban population. Between 1982 and 1984 exports as a whole fell by 50 per cent  which was reflected in a sharp decline in the rate of domestic development.It was estimated that  at the end of 1984  Bolivia's public and private external debt amounted to $4 693 billion. Exports that year totaled approximately $780 million  whereas imports amounted to some $520 million. In the meantime  external debt servicing in 1984 had risen to a total of $804 million  a figure that the Bolivian State was materially unable to pay.What country could overcome so many calamities without political repercussions? However  Bolivia has preserved democracy  and once again the soul and spirit of the Bolivian people have withstood the test of adversity.""To dispel any false hopes  although not hope itself  which must be maintained to the full in order to meet the challenge posed by misfortune  we can state""  said President Paz Estenssoro  ""that there would be no point in living in a democracy if the people die of hunger"". In view of the fact that the country had been destroyed by poverty caused by the world recession which brought about a drop in the prices of the minerals it exports  it was incumbent upon the Government and people of Bolivia to reverse this economic trend. The inevitable alternative would have been a calamity of unimaginable proportions. Aware of thAs responsibility  my Government has implemented a new economic policy which implies austerity measures and adjustments  but which also presupposes the modernization and improvement of the production systems and resources available.President Paz Estenssoro put into words the determination of Bolivia  a country that does not give in and will not retreat one step in the face of forces that yesterday did not hesitate to destroy the country in order to destroy the system. In his view:""there is no formula for resolving the terrible crisis convulsing Bolivia other than the collective sum of moral values and constant labor which can increase exportable wealth. We must manage the scarce economic and financial resources properly  agree to a pause in the social struggle and convince ourselves that there can be no renaissance for the Republic unless we understand the scale of the catastrophe and the few effective remedies available to us to reverse this overwhelming situation."" It would be a sad irony if  at a time when Bolivia is making increasing sacrifices to help itself  the international community were to refuse to support my country in its efforts. My people are at present making tremendous sacrifices to overcome the crisis and to consolidate a democratic political community  we know that we are not alone  and that representatives gathered here and their respective Governments will transform this Assembly into the most active instrument for international co-operation and solidarity.On behalf of my country I express ray deep faith that the world will set aside its disputes and finally understand that peace is inseparable from the well-being of peoples  that poverty represents the denial of life and that there can be no worse dependency than poverty. Let us have the courage to proclaim that  as has been said here  we have not lost our faith in the ability to transform life and to transform the world  and that here in the United Nations after 40 years we have not lost the spirit of San Francisco  which in 1945 represented hope when the glow of victory seemed to light the way to a new dawn for mankind."
"19",950,"BRA",40,1985,"I still have before my eyes the suffering that Mexico has just undergone. I landed there to see for myself the tragedy  to see what had happened and to affirm to the people of that country Brazil's solidarity. In so doing  I dare to hope that I conveyed the feelings of the rest of the world  and I begin my statement here today by assuring Mexico of the solidarity of the entire world.This tribune instills respect and dignity. It is the loftiest in the community of nations. Here  both the mighty and the weak are diminished  so much greater is the burden of mankind's history in the exercise of the task which is the essence of the Organization's work - namely  the preservation of peace  tackling the problems that beset it and the efforts to transform divergences into solidarity.For 40 years my country  Brazil  has been privileged to open the general debate of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is with profound emotion that I now exercise that prerogative.Grave problems and immense responsibilities weigh heavily upon me. In expressing ray feelings I turn to the greatest poet of my land  and I do so because I believe that poetry is neither inappropriate nor anachronistic in the scenario of great debates. The poet wrote: ""What rare dream could be More pure or more beautiful And more profound than this Living machinery of the world?"" It is with this feeling about the world that I speak on behalf of one of the largest nations of the globe  a complex and dynamic society  the eighth largest economy in the Western world  a country of contrasts and of greatness - the Brazil made up of several Brazils  in which affluence and poverty  aridity and fertility  drought and flood create a geography of contradictory features and  in so doing  enclose in a vast continent a unified people who have known how to construct a racial democracy and a cultural unity that are the invincible force of their destiny.I am a simple man. I was born and have lived in one of the most severely tested regions of our land  the heavily populated and poverty stricken Brazilian north-east. I have followed a political career for 30 years  but it was in the midst of tragedy and awe  in an abrupt and unexpected way  that I was called upon to lead our nation.As President of the Republic  I am proud to be a writer for whom a taste for words has not restricted the spirit to mere aesthetic expressions. From words I forged an element of profound identification with the people  sharing in the aspirations of individuals and of society as a whole.Literature and politics force on us a social and humanistic vision of the universe. I cannot conceive of the pursuit of material gain without a spiritualsubstratum that endows human adventure with the dimensions of the eternal. I have faith  and woe unto the man who thinks of the world without the company of God.Brazil has just lived through a long night. Its eyes are not reddened by nightmares. Its lips display an open gesture of confidence and sing of its love for freedom. He who is a prisoner of the past cannot see the future. Hoses never turned his back on the Promised Land.The instrument that worked our transition from authoritarianism to democracy was our capacity to reconcile and understand  without violence or traumas. Our determination  courage and resilience were so strong that we managed to survive the loss of our hero  Tancredo Neves  on the very night in which our skies were lit up with the fireworks of victory. Our suffering then was transformed into strength and a resolve to make his dream our dream and to remain united.The values of transformation proved stronger than death  we applied those values to all classes of society  and  in so doing  we abolished distances and barriers in a patriotic convergence of all schools of thought and in the quest for the effective ideals of justice  conciliation and the institutional consolidation of civilian power. He believe that- social vision is the very life-blood of modern liberalism. Freedom concerns itself with actual living conditions  with the complete achievement of individual happiness  with universal franchise and with the right to be free.I come to this rostrum to pay a tribute to the United Nations on its fortieth anniversary. Brazil was there at its birth; it is here today  and it will be here in the future  to defend the spirit of the Organization.This spirit is not to serve as a mere instrument of the strong  but as the voice of the weak - of those who have neither armies  nor arsenals  nor a veto to impose in an effort to nullify decisions.I am here to say that Brazil no longer wishes its voice to be timid. Brazil wants to be heard - without aspirations to hegemony  but with a clearly determined presence  we shall not preach to the world what we do not say within our own borders  we are at peace with ourselves. Consistency has become our strength. Our domestic discourse matches our international stance. We wish  as of now  to give new life  with renewed emphasis  to our presence in the debate of nations  by espousing an independent  dynamic foreign policy aimed at resolving international issues which have a social content.We shall not be held captive by great Powers nor enslaved by minor conflicts.Forty years ago  our founding fathers established  despite the death throes of war and the ruins of oppression  the very foundations for the building of peace and the concert of nations  as well as unlimited co-operation among peoples. The major Powers and the emerging countries were called upon to put an end to colonial exploitation. They proclaimed to the universe the worth of the democratic principles of equality and justice. They condemned racism and intolerance. They gave legitimacy to the universal right to health  well-being and education. They reaffirmed the dignity of labour and the enhanced power of culture.At present  now that we have lived without a global conflict for twice the number of years allotted to humanity between the First and Second World Wars  we are in a position to state that the role played by the United Nations has not always been recognized; indeed  its performance has almost never measured up. Nevertheless  its role  far from b&ing useless  has been  is and will continue to be necessary. Its founding fathers were quite right.On behalf of Brazil  I congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I also congratulate the representatives of the Member States assembled here to commemorate the four decades of active existence of this Organization. I address my sincere compliments to the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  of whose talent and diplomatic experience we Latin Americans are so justly proud.It is only natural that the first topic I take should be that of Latin America. Latin America's extraordinary effort to create a democratic order is the most stunning and moving political fact of recent years  a fact that remains unacknowledged by the uncaring eyes of the center of world power. Little attention has been given to the institutional maturation of our region and to its drama and triumphs. With neither assistance nor interference  tempered only by the force of conviction  we have confronted the threats posed by the temptations of totalitarianism and by the greed of those who see only through the eyes of exploitation.We have emerged synchronized in a movement of solidarity towards the flourishing of free institutions. We have made our choice as one  irreversibly opting for the trinomial of open society  free institutions   dynamic economy. Using this threefold democratic definition as a basis  we shall pursue dialog as a bridge between the East and the West  the North and the South  old and new cultures  regimes and ideologies.Gandhi  the Mahatma  said that the true mission of the man of law is to throw a bridge across the abyss that separates adversaries. The United Nations is the law; we are the men of the law.New winds are blowing over our continent and are breathing new life into our democratic tradition  as reflected in commitments that preceded the creation of the United Nations.We therefore champion the principle of the self-determination of peoples and of toe duty of non-intervention  of the peaceful settlement of disputes and of the relaxation of East-West tension. We reject the sharp antagonisms of bloc politics. We advocate the primacy of negotiation over perilous demonstrations of force.In true democratic spirit  we have campaigned for many years on behalf of disarmament and we have shunned as precarious  violent and irrational the idea of a peace maintained by the parity of atomic arsenals. Brazil believe that there can be no quibbling over these ideals  nor can any concession be made to their suspension  at any level or for any reason whatsoever.It is also because of our loyalty to the universalist creed of democracy that we are anti-racist - profoundly  viscerally and intransigently anti-racist.Brazil is a great melting pot of a nation - one that is proud of its identity. Some of the most highly creative expressions of our culture come from racial mixture and from ethnic cross-fertilization. The greatest  most sensitive author we have produced  Machado de Assis  was a mestizo  as were also  in the plastic arts  the great baroque sculptor Aleihadinho  and in music  the world-renowned Villa-Lobos. I wish to remind the Assembly how much Brazil's popular culture owes to the genuis of the blacks and to the spirit of the American Indian.Brazil has determined that racial discrimination is not only illegitimate  but illegal; it is a crime covered by the penal code. We consider repulsive the upsurge of racial conflict dictated by racist intolerance or the persistence of colonial configurations. I solemnly reiterate our total condemnation of apartheid and our unreserved support for the immediate emancipation of Namibia under the aegis of the United Nations*He cannot conceive of the United Nations commemorating its age of reason without an all-out offensive against all the vestiges of racism on earth.As President of my country  I reconfirmed few weeks ago the ban on exports of oil and its by-products and of areas and ammunition and on licenses and patents to South Africa and I suspended all cultural  artistic or sports activities with the Government in Pretoria.Racism is against humanity and against the future. Racism  a different version of colonialism  which is both amoral and perverted  must not besmirch the golden page of decolonization.Decolonization will rise above the hecatomb of world conflicts and the sterile confrontations of the cold war as the greatest contribution of the twentieth century to the history of mankind.The success of decolonization was the result of the common international will  A similar search for consensus solutions will pave the way towards overcoming the frustration which we currently experience and which has been caused by the challenge of the arms race and the proliferation of tensions and conflicts.Human rights have a fundamental dimension which is intimately linked to the vary practice of coexistence and pluralism. The world that the creators of the League of Nations did not live to see  the structuring of which we still await  is a world of respect for the rights of the human person  such as the United Nations seeks to promote in the international covenants on human rights.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is undoubtedly the most important document signed by man in contemporary history  and it was born in the cradle of the United Nations.It is with pride and confidence that I announce to this Assembly Brazil's decision to accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. With these decisions the people of Brazil take a step towards the democratic affirmation of our State and reiterate to themselves and to the entire international community a solemn commitment to the principles of the Charter and the promotion of human dignity.In this task  I wish to stress the promotion of women's rights  which has gained new impetus in Brazil through the creation of the National Council for the Rights of Women  as well as the decisive participation of women in the transformations which are occurring in Brazilian society. This in turn is interrelated on the global level with the extraordinary movement of self-affirmation by women  the impact of which is causing a profound reappraisal of human relations as the century draws to a close.We are at one of the many crossroads that have marked .the 40 years of existence of the United Nations. The peoples are aware that concessions made to the realities of power are a one-way process. Only the united will of the majority to adopt a new attitude can remedy the scenario created by confrontation and by the mechanisms of power.""Not all is East or West in the United Nations ... The world has other cardinal points."" (A/PV.1208  para. 6) So said Ambassador Araujo Castro  who was representing Brazil at the eighteenth session of the General Assembly. Brazil recognizes many negative aspects in international relations  but we have always sought to view the world from a generous  multifaceted perspective.Let us use our time for co-operation and for science; natural differences should not now endanger coexistence. Celestial space has always been the purest image of peace. Let us preserve the infinite sky as a frontier that weapons must never violate.Brazilians believe in such values as respect for the individuality of each country and a united responsibility in the face of the impasses and dilemmas of this waning century.We witness with dismay the innumerable conflicts that affect the developing countries  paralyzing their efforts towards progress. These conflicts aggravate the difficult conditions created by the persistence of an unjust international order and place us at an even greater distance from the attainment of the ideal of peace and security. The transposition of themes from the East-West confrontation to the scenes of many of these conflicts adds a weighty element of exacerbation and disguises their true causes. We are surrounded by examples.Brazil associates itself with other Latin American countries in proclaiming the urgent need for a political  lasting and stable solution for the conflicts that are tearing Central America apart. It is for this reason that Brazil fully supports the Contadora initiative  which reflects the feelings of all Latin America in seeking a solution that will preserve peace and understanding on the continent in keeping with 'the will of the peoples of Central America.My Government joined with three sister nations in the creation of the Contadora support group in an effort to translate the broad backing that Contadora has been receiving into concrete initiatives.The political and deeply ethical character of the Contadora Group is the Latin American response to theories of confrontation; it supports dialog rather than radicalization; it is an invitation to substitute negotiations for the threat of the use of force; it is a vigorous defence of self-determination and ncn-interference against attests to internationalize the conflict.Brazil feels linked to all peoples in the Middle East by bonds of great friendship. The Brazilian society is greatly concerned about the disheartening atmosphere in Lebanon and recognizes the right of all peoples of the Middle East  including Israel  to live in peace within internationally recognized borders. Brazil wishes to see the creation of a national State of Palestine  this being the aspiration of that great people which has suffered for so long  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and acceptance of United Nations resolutions concerning the region.Brazil  which is linked to Iran and Iraq by growing ties of friendship and co-operation  exhorts those two countries to take a peaceful  negotiated route toward resolving their differences.He are very concerned about Afghanistan and Kampuchea. There will be no end to the violence in those countries as long as foreign troops remain there and as long as the right of their peoples freely to express their will is not explicitly recognized.It is also incumbent upon us to press for constructive vision and stance with regard to the question of the Malvinas. Since 1833  Brazil has given its support to the just Argentine claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  stressing that a negotiated settlement is the only way to resolve the problem.Brazil will make every effort within its power to ensure that the South Atlantic is preserved as an area of peace  shielded from the arms race  the presence of nuclear arras and any forts of confrontation originating in other regions.In keeping with its firm commitment to the effort to ban nuclear weapons from the continent  Brazil signed and ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco  whose pioneering goal is to transform Latin America into the first denuclearized zone on territory inhabited by mankind. The denuclearization of Latin America should be the first step in a new movement to deter the vertical and horizontal accumulation of nuclear arms  thereby releasing the $1.5 million squandered every minute on the arias race to be used to combat hunger  disease  ignorance and poverty.The marathon arms race is a symptom of the evil which threatens lucidity and is a sombre hiatus cm the human conscience.We are experiencing a new scientific revolution which is moment by moment transforming the world under our very eyes. Control over the advances which occur at dizzying speeds in state-of-the-art sectors of science and technology has become a vital matter of survival. The program of work of the United Nations in the next few years must contain a strategy to prevent the world from becoming fragmented into closed technological blocs; it must place scientific and technological knowledge at the service of the basic needs of all humankind.Those are the visible problems. But there is another  greater problem  one which permeates international relations and which insidiously threatens all  poor and rich alike - the poor  through destabilization; the rich  through insecurity; and everyone through the possibility of total collapse should we persist in our posture of immobility.I should like to address the economic problem  which concentrates its virulence in the third world  and in particular in Latin America. Crushed under the weight of an enormous foreign debt  the countries of the region are living through a scenario of severe difficulties with domestic repercussions resulting in recession  unemployment  inflation  increased poverty and violence. Ensnared in a vicious network of economic factors - namely  the rise in international interest rates  falling prices of commodities and the selectivity of markets in the developed countries - we are confronted with a crisis comparable only to that which assailed the market economies in the early 1930s.The burden of foreign debt imposes an economic policy geared towards achieving trade surpluses earmarked for interest payments. The international organizations propose policies involving inadequate adjustments. This approach leads to recession  to unemployment and to giving up the capacity to grow. Such a policy weakens civilian leadership  renders the social crisis explosive  threatens institutions  jeopardizes order and  as a result  constitutes a threat to democratic structures. To add to our difficulties  the markets of the developed countries are being closed to our exports. Protectionist barriers are proliferating and we are unjustly accused of unfair trade practices. The protectionism that is sought to shield the obsolete sectors of the. developed countries is even confused with the legitimate right of developing countries to create favorable temporary conditions for the installation of emerging industries incorporating modern technologies essential for sustaining growth in the exercise of our sovereignty and independence.And the paradox stems from the fact that all our efforts are being made precisely in an effort to transfer foreign exchange credits to the very quarters that beleaguer us and discriminate against us. we are thus caught between the threat of protectionism and the specter of default.We are doing our utmost to compete. Our firms export with meager profits and our labor force receives low wages. It is sad to have to confess that our minimum wage is $50 per month.To round out our difficulties  we are obliged to maintain a trade-balance surplus to pay  within four years  interest amounting to approximately $50 billion.That is the situation confronting a country which has potential  which has a broad and diversified range of exports comprising commodities and petroleum derivatives  manufactured goods  machinery and even aircraft. One can readily imagine the impact of these factors on other countries lacking our advantages.It has been our tradition to honor our foreign commitments. However  we have the obligation to alert the world to the fact that the existing scenario must be changed. It must be restructured  for it is unfair. And anything that harbors the germ of injustice or of the absurd simply cannot survive.Brazil has no desire to make an ideological issue of the matter of indebtedness  nor does it wish it to be transformed into a source of confrontation between North-South and East-West. Brazil is a country of ingrained Christian and Western ideals  we believe that wherever free enterprise has collapsed  freedom itself has likewise disappeared. Hence we believe in enhancing the world market through competition  and  in denouncing the present order  we are not moved by any political motivation. We wish solely and exclusively to defend our most sacred interests - the sacred interests of Brazil. And we shall fulfill this duty by urging the international community to join us in seeking a solution. Moreover  this solution cannot be based solely on the laws of the market.At the end of the Second World War  the victorious Powers understood that to achieve peace it was essential to establish a new disciplined international order to govern economic and financial relations among nations.Fundamental to the establishment of this economic order was the perception that rebuilding Europe was indispensable for stability and international security itself. The success of the program for the reconstruction of Europe demonstrates the ability to carry out projects of co-operation amongst nations when they are conceived with a broad vision of the reciprocity of interests involved and a clear awareness of the connection between political and economic problems.At present we are experiencing anew a situation which clamors for a creative vision for renewal. The pillars of the current order are eroded and obsolete. It is necessary for us to discuss concrete measures to adjust the international economic order to present-day realities.Following upon the period of prosperity  with the advent of the recession  it was Bobbes's predatory jungle which began to reign rather than the harmonious  fruitful anarchy of Adam Smith.The indebtedness of Latin America is no longer merely a regional problem  given the extent of its impact on the stability of the financial mechanisms of the Western world. Awareness of this problem led to the Cartagena consensus  a manifestation of solidarity amongst the Latin American countries most affected by the problem of foreign indebtedness  in an effort to devise a solution through dialog and understanding.From the Latin American point of view  it is imperative for the indebtedness crisis to be negotiated in terms of its political dimension. Today  just as was the case 40 years ago  the Governments of the creditor nations must be made aware of the fact that there is an exceptional situation the solution of which transcends tiie mere interplay of economic forces.In calling upon the leaders of the industrialized nations to come forward with concerted political action to resolve foreign debt problems  I do so with the serenity of a country which has not spared any effort to meet faithfully its international commitments.He have made gigantic efforts. Nevertheless  even if we were to maintain our current rate of growth  only in 1990 shall we have matched the per capita income level we had attained in 1980.Our people have reached the limits of what is bearable. It is impossible to demand additional sacrifices of a population as impoverished as ours. On the contrary  we must assure the Brazilian people that opportunities for employment will be increasing in the coming years.Our vulnerability to rises in international interest rates is so great that all we have accomplished will collapse if exorbitant rates are renewed.We shall face greater difficulties in shaping a liberal and pluralistic society if we do not maintain and expand our contacts abroad. However  the foreign debt crisis has been forcing our economy into a process of isolation and autarchy  resulting in minimal import possibilities and weakened and unsatisfactory ties with the international financial markets  we do not want isolation and autarchy; we have the right to expect of our international partners equitable and fair forms of co-operation and also that they will democratically accept a concrete share of responsibilities. We cannot rely merely on the rhetorics of economic adjustment  on the assumption that sacrifice is all that is required of a third-world debtor for the settlement of his foreign accounts. This narrow view disregards the fact that we are dealing with populations which have a right to a respectable standard of survival and with countries with legitimate national aspirations. Either we realize that the solution to the foreign debt problem is a joint task for creditors and debtors alike or we run the risk of setting fire to the powder-keg that threatens the whole continent.This picture explains the social cauldron of Latin America  defenseless against Messianic and demagogic seductions and the call of totalitarian ideologies and trapped in an unfair situation resulting from accumulated errors of the past. It is a miracle that the glow illuminating Latin America at this time comes from the torch of liberty and democracy and not that of turmoil.Brazil has taken its position. Debt does not lead to doubt. We have chosen to grow without recession  without submitting ourselves to those adjustments which would entail relinquishing development.Brazil will not pay its foreign debt with recession  nor with unemployment  nor with hunger. We believe that in settling this account at such high social and economic costs we would then have to surrender our freedom  for a debt paid with poverty is an account paid for with democracy. I thus wish to affirm with all seriousness and firmness that there is no solution possible without a thorough reformulation of the international economic structures.Lastly  I must speak of peace  the loftiest ideal of mankind. But what is peace? Is it merely the absence of war  of war between nations  of war between men? Or is peace something more transcendental which signifies the freedom of men from all forms of violence  from all forms of conflict? I believe it to be an inner state of mind projected by man as the conduct to be followed by all nations; but realistically we know that many generations vill pass before this goal is actually achieved.The reality that sustains us is quite different. The raw material of our work is provided by the harsh landscape of our times: one beset with violence  egotism  retaliation  dependence Jtwardness  servitude  nuclear war  the ills of starvation  cultural disparities  assaults on the ecology  pollution  terrorism  greed and exploitation.The peace of today is not yet true peace. It is war in disguise. The first path leading to peace is freedom; and the political organization of freedom is democracy. Free peoples do not wage war; there will be no war between democratic peoples that decide their own destinies without submitting to personal tyrannies and to ideological fanaticisms. War and democracy  war and freedom are incompatible terms. As Clausewitz pointed out  war exists only when sovereign States exist. Likewise  we can affirm that peaceful  consensual solutions prevail when free and democratically developed nations exist  with permanent institutions  with fully operational powers  and with the people themselves making the decisions. Thus the best way for the United Nations to work for peace is to work for democracy. We Brazilians follow this example. :e emerged from conflict through democracy. On the day the people felt that could decide  they did not choose violence. They opted for dialog  for negotiation.We are approaching the end of the century. The task of the United Nations has been to manage circumstantial conflicts. It is time for us to react vigorously against this marginal role  restoring to the Organization the prerogatives and rights deriving from its overall responsibility to all peoples in matters pertaining to peace and security.The priority for the fifth decade in the life of the United Nations should be a program of revitalization with the following objectives: to help defuse the tensions of the renewed confrontation between the two power blocs; to create a new economic order based on development and social justice; to explore the entire negotiating potential of the Organization to promote solutions for the regional conflicts which are proliferating in the third world; and to regain a major role in the negotiations for the reduction  control and elimination of arms  with emphasis on those with greater destructive power.However  freedom is not restricted to the exercise of a political right. As a component of the well-being of each of us we have a great social debt  a moral debt to the poor of the entire world who are the human beings we call brothers but whom we treat as though they were not.The meaning of freedom for contemporary man is not merely the absence of coercion or of interference. It is the prospect of a happy life for oneself and for one's own. Thence the concept of freedom which concerns itself specifically with the actual conditions of a free life and strives to promote the broadest possible equality of opportunity. Modern man is one whose life today reflects Jefferson's dream of the personal and collective pursuit of happiness.Equality of opportunity is the mainstay of social freedom  enabling the market to serve mankind rather than mankind serving the market. Without a diversity of values and multiple ways of life  freedom does not flourish  but languishes in privilege and drowns in oppression.Shortly before the creation of the United Nations  Churchill and Roosevelt held a dialog at Hyde Park. Roosevelt asked how peace could be assured and Churchill replied  ""By an Anglo-American alliance."" But Roosevelt retorted  ""No: by improving living conditions throughout the world.""I repeat  that for there to be peace there must be democracy and freedom: a freedom without hunger. The world cannot enjoy peace so long as there is a single hungry mouth anywhere on the face of the earth  a single child dying for lack of milk  a single human being suffering for lack of bread. The coming century will be the century of socialized food. The image of the mater dolorosa in the African desert is humiliating to us. Foodstuffs cannot continue to be mere speculative commodities on the exchange markets. Science and technology are here  announcing a new era of abundance through genetic engineering. Man  who has been able to break through the barriers of Earth and take off for the distant stars  cannot be incapable of eradicating hunger  what is required is a universal will to do so. That is a decision which must be taken without vetoes. It is urgent to have a plan of peace for the elimination of hunger.Brazil  which experiences the paradox of being a major producer of food while struggling to eliminate pockets of hunger from its own territory  is willing to take part with enthusiasm in an effort to mobilize the international community to wipe out the scourge of hunger before the end of the century. This challenge may prove to be an opportunity for the United Nations and its agencies to rise above the present discredited state of multilateralism  thus demonstrating their effectiveness and validity.In order to accomplish this  man must have a humanistic vision of politics  otherwise he may be able to think of nothing and produce nothing but nuclear missiles and warheads.The conquest of the seas brought to man the humanism of the renaissance. The conquest of the cosmos broadens our view to an infinite solitude: The world has become larger and yet at the same time smaller. We must be united on this voyage where all men are condemned to face the greatest temptations of life. The new humanism must be centered on solidarity and peace. Peace can exist only hand-in-hand with freedom  freedom with democracy  and democracy when we provide for the segregated  for the starving  for the unemployed. It will exist when in that poor nations we love our poorer regions  when in the rich nations we love the poor people  and when in the poorer nations we love the poorest people.Forty years ago we built upon the stark ruins of war. Today we must work to prevent the ruins of an anonymous war  which is hunger. Poverty is the very negation of life.This is the great mission of mankind: to transform life by transforming the world. The twenty-first century is in sight. Let us look upon the new times with the eyes of the lover of nature  with the eyes of the pursuer of dreams. Let us have the courage to proclaim that freedom and peace will spell the end of poverty and hunger."
"20",994,"BRB",40,1985,"My delegation wishes to add its congratulations to those already tended to Mr. de Pinies on his election as President of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.My delegation thinks it fitting that with his long and distinguished service to the international community he should have been chosen to be President of the General Assembly at this crucial moment in the history of the Organization. We look forward to his guidance and my delegation pledges its wholehearted support.The Government of Barbados also wishes to take this opportunity to commend his predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka of the Republic of Zambia  for the skill with which he guided the deliberations of the thirty-ninth session. Our congratulations are tinged with a sense of pride because of the special relationship which exists between him and the people of Barbados.At this point our thoughts turn to the agony of Mexico. Hardly had the business of this session begun when the people of Mexico suffered a most tragic experience involving substantial loss of life and extensive damage to property. The Government and people of Barbados extend their deepest sympathy to the Government and people of Mexico.Forty years ago five great States of the world  bruised and chastened by the collective savagery that was the Second World War  drew on the last remnants of human hope to create the organization which we specially honor this year. TheCharter they prescribed called for a new world order  noble in concept  edifying in its reach  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".Many of us here today represent the first of those succeeding generations to whom this promise was directed. Our verdict could well be influenced by the view that time appears to have stood still; that for today  despite the promise of 1945  this body stands almost neutralized by the events of the past 40 years and that  chastened in our turn  the members of my generation feel considerable diffidence about making promises to those who are to SuCCccu us. Forty years Forty years after Treaty of San Francisco  the scourge of war continues to carry pain and terror to many areas of the world.However  given the fact that those born at the end of the First World War matured just in time to offer their lives to the Second World War while those born at the end of the Second World War have been able to mature without the experience of a third world war  we might reasonably conclude that the United Nations has achieved much more than its critics are prepared to admit.In addition this generation has benefited from the eradication or control of several serious diseases as a result of the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO); from improved education  scientific advances and cultural expansion resulting from the efforts of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); from increased yields  better food production and a greater appreciation of nutrition as a result of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); and from a generally improved quality of life as a result of the collective efforts of this Organization and the specialized agencies.What has not materialized  however  is the co-operation among the great Powers so confidently anticipated by the founding fathers. We ask ourselves: what explains this?Writing under the darkening clouds of the Second World War  a young American  Thomas Wolfe  had these words to say:""I think the enemy is here before us... I think we know the forms and faces of the enemy... and in the knowledge that we know him and must eventually conquer him is also our living hope. I think the enemy is single selfishness and compulsive greed.""lit similar vein a famous American cartoonist had one of his characters say  ""I have seen the enemy  and he is us"".In the President's inaugural address to this session he struck this very note  reminding us that the crisis of the United Nations is not to be charged to any delinquency in the Organization but rather to the selfishness of Member States.For all-this  the Organization has had an impressive record over the past 40 years. This anniversary would be a fitting occasion to rededicate ourselves to the noble aims and ideals which motivated the founding of the Organization. Barbados will continue to give strong support to the Organization and to identify with those who see it as the conscience of the world.One of the most striking developments in world affairs since the end of the Second world War has been the emergence of the mini-State. Their noble preceptsnotwithstanding  the founders of our Organization could scarcely have intended that within two decades  of indeed at any time  a country of 200 000 souls would stand beside another of 200 million to pronounce itself itself with equal sovereignty and authority on all matters that most concern us as members of the world's community. This  coupled with the fact that many more States now demand a fair share of the world's resources  constitutes the greatest challenge facing this Organization and the Charter on which it is based.We who speak for the small States know that the idea of the sovereignty of nations like Barbados has not yet taken firm root in the minds of some of the larger and older members of this body.By permitting the amplification of our voice to the level of those who would overwhelm us  the united Nations helps to preserve for small States the sovereignty which they have so recently won. As Dag Hammarskjold noted so very perceptively in a statement to this Assembly on 3 October 1960  25 years ago to the very day  it is the snail States that need the United Nations for their protection.""In this sense"" he continued  ""the Organization is first of all their Organization and I deeply believe in the wisdom with which they will be ableto use it and guide it."" (A/PV.883  para. 11)Medical science informs us that on the approach of the fortieth year the human system undergoes certain physiological changes which may sometimes result in erratic behavior. It would appear that the international system is also subject to this form of adjustment.The Caribbean has learned from harsh experience that multilateral co-operation is vital to the survival of small States. The Government of Barbados is alarmed at what appears to be a growing tendency among some of the most powerful members of the international community to resile from the commitment to multilateralism which is the very foundation upon which the United Nations rests. The signs are many and ominous: hesitancy on the part of some developed States to accede to the Convention on the Law of the Sea despite its potential for enormous benefits not only for small States like those in the Caribbean but indeed for all mankind; the decision of some governments to withdraw from the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the failure of the international community to match their stated commitment to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) with the required level of pledges and contributions; the willingness  or indeed the determination in some quarters  to witness the demise of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) - an institution that has served and continues to serve small developing countries with credit in the areas of training and research.a large number of countries  among them my own are persuaded that it is necessary for institutions to adapt to changing times in order to carry out their mandates effectively  and the international community should periodically initiate reviews of all of the multilateral institutions which serve it. It is one thing  however  to undertake an examination and diagnose an illness  but quite another to administer a potion  the result of which is likely to be death.Then there is the North-South dialog. Discussions and consultations have so far been disappointing. This is due in large measures to the lack of genuine willingness and honest commitment on the part of some governments to find an acceptable approach to redressing the inequities in the international economic system. He can only hope that recent efforts by the richest nations to solve problems among themselves will result in a greater appreciation of our difficulties and the need for a new international economic order.One of the most striking of the phenomena - or symptoms  if you like - of what I might call the new international malaise is what is known as ""graduation"". It refers  as members of the Assembly knew  to the process by which countries that have reached a certain point in their development are called upon to shoulder a proportionately greater responsibility for that development.Nothing would appear to be more reasonable. There is not a country represented in this Organization which would not willingly  indeed joyfully  welcome its own evolution towards self-sustained development.But the problem is that this ""admirable principle"" is now being applied according to a set of crude arithmetic formula  invented and applied unilaterally  rather in the manner of the infamous Procrustes  who stretched or broke the limbs of his guests to fit them to the length of his bed. Thus  regardless of the paucity of a country's natural resources  regardless of the fragility of its economy  any country that makes the mistake of managing its affairs with a modicum of prudence is in grave danger of being ""graduated"".In practical terms this means that it is excluded from access to most forms of concessional financial aid  even though its total budget may be less than that of a large department in a metropolitan city. It bespeaks an insensitivity to reality that is unworthy of our international fraternity.But what is perhaps the most important feature of this policy of graduation based on the automatic application of an arbitrary formula is the implied suggestion that whenever a State is seen to rise above the level of its barest minimum it should be repressed and thus discouraged from aspiring to become a donor rather than a recipient.As has been made clear by many of the speakers who preceded me in this debate  the international community is faced with a major crisis relating to the massive debt which is owed by developing countries to institutions  both public and private  in the developed countries. There is a growing consensus that the very nature of the problem transcends the realm of simple profit-and-loss accounting. The idea of default offends many governments  including my own  despite the role which default has played in the growth of a number of countries now among the world's wealthiest.It is our fear that should the developed countries not hearken to the pleas of their poorer neighbors  initiatives not hitherto contemplated may be taken by those who become desperate. What some in the developing world may  with good reason  interpret as acts of economic aggress ion could lead to acts of economic retaliation  and to a cycle of behavior which can only place in jeopardy all that we have come to accept as the norms of international conduct.Developing countries want to earn whatever benefits there are to be derived from the international system. Their primary interest lies in the availability of more open and dependable avenues for trading. They are concerned about the rush by some States to adopt protectionist policies which are counter-productive since they arrest the commercial potential of developing States and must in the end render them more susceptible to the state of dependence from which developed States would profess to deliver them.The potential of small inland developing countries is circumscribed. It has not been their fortune to have at their disposal the abundance of resources  human and material  with which their larger neighbors have been endowed. These countries  the peculiar nature of their problems notwithstanding  are unable to convince the industrialized world of the need for an appropriate regime. It is difficult  and in some cases perhaps impossible  for such countries to advance when arguments for special consideration in the light of their very special and difficult circumstances continue to be ignored.This fortieth anniversary also coincides with International Youth Year  now being observed by the United Nations. It is important that the attention of the international community should be redirected to the interests of the world's youth  particularly at a time when for many of them the international traffic in narcotic drugs  and drug abuse  threaten to destroy their future or  at the very least  stunt their development.Concern for the menace posed by drugs is being expressed in many forums. Already in this session we have heard the anxiety of many representatives. Indeed resolutions 39/141 and 39/143 are evidence of a firm intention on the part of the General Assembly to confront and eradicate the problem of illicit drugs.The Caricom Secretariat is now in the process of compiling  for use by ail regional governments  information with respect to drug trafficking  transshipment  abuse and rehabilitation as it relates to the Caribbean.The problem of illicit drugs is an international problem and can only be resolved through co-operative effort  particularly in the sharing of information among all members of the international community.Another serious problem that requires attention is the problem of terrorism.Small countries like Barbados have perhaps less to fear from terrorists than from mercenaries  for unless they are prepared to support large military establishments they are always exposed to the risk of destabilization by a band of efficient and well-armed mercenaries. However  no responsible member of the international community can fail to view with abhorrence the wanton acts of terrorism which are visited from time to time on innocent by-standers. No comfort should be given either to the terrorist or the mercenary  and the time has certainly come when the nations of this world should act resolutely to eliminate both these scourges.Four years ago my predecessor  speaking from this podium  called on the Organization ""... to end the charade  to close ranks and to move with dispatch to bring the South African Government to its senses  or to its knees ..."". (A/36/PV. 11  p. 57)The racist regime has left no doubt in anyone's mind that it will not come to its senses. Recent events have clearly demonstrated that it is on its way to its knees. Internal unrest and external pressure are now showing what concerted action on the part of the international community could achieve if influential friends and allies of the South African Government would tailor their actions to suit the views that they profess.Public protestations of abhorrence of apartheid must be matched by concrete action to end the barbarous and brutal methods used to entrench the evil system of apartheid.My delegation notes with relief the recent actions taken by many democratic countries to show without the shadow of a doubt that it is completely inadmissible to do business as usual with South Africa. My delegation also hopes that those misguided apologists who have defiantly boasted of their determination to launch a quixotic campaign in support of apartheid will not only fall flat on their faces  but in the process arouse such indignation among civilized people everywhere as to lead to the speedy dismantling of the odious system of apartheid.My delegation expects the struggle against apartheid to receive a significant boost with the adoption at this session of the draft international convention against Apartheid in sports  it is a source of great satisfaction to us that the Ad Hoc Committee has finally been able to complete its mandate and to recommend adoption of the draft convention. The Committee  in which Barbados played a very active role  has worked for many years on this important and difficult undertaking. By dint of hard work  serious consultation and negotiation  and goodwill the draft convention (A/40/36) has emerged  to help the international community tighten the stranglehold on apartheid.We utterly reject the notion that a man should be considered less than a human being because the color of his skin is black.And in Namibia  the racist regime of south Africa continues to ignore the will of the international community and to deny the people of that country the right to self-determination. My delegation regards the liberation of Namibia from its South African oppressors as an urgent matter and hopes that no further comfort will be given to the oppressive South African regime by confusing the rights of the Namibian people with extraneous political issues.As if this were not enough  neighboring countries continue to suffer violations of their territorial integrity at the hands of that hateful regime. Nothing perhaps better demonstrates the need for co-operative effort by the world's powerful nations  as envisaged in the Charter  than the fact that the illegal and racist regime in Pretoria with its mighty war machine need fear no retaliation from the relatively unarmed States within its reach.The situation in Central America is of obvious concern to Barbados. The Government of Barbados has joined its Caribbean neighbors in reaffirming its support for the Contadora process and once more calls upon all parties concerned to refrain from any action which would undermine this vital initiative  rooted as it is in the principle that the problems of the region should be resolved in a manner conducive to peace and stability in the hemisphere. To this end  the freely exercised co-operation of the countries immediately concerned is indispensable.As regards the Middle East  the Government of Barbados reiterates its conviction that the question of Palestine is central to this conflict and that lasting peace in the region cannot be established until the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to a homeland  are respected. We reaffirm our support for Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which cites as essential to a viable settlement the withdrawal of Israel from occupied territories and recognition of the right of all States to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.My delegation is happy to report that Barbados participates in the Regional Plan for Action for the Integration of Women in the Economic and SocialDevelopment of Latin America and the Caribbean and the Plan of Action of the Inter-American Cocasissian of Women. Our participation in the raid-decade Conference in Copenhagen and the end-of-the-decade Conference in Nairobi further demonstrates our commitment to the integration and development of women at the regional and international levels.On the domestic front  my Government has employed legislative and other measures to ensure that women enjoy the same rights and privileges as men within our society.We must not forget that this fortieth anniversary coincides with the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki accords on human rights or that  despite the lofty Helsinki promise  much of the world's population today enjoys no real political rights. The question of human rights is the question of human tolerance and reflects what is too often the consequence of our refusal to compromise. Thousands of men  women and children in every corner of the globe suffer because of their religious or political views  the color of their skin  or even the spelling of their names. Torture  imprisonment and executions without due process are still too prevalent in our world.We regard it as an essential purpose of this Organization that the world community should be assisted in identifying  establishing and maintaining a universal regime of human rights. It is not an easy task. Among the 159 nations which this body comprises many cultures are to be found  many values  many perceptions of the nature and purpose of man  of society and of government. In its attempt to bring together the diversity that is this universe  the founders of this Organization set themselves and their successors a daunting responsibility  one that can only be accomplished through persistent and painstaking dialog. We cannot afford to tire. We cannot afford to fail.There is no question but that much that is good has occurred in the world during the past 40 years. In the sciences - in industry arid agriculture - in the arts  the human mind has risen to unprecedented heights. He have split the atom) we have created the computer and the satellite; we can plumb the depths of the ocean; we have outstripped the speed of sound; we have put to flight many of the lethal diseases which stalked and shortened the life of man; communications technology makes it possible for virtually every corner of the world to establish contact with another.Moral excellence has not always been wanting. Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther Ring confirmed to us that transcendent quality of the human spirit and its capacity for courageously confronting anything that imperils our welfare.In our material and spiritual spheres  therefore  we have demonstrated an ability to find the answers and the solutions to problems with which mankind has long been burdened. Yet  despite this knowledge  selfishness and greed continue to poison our lives. Despite the enormous riches of this world  millions are impoverished; despite the abundance of food produced  thousands die daily from hunger.Billions of dollars are each year committed to the perfecting and storage of weapons for meaningless war  while small countries are bowed down with debts in their efforts to bring their people a modicum of human integrity.The fact is that  despite our magnificent and commendable achievements  we seem unable to discern the rudimentary fact that we are our brothers' keepers.We all know that as long as injustice exists there will be no peace. As long as there is an unfair distribution of this world's resources; as long as one race dehumanizes another; as long as innocent men  women and children remain homeless and stateless; as long as one country exploits another; as long as one-half of the world is free and the other shackled  whether it be by hunger  by disease or by terror of arms  there will be no peace. As long as the large and the strong regard the small and the weak with contempt there will be tension in this body and disorder in the world.Against this gloomy canvass  we feel impelled to paint the words of our esteemed Secretary-General  a man who has devoted untiring energy to the welfare of our Organization. In concluding his report dated 4 September 1985  he exalted us: ""Let us above all  on this occasion  look at the United Nations as its founders looked at it  as the practical hope for the future and not merely as the unhappy bearer of the burdens of the past."" (A/40/1  p. 16)"
"21",1026,"BRN",40,1985,"Mr. President  I should like on behalf of the delegation of Brunei Darussalam to express say warmest congratulations to Mr. Jaime de Pinies on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. With his vast experience in the activities of the United Nations and his undoubted diplomatic skill  I am confident that he will ably manage the proceedings and affairs of this Assembly.At this point  allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the outgoing President  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the competent and able manner in which he presided over the work of the last session.On this occasion of commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  I wish to reaffirm the commitment of Brunei Darussalam to the United Nations and the principles of its Charter. The United Nations  and its Charter have stood the test of time. There are many who have criticized the United Nations as being ineffective. Some have even suggested that its days are numbered  and some others say that it has become irrelevant  we agree that it has not always been effective  but what international body of the size of the United Nations is really effective? And who is ultimately responsible for making this body effective? True  the United Nations record in the performance of its primary function to maintain international peace and security has been deficient. But can we really blame the United Nations for this?We do not belong to the rank of the pessimists. We do not judge the United Rations as a failure. We like to look at its records of successes! its peace-keeping efforts in Cyprus  the Congo and elsewhere is a pride and a light of hope to many of us. The United Nations has also done well in other areas; in humanitarian efforts helping the refugees  in the eradication of smallpox  its work in child welfare and many others. Surely these stand out as success stories.The ineffectiveness of the United Nations in the performance of its primary function can be attributed to the lack of political will of its Member States to act positively in accordance with the purposes of the United Nations. It is this positive attitude which the Members must adopt. The United Nations can do no more than what the Members are prepared to do. Therefore we  the Members  must recognize that it is our solemn duty to deliver what we all promised when we joined this august body.Even though its performance does not meet the highest expectations of many  yet due largely to its existence the world has not been struck by another disastrous global war. It is still a relatively safe world. It is true  the situation in the world today is far from perfect. But has it ever been perfect? There have always been conflicts and there will always be conflicts  so long as people do not respect the legitimate rights of others. The United Nations provides in its Charter principles for the development of friendly relations among nations based on the sovereign equality of States. If leaders of this world are fully committed to those principles  we can be spared from the misery and sufferings that are brought about by regional conflicts which most unfortunately still persist: the Iran-Iraq war  the problems in Lebanon  foreign intervention in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Despite all these we recognize that the United Nations has done a good deal of work in easing international tension. Is this not the aim of the United Nations Charter? The preservation of world peace is the common responsibility of all nations  big and small alike  it requires them to refrain from the threat or use of force. It requires a commitment that States resort solely to peaceful means in the settlement of disputes. This is our responsibility as Members of the United Nations and as leaders of our respective countries.In a world where peace is precarious  it has been shown that our destiny is interdependent. What happens in one corner of the world will affect everyone. It is therefore vital that on this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  all Members reaffirm their commitments to the United Nations and its Charter principles and ensure that the United Nations must work for what it is created for: to save humanity from the scourge of war  ensure freedom and justice and above all to ensure that the United Nations will continue to be relevant when we reach the twenty-first century.It is sad for me to say that continued conflicts are still present in several parts of the globe. In South-East Asia  the problem in Kampuchea remains unresolved. Vietnamese forces continue to occupy Kampuchea and Viet Nam continues to show no flexibility. Despite all these  Viet Nam repeatedly claims that it sincerely desires to live in peace with its neighbors. But it appears that its words are different from its deeds. Indeed> if Viet Nam is genuinely serious  then it should act in accordance with the spirit and the principles of this body. It should immediately take steps to implement the various United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea.Many who have spoken before me said that the creators of the United Nations have created a set of goals and ideals far too high for it to be achieved. But the men and women who set up this Organization 40 years ago this month are among the great statesmen of the century. They have set the goals knowing full well that the world's nations probably would fall short of those high ideals. They must also have known and realized that the setting of the. high goals is a necessary precondition in order that their pursuit and attainment is worthwhile. It remains a challenge to us all. The Charter speaks of freedom and sovereign equality. It speaks of fundamental human rights and it also speaks of tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbors.Speaking of freedom  we know that this is where we fall far short of our objectives. We need to put pressure on those who refuse to respect this fundamental aspect of the principles of the Charter. Speaking of freedom and equality  we immediately focus our attention on South Africa. The aspirations of the majority for freedom  equality and democracy cannot be suppressed. The racist South African regime must realize that the whole international community is against it. South Africa must see  and be made to see  that it cannot suppress those legitimate aspirations by force for ever. The international community condemns the practice of apartheid. Change is inevitable. Apartheid has no place in the world anymore. It has to go.Talking of freedom and democracy also brings our attention to the struggle for independence of the Namibian people. We have always supported the people of Namibia in their struggle for liberation. The occupation of Afghanistan by foreign forces which enters its sixth year is also a matter which is always attracting attention. Brunei Darussalam always believes in the principle that foreign intervention of a sovereign country cannot be condoned. Nor can we tolerate foreign aggression. We support the call of the international community for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan. The war has caused untold misery and suffering to the people of Afghanistan. Millions of them have been forced to seek refuge in the neighboring countries. This in turn causes immense problems for the countries concerned.Closely associated with the problem in Afghanistan  is the repeated incursions of foreign forces into Pakistani territory. Those violations are in direct contravention of the very principles we all value and cherish  the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter: respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations. Brunei Darussalam therefore joins other nations in calling for an immediate halt to those incursions.I should fail in ray duty today if I did not mention the question of the Palestinians. We have always supported the principle of the inalienable right of a people to have a home. We therefore continue to lend our support to the call for recognition of the Palestinians' right to establish their own independent and sovereign State in their own territory. The Palestinians problem  we believe  can be solved only by the unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967  including Jerusalem.In spite of all these gloomy situations  there are some encouraging signs in other parts of the globe. Brunei Darussalam welcomes the recent developments and the many contacts between North and south Korea. We believe that the direct contacts could lead to a reduction of tension in the peninsular and hence contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region. The people of North and South Korea must be allowed to resolve their own problems in their own way. In keeping with the principle of universality  they could  if they so desired  become Members of the United Nations  without prejudice to reunification.The world is also beset by problems of a non-political nature. Drug abuse and illicit trafficking is one such problem; indeed  it has become a global problem. The security implications are serious. It causes suffering to individuals  particularly the young  it weakens the social fabric of nations. It represents direct and indirect economic costs to Governments. It entails criminal activities which could threaten the stability of States. It is now becoming more urgent for concerted international action to combat the threat that drug abuse and illicit trafficking pose to the international community. We welcome the proposal of the Secretary-General before the plenary meeting of the Economic and Social Council that a world conference on narcotic drugs be convened at ministerial level in 1987.Such a conference would provide the added impetus and necessary political mandate for accelerated action in combating the international drug problem.I cannot end this statement without mentioning the greatest peril facing the world today  that of the threat to the survival of mankind from nuclear war. The escalation of the nuclear arms race  both in amount and in type  has heightened the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war. It has led to greater insecurity and instability in international relations. As a small nation mindful of our responsibility and conscious of our vulnerability  we welcome the continuation of bilateral negotiations between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. We are concerned over the outcome of the negotiations and we hope that those negotiations will produce concrete and effective agreements to prevent an escalation of the arms race and the beginning of an arms race in outer space.I wish to conclude by reaffirming that Brunei Darussalam will always support this Organization. The United Nations is the forum in which all States  big and small  can make their contribution to fostering peace  security and well-being in the world."
"22",1154,"CAF",40,1985,"Our organization is 40 years old. It has come of age. And the world should celebrate a happy anniversary today  in exalting the lofty ideals of peace and security  harmony and co-operation among nations. But the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations will take place in a particularly uncertain  tense and sombre atmosphere  in which the United Nations is prevented from acting effectively by the unimaginable consequences of war and the difficulties and adversities of the present.However  through its vital and dynamic character  the Charter could have helped to cope with future changes. Things have not always been as they are  as the state of the world shows  which sometimes reminds us of the climate which prevailed on the eve of the second world conflagration. The coalition that was formed to defend the cause of freedom quickly broke up due to the strains of the struggle. Freedom itself rightly belongs to every man and every people  freedom for which so many men and women  regardless of race or religion  have fallen  is only the result of bargaining  if not outright conquest  often at a heavy price for some peoples of Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America.When we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  it is as if  with respect to the fate of the Namibian people and the South African people  the international community should merely confine itself to a ritual condemnation of the absurdity of occupation and apartheid practiced by the Pretoria regime.Namibia must gain independence unconditionally. The courageous action being carried out at present can promote the democratization of South African society and the emergence of racial equality.The Palestine question  which is at the heart of the situation in the Middle East  is not improving either. The Republic of Central Africa  believes that the Palestinian people must enjoy all their inalienable rights  including the right to a homeland. In the same way  all States in the region must live in secure and recognized boundaries.The situation in Democratic Kampuchea calls for an overall solution that would guarantee the withdrawal of all foreign forces and respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kampuchean people and their right to self-determination without any outside interference.The legitimate aspirations of the Korean people to peaceful and independent reunification of their country  and the admission  in the meantime  in the interest of the universality of the world Organization  of the two Koreas  whether simultaneously or not  still cannot be realized owing to the threats to peace in the region.Co-operation among nations in accordance with the Charter  which was intended to prevent return to the prewar conditions chafe had led to the breach of the peace under the League of Nations  also quickly gave way to contempt and indifference  so that today what we are witnessing is a genuine crisis of multilateralism. Thus  the third-world countries are confronted with many difficulties which could not have been foretold from the development of the international situation. These factors can only jeopardize the reign of peace and security desired by the founding fathers of the United Nations. That is the reality of the world at this moment as we gather to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nation But  no matter how bitter this reality may be  we should not give way to excessive pessimism  because there is at least one reason for satisfaction. It is that the United Nations exists and that the peoples of the world feel that its existence is necessary.It is not for us to draw up a detailed balance sheet of the 40 years of existence of the United Nations  to condemn it for its failures when so much was expected of it or to give our stamp of approval when it had distinguished itself by positive action. It is much more important to determine  based on what exists  what can be done to improve things - that is  how the United Nations can play its role in a world which  we all agree  is in the course of profound change.This can only begin with consideration of the future of the Organization.However  before inviting this Assembly to consider this  I wish  on behalf of the delegation of the Central African Republic  to congratulate Mr. Jaime de Pinies on his election to the Presidency of this session of the creation of our Organization  in which the people of the Central African Republic place so much hope. His experience as a statesman and his prodigious knowledge of international affairs are a sure guarantee of the success of our work. He can rest assured that our delegation is ready to co-operate fully with him. •As for his predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  we wish once again to express our thanks to him for presiding so successfully  and in a particularly difficult international context  over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.Finally  the determination and dedication with which the Secretary-General  . Javier Perez de Cuellar  serves the cause of the Organization has won our admiration and support.We have been able to measure the path traveled by the United Nations in its 40 years of existence and also to highlight what has prevented it from fully  attaining the objectives assigned to it by its supporters through the Charter. Customs  events  interests and privileges of yore continue to frustrate the spirit of the Charter and sometimes  in certain situations  we have found that there have been several interpretations of its relevant provisions. The vision of a better world based on the application of the Charter - that is  on the preservation of peace and international security  understanding and better relations among peoples - can only be distorted by this.Thus  the United Nations is confronted with a series of problems which will have a profound effect on its future. Blackmail  intimidation  subversion  terrorism  the division of the world into blocs  the absence of democracy in relations between States  the unbridled arms race and unequal development  because of their implications  are a permanent threat to peace. As for development  how can we imagine that the United Nations can accomplish its mission while two thirdsof mankind  because of their condition  are virtually deprived of the right to development and thus the right to life.When we look at the economic conditions of the third-world countries  and particularly those of Africa  the first question which comes to mind is why there has been such a retardation of their development. There are various answers.It is  however  certain that the future of the economy of those countries is in their own hands and that they are primarily responsible for taking action in this area. They have understood this and on the basis of coherent planning are mobilizing their resources in a rational manner. They have also understood that the improvement of their situation  in view of the fact that in economic terms they are often very small  requires efforts not only at the national but also at the subregional  the regional and even the continental level. That is the case in our subregion of the Economic and Customs Union of Central Africa and the Economic Community of Central African States. Meetings organized under each of these bodies clearly highlight the fact that the question of development is at the center of the concerns of those countries. Unfortunately  the success of all these efforts is uncertain.Hunger  sickness  malnutrition and illiteracy continue to be the daily lot of the majority of the people of the third world. The various strategies adopted to achieve a minimum of development are often doomed to failure  derailed in many cases by the combined and cumulative effects of the international economic crisis  the unjust and inappropriate structure of the present economic system  the decline in export revenue  the difficulty of access to sources of financing and the stagnation of official development assistance.Some of these countries  particularly those of Africa  are confronted with a new problem: drought and desertification.The solution to these problems goes beyond the national and regional level  because the economic trends are much more intense between developing countries on the one hand and developed countries on the other than in the relations between developing countries. This solution can only be found through co-operation on the international level  where the United Nations provides  the main forum and a framework.It is necessary for the developed countries  in a spirit of solidarity and social justice  to help to sustain the development efforts of the least developed countries. This should be done  first  by giving effect to the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  which have established the genuine right to development of the economically backward countries and have set the guidelines for it. Since financial aid plays an important role in the process of the acceleration of development  the industrialized countries should also make efforts to increase official development assistance. They should also give financial support to United Nations activities of interest to the third-world countries  such as the program for the universal immunization of children  to which some countries - and the Central African Republic would like to take this opportunity to thank them - have contributed substantially. There can be no doubt that this action  which should be widely supported by the developing countries  can only further the campaign to ensure the survival of children.Particular attention should also be given to the demands of the third-world countries for the initiation of global negotiations with their partners of the Northern Hemisphere on a redefinition of international economic relations on a completely new basis.Finally  there is the question of foreign indebtedness  because if nothing is done by the international community of which the countries of the third world  and those of Africa in particular  can no longer have any hope of participating in development. We consider it necessary  therefore  that an international conference be convened to examine this question. Such a conference would reaffirm the principle of repayment of private debts and envisage the possibility of transforming into grants the public indebtedness  the blame for which  from the historical point of view  falls partly on the developing countries.The usefulness of an Organization like the United Nations depends upon the interest invested in it by its Member States and upon their will to ensure it has the means necessary to carry out its mission. It also depends upon the use such States make of the various mechanisms provided under the Charter to bring about co-operation  understanding and good relations among States on the basis of law and through a collective defense of peace.Any thoughts about the future of such an Organization obviously entail study of its ability to adapt itself to changing times and  at the same time  an attempt to strengthen its means of action in every area of international life  and especially with regard to areas in which its intervention has hitherto been limited. These include the question of Charter revision and the development of third-world countries.May this commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization provide us an opportunity to renew our faith in the Charter and reaffirm our will to uphold its purposes and principles. That is the wish of His Excellency Andre Kolingba  President of the Republic and Head of State and Government  who wishes us great success in our work."
"23",1198,"CAN",40,1985,"On behalf of Canada  I congratulate you. Sir  on your election as President of this milestone session of the General Assembly. Your long career of devotion to the principles of the United Nations is recognized by this election  as is the vitality of the democratic institutions of the Government you represent.On behalf of Canada  I join other spokesmen in expressing grief at the suffering caused by the massive earthquakes in Mexico. In connection with this tragedy we have seen arising spontaneously across national boundaries a rallying of forces to complement the Mexican Government's own extraordinary rescue operations. In times of such natural disasters the world truly becomes a neighborhood  and our people extend both their prayers and their practical help. We were pleased to join yesterday in the consensus on the resolution adopted in this Assembly expressing our common solidarity with the Mexican people.It would be remiss of me as a Canadian if I did not sadly recall that last week Canada and the United Nations lost one of our greatest soldiers and statesmen  the late General E.L.M. Burns. Canada is particularly proud that he was the first commander of the united Nations Emergency Force and that he was a practical architect of peace-keeping. General Burns was also one of Canada's most thoughtful proponents of disarmament. His contributions truly embodied the best ideals of the Charter  we mourn his passing  but in reflecting on his dedication to the high principles and purposes of the united Nations we find an example that is inspiring for the years ahead.At the age of 40 some people have what is termed a mid-life crisis  but this description certainly does not apply to the United Nations. There may be multiple crises in the world system today  but at the age of 40 the United Nations is a long way from mid-life. In fact  viewed in the long range of history the United Nations is still very much in its early years.This perspective helps us to establish a more balanced and fair assessment of the United Nations in this important anniversary year. Optimists would like to see the United Nations as the flowering of a world that has come together. Pessimists decry it for not having brought peace. Realists recognize that the United Nations has persisted successfully in its global strategies for human security despite the divisions among nations.In its first 40 years the United Nations has made an inestimable contribution to building a framework for a global system that responds to the technological interdependence and vulnerability of modern society. Technology has revealed the common qualities of the entire human family. Everyone wants to avoid the scourge of war. Everyone wants the opportunity for economic development. Everyone wants the guarantee of full human rights. The tackling of these common demands is the daily work of the United Nations.If there are frailties in the united Nations  and there are  If there is some ineptitude  and there is  let us this year celebrate the United Nations endurance and accomplishments while resolving to improve its procedures.In conflicts prevented  in disputes mediated  in the eradication of diseases  in world-wide development progress  in the saving of countless human lives  the United Nations has enriched human existence. It has done all this on a budget that is less than $1 per.year for every inhabitant of the planet. The United Nations should not need to be defended  but it does  and I emphasize that Canada not only defends the united Nations but will work to strengthen it and work to strengthen other parts of the multilateral system. This is the way towards the peace and the growth  the freedom and the justice  which the world needs.The challenges facing the multilateral system reach beyond this institution. Questions are being raised about whether the States of the world will work together or whether nations will draw back to their individual devices. Whether the issue is debt or trade or culture  whether the nations are rich or poor  large or small  there is a renewal of doubt about the international system. Developing countries again this week in this Hall threatened to.abandon an international monetary system which they believe has abandoned them. Trade protectionist pressures are rampant  and dates are delayed for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. Expenditures on arms increase; so does terrorism; so have regional conflicts.If that continues we will all be the victims. Certainly a country like Canada is imperiled if nations cannot agree on the rules of trade or the relief of debt or the control of arms. Twenty-four years ago only 12 per cent of our gross national product was based on exports; today this figure has more than doubled. When the United Nations began Canada was relatively unaffected by violent sectarian disputes in other countries; today we  like the world  are targets of terrorists. Forty years ago drugs c technology or the economic policies of other countries had relatively little direct impact on Canada; today they can intrude directly on the life of every Canadian community. So it is with all communities  in all countries. In so small a modern world  we are exposed  inescapably  to common problems which none of us can solve alone. Instead of retreating inward  the world must reach out - not only to celebrate an anniversary but to cope with the inescapable reality of modern times.Today  I renew the commitment made by successive Canadian Governments to the United Nations ever since its birth in the ashes of the Second World War. Prime Minister Mulroney has already personally reaffirmed to the Secretary-General during the letter's much appreciated official visit to Canada earlier this year  Canada's aspirations with regard to the United Nations. Next month  the Canadian Prime Minister will be meeting here with numerous other world leaders to proclaim yet again the importance of the United Nations.This session of the General Assembly will thus provide us with an opportunity to recall the achievements of the last four decades: the virtually complete elimination of colonialism; the recognition of human rights at the international level; a commitment to general and complete disarmament; a program to strengthen the worId's\financial and commercial systems; a Convention on the Law of the Sea; treaties on a whole range of questions; important progress in the fight against illiteracy; and the promotion of the status of women.We particularly welcome the consensus that emerged from the Nairobi Conference  which marked the end of the Decade for women. The nations of the world came to an agreement on a plan of action for the promotion of women  to be implemented over the next 15 years. Canadians are proud of the role played by our delegation in helping bring about a consensus  and our Government intends to define specific ways of carrying out the Nairobi strategies. It goes without saying that in the implementation of its programs and in its recruitment policies at senior levels the Organization must fully respect the objectives enunciated in the Forward-looking Strategies. At the present time women fill less than 6 per cent of senior professional posts  and it is beyond dispute that the United Nations still has much progress to make in the movement towards equity.This session will be a time to pursue serious reform of the procedures of the United Nations. In the harsh Canadian winter houses that slip into disrepair are eventually abandoned precisely because they offer none of the protection they were designed to provide. The house of the United Nations must not be allowed to slip into disrepair  and we must note that disrepair is showing. Divisive political issues intrude too often into specialized agencies. The agenda of the Assembly and its Committees is overloaded regularly with ritual debates. Some rich countries refuse to pay their dues  while others threaten to reduce their share. The Secretary-General has courageously and repeatedly identified these weaknesses.Changes and reforms are central to the existence of the United Nations. He must restore to this Assembly the authority given to it by the Charter. He must accordingly review our efforts and in a systematic fashion lay out for ourselves realizable goals and objectives.He have sent Canadians to Cyprus  the Golan and other trouble-spots because we want the world system to work. What Canadians have helped secure in crisis we intend to preserve now. Delegations will be aware that Canada  with others  has been working in past months to devise and carry through a pragmatic and feasible set of measures with this purpose in mind  we will continue our co-operative efforts with all interested delegations in this search  which is made doubly urgent by the critical substantive issues before us  to which I now turn.Surveying the landscape of world affairs on this fortieth anniversary  we find that no field is bleaker than that of arms control and disarmament. We must face the fact that not a single substantive agreement has come out of the multilateral arms-control process during the first half of the Second Disarmament Decade - not at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  not at the mutual and balanced force reduction talks in Vienna  not at the Stockholm Conference cm Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe.But I have come here not to lament but rather to offer the encouragement and support of Canada in building the climate of confidence necessary for disarmament agreements. No matter what the frustration  we must never give up in our determination to construct a world security system that depends on fewer arms  not more. If more political will is necessary  then let us assert that political will  particularly as we move into 1986  which has been designated the International Year of Peace.In the complex process of arms control and disarmament  priorities must be set straight.First  Canada believes that deep and verifiable reductions in the existing arsenals of nuclear weapons is the highest priority. Moving to lower levels of arms while preserving the stability of the balance at each successive stage of reduction is the only practical way to make progress. Thus we give our full support to the bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union now taking place in Geneva. The summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev in 55 days time provides an opportunity to chart a new course for the future leading to practical steps to unblock the disarmament impasse.Secondly  for Canada the achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty continues to be a fundamental and abiding objective. Our aim is to stop all nuclear testing.Thirdly  the early conclusion of a chemical weapons treaty is now within reach in the Conference on Disarmament.Fourthly  the prevention of an arms race in outer space is now on the world agenda.Thus we know where we are going in arms-control and disarmament measures. The Final Document of the first special session on disarmament  in 1978  should continue to be our guide. The remarkable consensus achieved by the world community on that occasion must again be renewed as we look towards the third special session on disarmament.The success of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which completed its business last Saturday in Geneva  represents an important step forward. States participating in the Conference reaffirmed  on the basis of a consensus  the viability and the vitality of that Treaty  to which has been endorsed by 130 nations have acceded and which prevents the spread of nuclear weapons while at the same time bringing to the wholeinternational community the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The spirit of international co-operation that characterized the review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty showed that the multilateral process can and does contribute effectively to the strengthening of world security.Canada will continue to play an active role in all multilateral bodies and will contribute further to the building of confidence. In this respect Canada has drawn up a program of action for the second part of the current Disarmament Decade. By means of this program we shall intensify our work in the sphere of the improvement of the verification procedures necessary to ensure compliance with agreements entered into.In order to advance the work on verification of compliance with a complete ban on nuclear tests we shall strengthen our capacity for analysis in seismic research  we shall improve our seismic research facilities in northern Canada and enhance our capacity to distinguish minor earthquakes from underground nuclear tests.Within the framework of this program of action we shall be conducting practical studies on the use of chemical weapons. We shall submit these studies to the United Nations and also make Canadian experts available to the Organization for inquiries into allegations of the use of chemical weapons.Moreover we shall work towards the conclusion of a multilateral agreement prohibiting the possession and use of radiological weapons. I appeal to the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude an effective  verifiable treaty prohibiting radiological weapons. Canada is prepared to sign such a treaty immediately.The Canadian delegation will be reporting to the First Committee on the day-to-day efforts made by Canada to lay a foundation for lasting treaties.The relationship between disarmament and development must also be considered constructively and in greater depth. The current level of military expenditures  now in the region of a trillion dollars  at a time when many parts of the world are experiencing destitution  poverty and famine is unacceptable. The Canadian people  which enjoys a wide representation in an increasingly broad network of non-governmental organizations  is particularly sensitive to this imbalance. It aspires to the establishment of genuine human security  characterized by increasing food stocks and a decline in military arsenals.Another important lesson of our 40 years' experience concerns economic growth. We now know that the well-being of everyone depends on the financial  trade and other linkages among our economies. We understand better the challenges of the global market place. And we appreciate better the critical role that developing countries play in the expansion of the world economy.The partnership between developed and developing countries - a partnership of shared responsibilities and commitments - must be enhanced. Canada is very pleased that consensus agreement was reached yesterday  in the Committee to Review and Appraise the International Development Strategy  on a statement of agreed conclusions. This is a significant step. It reflects the serious effort made by all concerned to express the current economic realities in common language. We believe it augurs well for future co-operation.When we look at the problems of the developing world  no case is more poignant than the suffering of sub-Saharan Africa. The global humanitarian response to the crisis in Africa has succeeded in saving thousands  and perhaps millions  of lives  but the experience of this crisis has also identified longer-term challenges.Relief is not enough. Action for permanent development - in partnership with African nations - is essential. African Governments must resolve to give priority to the agricultural sector and to unleash the productive forces in their own societies. But this effort must be matched by a real and sustained commitment by developed nations and indeed by the entire international community. The African crisis will not end until the valiant efforts to relieve the tragedy of today are buttressed by a sustained commitment to building the Africa of tomorrow.The heavy external debt  which afflicts so many countries  is another crippling burden in the developing world. Some progress has been achieved in dealing with the debt situation  thanks to co-operation among creditor Governments  debtor countries  commercial banks  and international institutions. The strategy of adjustment  financing  and rescheduling has demonstrated an impressive flexibility in helping debtors. But  obviously  more adaptation is needed to meet the special needs of debtor nations.Deliberations in the United Nations help in fostering a better understanding of these economic problems and further the activities of various international institutions dealing with them. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have played a key role in this regard. We should ensure that they can and will continue to do so  taking due account of the particular problems facing individual States. The strains facing the multilateral economic system and facing its leading institutions must be dealt with. Bilateral relations between countries on the one hand  and the multilateral system on the other  ought to be mutually complementary and reinforcing.Similarly  protectionism  which threatens the prosperity of developed and developing countries alike  must be resisted. The industrialized countries must keep their markets open to third-world products if the developing countries are to maintain the export earnings necessary to service their external debt and to improve living standards. All of us will lose if our borders close. All therefore have an important stake in ensuring that the multilateral trading system remains open and health/. That is why Canada has been at the forefront in calling for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations  and why we have been working to liberalize trade and resist protectionism in many other ways'.By joining in the preparations for a new trade round now  the developing countries can be joint architects of a revitalized General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) system. Canada is anxious to work with developing countries to identify areas of common interest which could be pursued in the next round.Economic development is critical  but its benefits will be fully realized and enjoyed only if the Member states of the United Nations co-operate together in a concerted plan to tackle the preeminent social and human rights issues of our day.Illicit trafficking and abuse of narcotics and other drugs is a major social challenge on every continent.I am pleased that the United Nations has set out a plan of action in this vital field. Last year  Canada joined others in co-sponsoring a resolution which set in motion the drafting of a new convention to combat the illicit drug trade. It constitutes a key element in current international efforts to deal with this social problem. The convention must aim at strengthening enforcement measures against illicit drug trafficking.We welcome the Secretary-General's proposal for the convening of a drug conference in 1987 at the ministerial level. We commend the link it makes between initiatives needed to cut down on the supply of illicit drugs and the steps required to reduce demand. We will be working actively with other interested countries to develop a resolution to carry this idea further forward at this session.Forty years ago  the Charter made the rights and freedoms of all persona a matter of legitimate concern to the whole international community. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights itself is nearly four decades old. Yet our work has only just begun. As the Secretary-General notes in his current report:""Massive violations of human rights continue to take place  often of tragic proportions."" We must  therefore  expand the frontiers of United Nations activities in the human rights field. This will entail completing the work on the Convention on the Rights of the Child  ensuring that the new Convention against torture is properly implemented  extending the Commission's program of advisory services  encouraging other countries to offer technical assistance in the human rights field  assisting the Working Group on the Disappeared. Moreover  the United Nations must continue to focus attention on the fate of prisoners of conscience  ensure that the disabled are not deprived of their basic rights  protect the special interests of indigenous populations around the world  and take steps to protect the rights of those who themselves promote human rights.I cannot fail to take note of the wide range of political confrontation and open warfare that so lamentably haunts this planet from Asia  to Central America to the Middle East  we will have ample opportunity to approach these issues as this session of the Assembly goes about its business. In my view  however  and in the view of my Government  South Africa presents a situation which challenges the world community like no other. It is the most striking example today of what can happen to a country when human rights are systematically violated and abused. It is not the only country where discrimination takes place on the basis of race; much less is it the only country to deny the great majority of citizens access to the political process.But South Africa is the only country where racial discrimination is a first principle of State policy. Human rights violations are written into the Constitution  and the majority are denied their political rights because of the color of their skin  we are all cast down by the lives lost and the people injured  by the repressive measures undertaken by the authorities and by the harsh and callous pressure applied to those who campaign against apartheid.The pity and the shame is that this rich country of enormous human and natural potential could contribute so much to the continent of which it is a part. Instead  its unconscionable violation of fundamental human rights does not stop at its borders.But the South Africa monolith has been shaken. Demonstrations  strikes and acts of resistance against the regime are widespread. Economics have proved to be an engine of change. A wave of disinvestment has taken place and the exchange rate on the rand has dropped significantly.The message in all of this is clear: 40 years after the United Nations Charter came into existence and 35 years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was promulgated  change must come to South Africa  apartheid must be dismantled. Measures to make all South Africans equal within their State must be pursued to the end.Nor can we ignore Namibia. Not only does South Africa hold that Territory in gross violation of United Nations wishes and international law and use it as a springboard for attack on its neighbors but it perpetuates its oppressive practices in that emergent land. Such contempt and continued denial of justice cannot be tolerated by the international community. The community of nations must continue to pressure South Africa to change its offensive policies.Canada has acted steadily and deliberately to add to the pressure for change. We hope that the response of South Africa will allow economic and diplomatic relations between our two countries to continue  but that will require real progress against apartheid. We are consulting and co-operating with our friends in the Commonwealth  in the front-line States and elsewhere to find the most effective means to end a system which is repugnant to Canadians.Yet another growing violation of civilized conduct  terrorism  must be dealt with in more detail by the United nations. As we Canadians have learned in the past year  terrorism is a menace to which no nation is immune. At this Assembly we shall actively seek new ways  through new international instruments if necessary  to deal effectively with this scourge. Canada  already a party to all the international air security conventions  will ratify the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages. We were heartened that the Seventh united Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders supported the efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization to promote universal acceptance of and strict compliance with international air security conventions. The international community has shown that it has the political will to act.Finally  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations must be remembered as a time of a united call for the peace that will come from effective disarmament and economic development for all.An organization that embodies the cry to peace of ""We  the peoples of the United Nations"" cannot be irrelevant now or 40 years from now. The gravity of the threat to global survival must be matched by the intensity of our efforts to build the conditions for lasting peace. The peoples of the United Nations have the right to expect to find their hopes fulfilled by the actions of every Government that comes to this rostrum.We know that the challenges are huge; we will not be daunted by them. We know that the problems are infinite; we will not be intimidated by their complexity. We know that international relationships are frayed; we will not be deterred in our efforts for their repair.To put it simply  Canada  along with all other sovereign countries of good faith  will use the United Nations to pursue indomitably the quest for peace  security and social justice."
"24",1259,"CHL",40,1985,"On behalf of the Chilean delegation I wish first of all to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are delighted that such an important post should have been entrusted to a diplomat of your vast experience  a person who has faithfully dedicated so many years to the United Nations and who  from a sentimental standpoint  has been closely linked to my country.It is also fitting to pay a tribute to Ambassador Paul Lusaka  who performed his duties as President of the Assembly at its thirty-ninth session with brilliance  talent and impartiality.We are likewise indebted to the Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts to revitalize the Organization and make its presence more effective in all fields of human endeavor  as well as for his special dedication to the cause of peace. We reiterate before the Assembly our firm support of his conduct of United Nations affairs.Forty years ago the founders of this Organization expressed their unswerving intention to create an integrated international community in which sovereign States could face the present and conceive the future  all united by the essential bond of solidarity.The tragedy of the Second World War  which in a single generation had subjected humanity to untold suffering and death  had been left behind. Our peoples had manifested their weariness and skepticism as a result of the unsuccessful attempt to maintain peace through power politics and balances based on fragile and ephemeral alliances and counter-alliances.An international community organized multilaterally appeared to be a suitable response to the aspirations to peace  progress and. solidarity: the United Nations  through its mechanisms for security and co-operation  and together with the establishment of an international order based on the majesty of the law  would make of these aspirations a reality. Furthermore  in San Francisco the representatives of our Governments established principles outlawing the use of force and promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes. On the economic front  the free flow of products  capital and services was emphasized in order to replace extreme economic nationalism.In its 40 years of existence the Organization has made important contributions and  despite its limitations  we must recognize the fact that it has carried out an essential function. Its universal character assures at all times a channel for communication and dialog. In periods of crisis it has been able to reduce tensions and the peace-making action of its relevant bodies has proved to be relatively effective on various occasions.In fact  the United Nations has demonstrated that  if intentions regarding common and higher objectives can be reconciled  it is capable of broadening the frontiers of the human condition. That is the case with regard to decolonization. Our Organization has been the key factor in the process of peaceful transfer of power from the metropolitan centers to the peoples that have recently gained their sovereignty  thereby achieving the full application of the principle of self-determination for peoples. This development takes on added importance as we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV).As a member of the Committee on decolonization  my country is committed to these processes of national emancipation  which evoke the glory of our own independence that gave us  and the other Republics of the Western hemisphere  our nationality more than a century and a half ago. We shall continue to co-operate actively with the United Nations in support of this noble cause  just as we have done traditionally in the past.Through the United Nations system  international co-operation has acquired a dimension and scope unknown at any previous time. Perhaps this is one of the most notable achievements of international coexistence.The specialized agencies and the subsidiary organs have traditionally been faithful exponents of the ideals that gave rise to their creation. Their effectiveness largely depends on their not diluting their functions towards areas outside of their fields of competence. The interest of certain States in introducing political problems into these bodies is of particular concern to ray Government. We reject these tendencies because we are convinced that the role of international organizations is to eliminate or reduce conflicts and in no way to create  exacerbate or generalize them.The United Nations can be considered as the most celebrated landmark in the history of the struggle to base international relations on the rule of law. The Charter of the Organization is the focal point  since it has laid down the bases for a true international juridical order.In the field of the progressive development and codification of international law  the Charter makes these tasks a political aim  and Member States are committed to cooperation in carrying them out. The work of the United Nations in this regard has been notable and productive.It is of particular interest and satisfaction to my country  which has traditionally based its foreign policy on international law  to support and participate actively in the work of the Organization. We are convinced that there are no reasonable alternatives to the creation of what we could term a genuine and effective legal and international community.Another principle of the Charter incorporated into the core of Chile's foreign policy is full support for the use of peaceful means for settling international disputes. Chile and Argentina have recently given a new demonstration of the validity of this principle and of the unlimited possibilities for reaching an understanding through peaceful means when the law and the will to negotiate are present. In this endeavor in the cause of peace  the mediating efforts of His Holiness Pope John Paul II were a determining factor. His concern made possible the signing of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship that put an end to a complex and delicate situation. Once overcome  a constructive and integrating stage of great historical implication for these two sister nations became possible.Throughout seven long years  Chile and Argentina were involved in a serious  profound and transcendental process of negotiation  aimed at bringing an end to a historic controversy. Government officials  technicians  diplomats and jurists of both countries joined forces and talents to overcome difficulties and seek formulas making possible the aforementioned settlement  a process culminating in ratification of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship.This accord includes four essential elements: solution of the dispute; renunciation of the use of force; a mechanism for compulsory arbitration to solve any controversy that might arise in the future  and an instrument of co-operation aimed at promoting broader integration between the two countries. The negotiation effort was  therefore  undertaken not only to overcome past problems but also to lay the foundations for building the future together.That is why the people of Chile take legitimate pride in the fact that these two South American nations have set an example to the world.This action by Chile and Argentina  designed to consolidate the peace  represents a sound pattern for giving effect to the principles of the Charter  in sharp contrast with the realities of a world full of violence and unsolved conflicts. It is also in sharp contrast with the paralysis which prevents the Security Council from making the contribution to peace which is incumbent upon it. It is similarly in contrast with the impotence with which the international community views the existence of conflicts that become worse and tend to spread.The realization of the objectives confirmed by the Charter must be effected with complete respect for the principles of the sovereign equality of States and non-intervention in their internal affairs. The history of the first 40 years of the Organization demonstrates that  to the extent that it maintains in its acts due harmony between its goals and these two fundamental principles  the work of the United Nations has been effective and productive for all peoples. When the balance is disrupted the mechanisms of the Organization become  at best  innocuous or turn into a mere scenario for the exacerbation of conflicts and rhetorical outbursts.The vocation of universality of the United Nations has not weakened the basic idea that the sovereign State continues to be the basic unit of the international community. For that reason  every time the principle of sovereign equality is violated through discriminatory actions  a blow is delivered to one of the premises which enables the Organization to be effective.Similarly  whenever the United Nations intervenes in the internal affairs of States  the Charter is being violated and the Organization loses its power of persuasion and the moral authority for achieving its objectives. In fact  the principle of non-intervention and its confirmation as a rule of international law have been regarded as a primordial objective of their international policy by the countries of the Latin American region. My country  which gives a special meaning to this principle  believes it is opportune at the present moment to recall the historic ""Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (resolution 2625 (XXV)). Among other provisions  it emphasizes that strict compliance by all States with the obligation not to intervene in the affairs of others is an essential condition for assuring peaceful coexistence among nations.Complete respect for the sovereign attributes of a State constitutes a guarantee  especially for the small or medium-sized nations which  including Chile  represent the great majority of the Members of the Organization. They wish to develop their own political  economic  social and cultural plans with full autonomy and free from threats of foreign interference.Chile  which in recent years has lived through difficult hours while seeking to consolidate the freedom which was almost completely lost in the political process of 1970 to 1973  has often suffered from blatant interference in its internal affairs. Countries which are unaware of the real situation have always been disposed to take a negative view of our actions. We have also been victims of one of the most subtle forms of interference  namely  the campaign of disinformation which was mounted politically on an international scale  aimed at distorting our image in the eyes of world public opinion.While acknowledging the accomplishments of the United Nations system in the maintenance of security  the promotion of co-operation  the codification and progressive development of international law  it is also necessary to refer to the serious problems and obstacles which face our Organization. The fact that we are today attending the fortieth session of the General Assembly makes it even more timely to reflect on the way in which the Organization and its Members have responded to the challenge of history and to the expectations and desires which our predecessors sowed in San Francisco. We observe with consternation that despite the clear and mandatory rules contained in the Charter  the policies of force  aggression and ideological imperialism continue to exist. For its part  the collective security system provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter has not been effective because of the lack of co-operation among the permanent members of the Security Council. That co-operation  a necessary condition for effective action in cases of a breach of the peace  did not succeed in surviving the emergency created by the Second World War. It seems that the international community forgot the lessons of history as soon as the forces of aggression were defeated and before the reconstruction of a devastated world occurred.Disillusionment with the way the United Nations system has operated since then in maintaining international peace and security has induced many to seek security in the old notions of power politics and increases in armaments. They ignore the fact that such a strategy is futile and illusory  since the unilateral search for security only generates feelings of insecurity in others  thus creating incentives for changing the status quo in the vain hope of achieving the much-desired feeling of security.My Government is convinced that the challenge of today requires us to strengthen our common action through renewed support for the purposes and principles of the Charter.In the area of promoting international co-operation we observe that the forms of action accepted as effective and necessary yesterday are today going through a critical period. There is no political will to give a new impetus to co-operation and to deal with the grave problems now confronting us.This session of the Assembly is taking place at a time of acute international economic crisis that is affecting most countries  and above all the developing countries. Those countries see their prospects of progress fading alarmingly  and they are finding themselves exposed to political upheavals and to economic and social conflicts with unpredictable consequences.Recovery appears uncertain and fragile  both in pace and distribution  reaching only a small number of nations without reflecting itself significantly in most of the countries.The outlook is most disturbing. Interest rates remain high  and financial flows to the developing countries are still inadequate. The servicing of foreign debt has become an excessive burden and goes hand in hand with a dramatic deterioration in the terms of trade. More serious  however  is the enormous discrepancy in the process of adjustment in the world economy: while a far-reaching adjustment  with very high social costs  is being imposed on us as developing countries  other countries with a decisive influence on the international economy have been limiting the inevitable transformation of their own economies by increasingly resorting to protectionism.International co-operation and obligations and commitments we have undertaken require that all of us  and particularly the developed countries  must take the external effects of our internal economic policies into account.Chile has made great sacrifices  as have most Latin American countries  in order to adapt its economy to steadily worsening external conditions. The coherent macroeconomic program we have undertaken to correct the situation provides for a properly adjusted balance of payments and a gradually declining rate of inflation. This national development strategy encourages domestic savings and gives priority to stimulating employment. The main motive force remains the promotion of exports as the source of funds. However  this aim will be unattainable if market access for our products is not improved and stabilized.There is an urgent need for a comprehensive analysis of the external debt problem of the developing countries based on the existing relationship between trade and financing in order to align the presumed objectives of the monetary and international trade system with the existing political and economic realities.It has been clearly demonstrated in recent years that none of the debtor countries will be able simultaneously to pay its foreign debts  spur economic growth and maintain the political and social balance in its own society.When the mere payment of interest forces a country to apply for further loans  a historically unique and politically untenable stage has been reached where the debtor developing countries become net exports of capital to the industrialized countries  as has been the case for some years.We recognize that annual negotiations have considerably relieved the problem and that their conditions have improved over the years. However  the enormous burden of a constant adjustment  supported exclusively by the developing countries  in conjunction with an obvious deterioration in the world economic situation  makes it clear that that cannot be regarded as the only way of handling this problem.Responsibility for the debt is shared by the debtor countries  the creditor countries  the international financial institutions and private banks. As already stated  thus far the sacrifice involved in confronting the crisis has fallen exclusively upon the developing countries  together with all the ensuing unemployment  poverty and suffering.There will be no solution to this situation unless all the actors in the drama assume their share of responsibility. This has been the basis for the statements that the countries participating in the Cartagena Consensus have been making. The Consensus calls urgently for a political dialog to solve the problem of the foreign indebtedness of the developing countries  in terms not only in its immediate aspects but also of its rejections for the future of international economic relations.Each day the world becomes less safe. In addition to the constant acts of terrorism that oppress us with their widespread harvest of irrational violence and death  there are international situations of conflict that seem to take on a permanent form  testifying to the lack of willingness to seek peaceful solutions that will ensure the rule of law.We are concerned and distressed by the endless dismembering of Lebanon  a nation to which we are joined by ties of friendship  and a country that was once an outstanding example of prosperity in the region. We await with concern and impatience the restoration of the forms traditional coexistence in that country  based on the essential conditions of respect for its territorial integrity  sovereignty and political independence.The bonds of friendship that link us to the nations of the Middle East go back a long way. Many sons of those lands have settled in our country. Consequently we look forward with particular anxiety and concern to the achievement of a just and peaceful solution to the problem posed by this long-standing center of international tension. We trust there will be increasing acceptance of the possibility of peaceful coexistence and collaboration among the States of the region.Chile continues to maintain that it is essential to ensure  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  the right of all the States of the region  including Israel  to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries  and that that country withdraw from all the occupied territories. It is also essential to ensure the exercise of the right of the Palestine people to self-determination  including the right to found their own State.My Government wishes again to join ranks with the great majority of States that categorically condemn and reject the Soviet invasions of Afghanistan and of Kampuchea  the latter in association with its vassal regime in Viet Nam. We indignantly denounce the veritable genocide being committed daily against the patriots of those oppressed countries who are fighting for their inalienable right to self-determination. The intransigence of the Soviet Union  which does not hesitate to use military force if that suits its imperial interests  constitutes an act of direct defiance of the international community and is an affront to our Organization  which has demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the aggressors.By acting as a sponsor of the draft resolutions this Assembly will beconsidering on these situations  ray country joins the international community's condemnation of the brutal repression of the fundamental rights of those peoples. Chile energetically opposes the idea that such acts should be accepted asirreversible  since they are backed by the illegitimate use of force. Aggression confers no rights.With regard to the situation in Korea  we support the inter-Korean negotiations as the only realistic  peaceful formula  free from outside interference  for harmoniously resolving a situation which has been dragging on for so many years. My country  in keeping with its traditional defense of the principle of universality of this Organization  takes the view that the presence of both Koreas in the United Nations would contribute to a rapprochement of the parties and a negotiated solution of the dispute.As an active member of the decolonization Committee and of the United Nations Council for Namibia since they were first set up  Chile shares the growing international concern over South Africa's unwillingness to grant the Namibian people their right to independence by peaceful means and in conformity with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).We note with concern that the continuation of the practice of apartheid  repeatedly condemned by the entire international community  could lead the region of southern Africa to a serious confrontation  creating a new focal point of international tension. There is still time for a peaceful and negotiated way out of this critical situation which otherwise could become unmanageable.Because they involve sister nations with which Chile is proud to have enjoyed a long-standing relationship  we are deeply disturbed by the slow pace of the negotiations for establishing peace in Central America.We maintain our support for the Contadora Group's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis  in order to give full effect to the relevant principles of international law  as well as to the values of freedom and human dignity desired by the republics of our continent.We are most distressed to note once again the absence of progress in disarmament and the consequent increase in the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race. The serious difficulties facing the multilateral negotiations and the dialog between the two great Powers are obvious  as well as the lack of effectiveness of the legal instruments we possess to discourage this growing threat to our peoples.The nuclear danger  undoubtedly the most serious threat  and the increase in military expenditure  which seems to extend throughout the world  present us with a gloomy picture  contrasting dramatically as they do with the poverty  hunger and despair afflicting millions of human beings.Chile  in keeping with its traditional position  is prepared to support international efforts aimed at the achievement of general and complete disarmament  under effective international control and verification.My country has throughout its history urged and supported regional initiatives leading to arms control and the reduction of military budgets. In 1902 we signed an agreement with the Argentine Republic whereby both countries committed themselves to limiting their armaments and seeking a balance between their respective navies.Later  in 1959  the President of Chile  Mr. Jorge Alessandri  proposed a limitation on arms in Latin America  as the General Assembly was duly informed  designed to release funds to be used for the economic and social development of the region. The Organization of American States (OAS) took note of the Chilean concern and proposed the holding of a specialized conference on the subject. Unfortunately  this did not take place. In 1977  we proposed to the Andean countries that they reduce their military budgets  and two meetings were held to consider the proposal.A few weeks ago the President of Chile  Mr. Augusto Pinochet  gave a clear demonstration of the peace-loving spirit of my country  when he responded to the call of the President of Peru  Mr. Alan Garcia  calling on the South American nations to abstain from acquiring more weapons. In his reply  the Chilean Head of State indicated his willingness to support the proposal on the basis of regional reciprocity and to have those resources allocated to the material development of our continent.We trust that this noble proposal will materialize for we are committed to collaborating firmly on this initiative.One of the most important instruments  and certainly the most successful in this field of disarmament  has been the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959. The system  created by this international instrument  has established a regime of peace and demilitarization on an entire continent. Military deployment and the introduction of armaments  conventional or nuclear  are prohibited. For the first and only time in the history of disarmament agreements  an effective on-site inspection system was instituted and the dumping of nuclear waste was forbidden.The benefits of the Antarctic Treaty are not limited  however  to the sphere of disarmament. In reality  it deals with an integral system of broad international co-operation for exclusively peaceful purposes  open to the participation of any interested State. It stands as an example for all nations.Chile  a country which enjoys and exercises sovereign rights in the Antarctic and linked to it by unquestionable historical and juridical bonds  as well as geographic continuity and a long-standing presence  fully supports the operation of the Antarctic Treaty  which adequately guarantees the interests of all countries  and upholds the maintenance of consensus within our Organization for dealing with the subject.The international community notes with growing concern an increase in terrorist actions in various parts of the world. It notes with anxiety that in many instances these crimes against mankind remain unpunished because of the protection those responsible find in some States.The urgent task today is to make a serious effort to discourage this criminal activity which affects innocent human lives and can jeopardize the normal development of relations of friendship and co-operation among peoples.My country supports efforts to find a global solution for this social evil through the drafting of clear legal rules banning terrorist acts anywhere they occur and curbing those who are involved in any way. We must commit ourselves as States to providing international guarantees for the safety of individuals and their possessions.Based on a wide and general political consensus  terrorism must be repudiated in all its forms  regardless of its motives. Such behavior must be treated as a crime against mankind so that justice will not be obstructed for any reason.Chile's foreign policy gives high priority to our ties with the Pacific Basin and seeks too develop broad and reciprocally beneficial means to co-operate with the coastal and insular States of the Basin. We hope that as a result of these efforts we can create new forms of integration which will encourage greater interchange of all kinds.We also share with these nations a deep concern with regard to the continued French nuclear explosions taking place at the Muroroa Atoll. The Permanent Commission of the South Pacific  to which we belong together with Peru  Ecuador and Colombia  has repeatedly expressed its condemnation of and protest against these nuclear tests which pose a grave danger to people  to the environment and to natural resources.With regard to the present state of the exploration of outer space and related research  Chile encourages the development of space law  scientific co-operation and the basic idea that all activity in that sphere must always be carried out for peaceful purposes of benefit to mankind. In this regard we reiterate our initiative to create regional mechanisms in Latin America.Chile has a long history of active participation in the formulation of the contemporary law of the sea  and its contribution to this subject has been relevant and forward-looking.In this context I believe it is necessary to call special attention to the recent decision of the Chilean Government  which  supported by the norms of the new law of the sea  recently proclaimed national sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea-bed around the islands of Pascua  Sala and Gomez in the Central Pacific Ocean for a distance of 350 miles.In my capacity as Special Envoy to the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  I have the honor to transmit the following special message from the President of Chile  His Excellency Augusto Pinochet Ugarte: ""On this historic occasion  Chile wishes to reiterate the commitment made in 1945 as a signatory country to the Charter of San Francisco  reaffirm its confidence in the principles and objectives of the Organization  and ratify its willingness to collaborate with States prepared to make a reality of the theme 'The United Nations for a better world'.""During the past four decades the Organization has left its mark on the action taken by its peoples to realize the objectives of peace  security  freedom  justice and development that inspired the founders of the Organization.""However despite the efforts made and the successes registered  there is still much to be done to make the principles of the Charter a reality.""We live in a world distressed by violence and terrorism  which  encouraged and directed by very well defined interests and ideological centers of power  cause death  suffering and chaos in the most varied latitudes.""Fairness is absent from international economic relations  and the developing countries do not encounter the understanding necessary for the mobilizing of their resources and the benefiting of their peoples through the efforts they have made.""The Chilean Government has observed with concern the persistent violations of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. This principle  the basis of international coexistence  is ignored not only in the unilateral actions of some States  but also  and this is even more serious  in the headquarters of some international organizations.""In an Organization of sovereign States  in which decisions are applied through conviction rather than coercion  the political willingness of States to apply the mechanisms of the Charter and make its principles operational is essential.""We have noted a crisis in the collective political will. The goal of understanding is absent. Conflict predominates over consensus  and unilateral decisions prevail to the detriment of co-operation.""The Chilean Government expresses its fervent desire that this anniversary represent the beginning of a new era in the life of the Organization in which the international community will witness realization of its desires for peace  prosperity and development  the values that constitute the basis of the San Francisco Charter.""Chile's foreign policy has always been inspired by the principles of the Charter  and my Government  on this solemn occasion  reiterates its permanent commitment to them and to their strengthening."""
"25",1305,"CHN",40,1985,"At the outset I should like warmly to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly and to wish you every success  in your highly responsible post.I wish also to take this opportunity to express my thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Lusaka  for his contribution to the work of the last session  for which he has won the respect of all of us.Being convened during celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  the present session is more significant than the previous ones. The United Nations is the outcome of victory in the world war against fascism. The United Nations Charter laid down the purposes and principles for maintaining world peace  suppressing acts of aggression  ensuring international security  promoting international co-operation  respecting the equality of nations  large and small  settling international disputes by peaceful means and refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of any State. Facts show that these purposes and principles established 40 years ago are still of great immediate significance four the just handling of the problems facing the world today. The purpose of solemnly commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is to reaffirm the unalterable principles of the United Nations Charter and further strengthen the functions of the United Nations so that it may play a greater role in the noble cause of maintaining world peace and increasing international co-operation.In the past 40 years tremendous changes have taken place in the international situation and the world as a whole. The vigorous movement for national independence has made colonialism a thing of the past as a system. A number of countries have taken the road of socialist development. The emergence of the third world and the numerous small and medium-sized countries on the world political arena has brought a fundamental change to the pattern of international relations. With the rapid development of modern science and technology  mankind has achieved successes beyond the imagination of the past generations in the effort to conquer nature  expand productive forces and enhance its own welfare and has broadened the vistas of a better future before it.The changes of the post-War world are reflected in the changing United Nations. The emergence of many newly-independent countries in Asia  Africa  Latin America  and Oceania and the consequent big increase in the membership of the United Nations have strengthened the universality of the Organization. Despite the twists and turns the United Nations has gone through  we should on the whole give a positive appraisal of its efforts for peace  international co-operation and the greater well-being of mankind. We congratulate the United Nations on its achievements over the past 40 years and are ready to work with all other Member States to strengthen the role of the Organization.Compared with the preceding year there are certain signs of relaxation in the world situation. But the root cause of tension remains. There is a universal desire for a genuine relaxation of international tension. To this end it is imperative to stop the arms race and seek fair and reasonable solutions to regional conflicts. Here  I should like to speak on those two issues.In the past four decades of discussions on disarmament have been going on every year  both inside and outside 'he United Nations. Regrettably  the arms race has never ceased for a single moment. On the contrary  it has kept escalating. That is an undeniable historical fact. One may ask several questions: How many nuclear weapons were there in the world in 1963 when the partial nuclear-test-ban Treaty was signed? How many nuclear weapons were there in 1972 when the interim United States-Soviet agreement on strategic arms limitation was signed? And how many more nuclear weapons are there today as compared with 20 years ago? The number of strategic nuclear warheads alone has increased several times. This trend cannot but cause general concern. The arms race cannot possibly be a unilateral affair. Although both sides have claimed only to maintain parity  each is in fact bent on gaining supremacy over the other. When one side declares that it has fallen behind and must catch up  the other side will do likewise on the same excuse. This inevitably leads to an alternating escalation of their arms race. In order to change the long-standing situation in the arms race  in which each side tries to outdo the other  it is imperative for the two nuclear Powers that possess 95 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons earnestly to consider taking the lead in drastically reducing their nuclear arsenals. They will still have enough left to destroy each other even if their nuclear arsenals are cut by half  let alone by a quarter. It must be pointed out that the arms race between the super-Powers has been extended from land  sea and air to outer space. If this trend of large-scale qualitative escalation is allowed to continue unchecked  it is bound to increase the danger of war and to pose a grave threat to world peace.We welcome the resumption of disarmament talks in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two countries will also hold a summit meeting in the near future. It is hoped that through serious talks they will reach a practical and effective agreement without prejudice to third countries. Of course  it would be unrealistic to pin our hopes for peace on their talks only.In view of the grave threat to world peace posed by the continued escalation of the arms race and in view of the strong desire of the people of the world for nuclear and conventional disarmament  the Chinese delegation wishes to put forward to the General Assembly the following four-point proposal:First  in order to reduce the danger of a nuclear war and to create the conditions for the complete elimination of that danger  all nuclear States - and the two big nuclear Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  in particular -should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons in any circumstances and should unconditionally pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states or against nuclear-free zones. Proceeding on such a basis  an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons should be concluded with the participation of all nuclear States.Secondly  in order to avert the possible escalation of a conventional war into a nuclear war in areas with a high concentration of nuclear and conventional weapons; the two military blocs - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty organization - should reach an agreement as early as possible on the drastic reduction of their conventional weapons.Thirdly  outer space belongs to all mankind and ought to be used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of all. The United States and the Soviet Union should immediately stop the arms race in all its forms in outer space. All countries with a space capability should refrain from developing  testing or deploying outer space weaponry. An international agreement on the complete prohibition and destruction of outer space weaponry should be concluded as soon as possible.Fourthly  in view of the fact that the arms race in the development of chemical weapons has not been checked  the 40-nation Geneva Conference on Disarmament is called upon to complete its negotiations at an early date and to conclude a convention on the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of chemical weapons. Pending that  all countries capable of manufacturing and producing chemical weapons should stop testing  producing  transferring and deploying chemical weapons and should pledge not to use such weapons.The aforesaid points are all reasonable measures for resolving the most pressing issues of our time. We hope that the above proposal will be considered by the General Assembly in the interest of promoting disarmament and a relaxation of international tension.China's position on disarmament is clear and firm. We are resolutely opposed to the arms race and stand for practical and effective measures to reduce armaments. China's military expenditure has long been kept at a low level. Although there has been a fairly rapid growth in China's economy in recent years  its military expenditure has not increased correspondingly.The few nuclear weapons China possesses and the United number of nuclear tests it has conducted are solely for the purpose of self-defense. On the very first day we came into possession of a nuclear force  we declared that China would never be the first to use nuclear weapons. China has also undertaken not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States or nuclear-free zones.Not long ago  China decided to reduce the size of its military force by 1 million. Part of China's military industry is being shifted to civilian production so as to meet the increasing daily needs of our people.We have demonstrated our desire for peace and our policy of peace with actual deeds.The existence of hot spots is an important source of world tension and turbulence. Where there are hot spots  there is a danger of expanded conflicts and crises and they deprive large parts of the world of tranquility. How to end conflicts and remove hot spots is a concern of us all. We are in favor of political settlement  but political settlement can only be achieved through peaceful negotiations on a fair and reasonable basis. In other words  there must be full respect for the sovereignty and independence of countries and strict observance of the international principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any other country. Professed readiness for a political settlement with the intent to impose on others a fait accompli created by aggression  expansion and interference is nothing but a fraud. The Chinese Government has always maintained that international disputes should be settled through peaceful negotiations on an equal footing  in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence  without resort to the use or threat of force.The Kampuchean question remains a matter of concern to the international community. While expanding the war in Kampuchea and incessantly violating the borders of Thailand and China  Viet Nam has resorted to political tricks by using ""political settlement"" as a means to split and destroy the Kampuchean patriotic forces one by one. But this attempt cannot possible succeed. The tripartite Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  headed by Prince Sihanouk  has closed its ranks and persevered in the struggle against the aggressors  winning extensive support from the international community.China is firmly opposed to Viet Nam's occupation of Kampuchea and any big Power's support for such acts of aggression. In our view  the key to the solution of the Kampuchean issue is the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from that country. The so-called complete withdrawal of troops from Kampuchea by 1990 is a sheer hoax  the aim of which is to eliminate the resistance forces and perpetuate Viet Nam's control over Kampuchea. China sincerely hopes that Kampuchea will become an independent  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned country. We appreciate the position taken by the countries of the Association of South-Bast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in support of the Kampuchean people's struggle against Vietnamese aggression  for national salvation and in the search for a just solution to the Kampuchean question. The proposal for a Kampuchean solution put forward by the recent ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting is reasonable  as are the position and steps taken by Democratic Kampuchea in regard to the present situation. Viet Nam should make a positive response to all this if it really wants a solution.The Afghan issue is in essence one of armed aggression against  intervention in and occupation of a non-aligned country by large numbers of troops dispatched by a super-Power  which have not only grossly trampled on the norms guiding international relations but also posed a grave threat to the peace and security of neighboring regions. We condemn the intensifying military suppression of the Afghan people and demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. We support the efforts made by the parties concerned to bring about a just solution to the Afghan question in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.We resolutely support the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab -peoples and strongly demand Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967. We maintain that all countries in the Middle East are entitled to exercise the right to independence and existence. We support the Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization in their efforts to strengthen their unity and to attain their national goals through political negotiation and by other means. We are in favor of holding an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations so as to seek a just and comprehensive solution to the Middle Bast question and bring about peace in the region.We are opposed to any outside intervention in the affairs of the Central American countries. The internal problems of Central American countries should be solved by the people of the respective countries. We support the Contadora Group in its continued efforts to arrive at a peaceful settlement of Central American problems and hope that the parties concerned will take practical steps and hold consultations on an equal footing so as to ease the tension in the region.Recently  the situation in southern Africa has deteriorated drastically. In defiance of opposition from the international public  the South African authorities have clung stubbornly to the system of apartheid and racial discrimination  openly declaring a state of emergency in some towns and cities  in ruthless suppression of the black people.They have set up an interim government in Namibia to obstruct its independence and intensified their acts of aggression and provocation against neighboring countries. That racism and apartheid should exist now  in the 1980s  is a disgrace to mankind. We indignantly condemn the South African authorities for their crimes perpetuating racist rule  bloody suppressing the black people in South Africa and willfully invading and threatening neighboring States.We sternly demand that the South African authorities immediately abolish the so-called interim government they have rigged up in Namibia and terminate their illegal occupation of the country so that it may attain independence at the earliest possible date  in compliance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We will  as always  unswervingly support the South African people in their struggle against racism  the Namibian people in their struggle for national independence and the other peoples of southern Africa in their struggle for national security  peace and stability.We support the proposal put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea - namely  the establishment of a confederate republic with two coexistent systems and the holding of parliamentary talks between the North and the South  as well as tripartite talks. United States troops should be withdrawn from South Korea. We support dialog between the north and the south and appreciate all efforts conducive to the relaxation of tension on the Korean peninsula.While discussing the danger of war in the current international situation  we must not lose sight of the growth and development of forces for peace.For the sake of survival and development  the third-world countries  whose aggregate population accounts for three quarters of the world's total  resolutely oppose war and the arms race  and demand world peace.Many member States of the East and West military blocs  having suffered the catastrophe of two world wars  are unwilling to be dragged into another war.The many small and medium-sized countries in Asia  Oceania and Europe do not want war. They demand independent and equal participation in international affairs and oppose big-Power domination of the world.Hundreds of millions of people in the world  including intellectuals  artists  scientists and religious leaders of different races and creeds  all hate war and desire peace. Engaging in different forms of activity against the arms race and the threat of a nuclear war. they constitute a mighty and irresistible force for peace.In a word  the people are the motive force of history and the masters of the world. They will take their destiny into their own hands. Popular desire for peace is the general trend of the world. Whoever undermines peace by resorting to an arms race and the threat of war will be opposed by the overwhelming majority of the people. Drawing a bitter lesson from the Second World War  they are determined to take preventive measures against the possible danger and avoid the recurrence of the historical disaster. Both the nuclear super-Powers have overkill capabilities and neither of them can afford to ignore the calamitous consequences of a nuclear war for itself  therefore  so long as the people of all countries continue their efforts  persevere in struggle and develop the peace forces against war  there are good hopes for the maintenance of world peace.Development is a major issue closely related to world peace. World economic development has been characterized by growing imbalance and instability in recent years as a result of the widening economic gap between the developed and the developing countries. At present  many countries still face grave economic difficulties. Latin America groans under a crushing debt burden. Africa is not only plagued with drought and famine but also beset by the debt problem. And Asia is suffering greatly from trade protectionism. Moreover  they are generally faced with lack of development funds  a fall in the prices of raw materials and primary products and sharp fluctuation in the money and financial markets. All this greatly hinders the growth of the developing countries.Since achieving political independence  the developing countries have scored marked successes and accumulated valuable experience in their strenuous endeavor to develop the national economy. Facts have shown that the important point for the third-world countries is how to formulate a development strategy suited to their actual conditions so as to alleviate the current economic difficulties and ensure a steady economic growth. As an old Chinese saying has it  ""Poverty gives rise to a desire for change and change will work out a way leading to success and success tends to hold out."" The developing countries should be able to lift themselves out of their backwardness. They have rich natural resources and industrious people who desire development. Provided they bring into play all positive factors  tap their own potentials and take part actively in South-South co-operation  they can gradually overcome their difficulties in the course of development.Of course  the development of the third world is not a matter of concern to the third world alone. The international community should take effective measures to create an international economic climate favorable to the economic development of the third world. In a highly interrelated world  the economic stability and growth of the developed countries cannot be based on the stagnation and poverty of the developing countries. The existing international economic order is evidently out of step with the changed world economic and political pattern. To change it into a fair and just economic order benefiting the people of all countries is the call of our time. Besides  the economic stability and development of the South are an important factor making for world peace and stability. The developed countries should be farsighted enough to proceed from the overall interests of the world and give serious attention to the question of the North-South relations. At present  it is imperative in particular to take effective measures in favor of the developing countries by alleviating their debt burden  lowering interest rates  opening markets and providing them with funds and increased economic and technological assistance.In the international economic field  trade  money  finance and debt are interrelated. It is necessary for the international community to seek a composite solution to these pressing issues facing the world economy. The United Nations and other international organizations should step up their role of co-ordination in improving North-South relations. China supports North-South dialog and South-South co-operation in the hope that the joint efforts of North and South will lead to a stable and balanced development of the world economy.Here we wish to mention in particular the critical state of the African economy. The 21st Summit Meeting of the Organization of African Unity  held not long ago  gave expression to the eager desire of the African countries for closer unity and co-operation and the revitaligation of the African economy. We call on the international community and especially the developed countries to do their part in helping the African countries overcome their economic difficulties and improve their economic position.China is both a socialist country and the largest developing country in the world. We have achieved great successes in all fields since the founding of the People's Republic of China 36 years ago. However  prolonged efforts are required before we can thoroughly eliminate backwardness in China and turn our large country of 1 billion people into a modern socialist country with Chinese characteristics. We are carrying out an economic reform to invigorate the domestic economy and open the country to the outside world. This is a great experiment. Experience in our reform over the past few years gives us full confidence in its success. To attain our goal we need peace not only for the rest of this century but in the next century as well.In international affairs  we pursue an independent foreign policy of peace namely we oppose hegemonism and maintain world peace; strengthen China's solidarity and co-operation with the rest of the third world and support the other third-world countries in their just struggles to safeguard their sovereignty and independence and develop their national economies; develop normal relations with all other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence irrespective of the differences or similarities in their social systems as compared with that of China; do not enter into alliance or strategic relationship with any big Power or line up with one against another; make our own independent judgment on international issues; and support whatever is in the interest of world peace  international co-operation and common development and oppose whatever is not.Proceeding from the fundamental interests of the Chinese people  China's independent foreign policy of peace is also in the fundamental interests of the people of the whole world. Fully aware of our responsibility and weight in international affairs  we are determined to do all we can to help relax tension  maintain world peace and promote international co-operation. China will never do anything detrimental to world peace. We will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries  nor seek spheres of influence or practice hegemonism. This is  and will remain  our position. China is a factor making for peace and stability. It is our hope that  with the growth of its economy and strength  China will be able to contribute more to the cause of peace and human progress.Peace  co-operation and development are our goals. They are also our earnest aspirations  which we wish to reaffirm to the whole world on the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. The Chinese Government and people are determined to make sustained and joint efforts together with the peoples of other countries for the realization of these lofty aspirations."
"26",1385,"CMR",40,1985,"The Cameroon delegation fully shares  Sir  in the congratulations and feeling of satisfaction expressed on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. Your nation was in the vanguard of the historic exploration of the ocean spaces that opened new avenues of communication between peoples and nations. It is thus appropriate that a son of the Spanish nation should preside over a commemorative session of the General Assembly at which we must further explore new channels of communication among States and peoples in the process of addressing the grave issues of the time. We have no doubt that your diplomatic skills and the wisdom you have already displayed will enable our deliberations to be both productive and successful.It is with pride that we recall the successful term of office of our brother and your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia. We congratulate him and thank him for a job well done.I wish to pay a glowing tribute to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continued dedication  especially to the cause of the young nations of the African region in their struggle for freedom from various deprivations.We should like also to associate our delegation with the condolences and expressions of solidarity already conveyed to the Government and people of Mexico in connection with the extensive disaster that recently befell that great nation. The reaction of Members of this Organization in embarking on an international relief effort is indicative of the scope of our collective potential as a body when there is the political will.Other disasters  resulting from storms  have occurred in recent weeks along the Atlantic coast of the North American continent. Our condolences go to the Governments and peoples that were the victims. It is our hope that research will be undertaken on a global scale to find preventive and remedial solutions to these predictable invasions from the Garth's atmosphere.We have come to this commemorative session inspired by the mood of the time for change  determined to join with other delegations in undertaking a sober review of 40 years of experience by this universal Organization. It is our hope that this historic session will live up to the expectations of an anxious world in which men  women and children endure unending suffering in conditions of war  strife  hunger  disease and depressing deprivation.The cry of peoples everywhere is for resolutions that are productive of change towards a new and better world. We must consciously create such conditions in international relations as demonstrate a firm determination on the part of States to ensure equal rights and the self-determination of peoples* to avoid intervention in the internal affairs of States; to co-operate with one another systematically to ease or eradicate the malaise of those condemned to face economic and social underdevelopment; to strengthen the capacity of all nations  great and small  to grow and foster the well-being of their populations; to ensure the orderly development of the natural resources that give sustenance to man and his well-being on this planet; and to provide an appropriate response to all threats  both natural and man-made  to human survival.We are convinced that all this is attainable if we all inject the political will into our labors here. We enjoy the common fellowship of collective aspirations enshrined in the one Charter to which we all  the peoples of the united Nations  subscribe.Permit me now to state my nation's views on specific issues that we consider must be addressed by this commemorative fortieth session of the General Assembly.Forty years after the establishment of our Organization it must be admitted that  on balance  an assessment of the Organization's activities is not very heartening; indeed  even though some attribute the fact that there is still no generalized conflagration to United Nations action  it is none the less true that that is not the unanimous view. However  the fact that the Organization has withstood the test of time is in itself a positive element. The difficulties of all kinds which the Organization has experienced are related as much to its world dimension and universal mission as to an inevitable series of growing pains.If the United Nations  reflecting the composition of the world at that time  at the beginning had less than one third of its present membership  it can congratulate itself on the fact that today it includes nearly 160 nations  which are called upon to co-operate on political  economic  social and cultural levels. But  rather than its growth and diversity  it is the lack of the political will of States that has prevented it from functioning with all the effectiveness which nations rightly expect of it  particularly in the areas of collective security and economic co-operation.While it is true that four decades do not represent a significant period in the life of an organization such as ours  it is no less true that for theindividual  who is at the center of United Nations concerns  40 years is an important period which justifies consideration of the ground covered in the light of the problems which challenge mankind as a whole. This is particularly true when one considers the least developed peoples and countries.I am thinking of the countries of the third world in which are concentrated the areas of tension and where the average life expectancy barely exceeds the present age of our Organization. I am thinking  too  of the enslaved peoples and the victims of apartheid  racism  aggression and all forms of discrimination. Lastly  I am thinking of the peoples who  living on the fringes of technological progress  know only disease  hunger and poverty. I believe that it is more urgent than ever before to put the work of our Organization back within the context of the original aims and objectives of the founding fathers.Cameroon greatly appreciates the positive contribution which the Organization has made in several important areas.As regards political matters  decolonization is one of the sectors in which the Organization has done remarkable work. In the space of a generation the United Nations has actively helped to ensure the independence of more than two thirds of its Members.At a time when Cameroon is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its accession to independence and admission to the United Nations  we reiterate our willingness to contribute to the process of decolonization  which must be completed.The case of southern Africa has always been a subject of deep concern to my Government. First of all  with regard to Namibia  we must express our great indignation at the inability of the international community fully to shoulder its responsibilities in connection with that international Territory  which is under the direct authority of the United Nations  despite the consensus achieved almost a decade ago on Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This situation is explained by the customary bad faith of the racist Pretoria regime and its countless delaying tactics. It is also explained by the existence of powerful accomplices with a wide variety of interests that strengthen South Africa's positions and exacerbated  it must be admitted  by a certain resignation on the part of our Organization  of which the inability of the Security Council to ensure the implementation of its resolution 435 (1978) is the most striking manifestation.As we have often said - most recently before this body last June - the consequences of the permanent challenge to the Organization and the international community by South Africa are extremely harmful. These include the erosion of the credibility and the prestige of the United Nations and the danger of the generation and extension of local conflicts  entailing a serious threat to international peace and security  and even to the very survival of mankind in view of the South African racists' nuclear capability.Apartheid  a system of dehumanization  has also become a system of terror  torture and aggression. The declaration of a state of emergency was one more opportunity to treat the black peoples with brutality and even to massacre them with revolting cruelty and cynicism. This aggressive behavior has also been seen in the attacks against neighboring countries  the military invasion of the People's Republic of Angola  the support for armed bands hostile to the legal authorities - all with a view to destabilizing these regimes  which refuse to be satellites.The world can no longer tolerate the ill-considered actions of the fascist Pretoria clique. It is encouraging to see the trend towards increasing awarenessof all this  which has acquired a new dynamism both in southern Africa and among the traditional allies and friends of the apartheid country. There must be no further delay. Only firm action can lead to the completion of the decolonization process in southern Africa with the least possible delay and bring about the democratization of the social and political institutions in that region.Cameroon  for its part  reiterates its support for the Secretary-General in his efforts to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  with the independence plan for Namibia. Cameroon categorically rejects the so-called interim government installed at Windhoek by South Africa on 17 June 1985  as well as any idea of linkage between the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and the independence of Namibia. As a member of the Liberation Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  Cameroon also reiterates its support for the liberation movements of Azania  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the United Nations Council for Namibia  of which it is a member and which is the only legal Administering Authority of Namibia until independence.It is more necessary now than ever before to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter to compel South Africa to co-operate in finding a definitive solution to the problems of southern Africa and Namibia. This is the primary responsibility of the members of the Security Council  particularly those that so far have tended to misuse the special powers entrusted to them under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security  to enable that collective body to make progress without further delay along this path.As for the other African problems of great concern at present  we wish in particular to draw attention here to the question of the Western Sahara and the situation in Chad  a neighbor of Cameroon.With regard to the Western Sahara  it would be useful for the United Nations to pool their efforts with the very commendable efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in order to proceed to the implementation of the relevantresolutions on this question  in particular with regard to holding a referendum on self-determination in the territory.With regard to the situation in Chad  which we are following carefully  we stress once again the need for all in that country to rise above all the differences which separate them in order definitively to seal the unity  independence  sovereignty and progress of Chad in a common destiny.Peace is whole and indivisible. Another turbulent area that has retained the attention of the international community for several decades is the Middle East. Indeed  this region has become a veritable powder keg  while at the same timebecoming an arena for all kinds of rivalry.This situation has been examined on many occasions within this Organization and the facts are well known. Withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories  the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights and the possibility for all the countries and peoples of the region to live in peace and security within secure and recognized boundaries constitute  in our opinion  the elements of a just and lasting solution. But one cannot silence another truth  namely  that the solution of the problems in the Middle Bast  which are already complicated by foreign influence and interference  also depends on clarification of often ambiguous positions of the various Arab countries on this delicate question which threatens international peace and security.With regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict  or the Lebanese problem  the situations of conflict in this region  as elsewhere in the world  whether in South-East Asia or Central America  can be solved satisfactorily only by abiding  in the search for their solutions  strictly by the cardinal principles of the Charter  which include  inter alia  the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for territorial integrity and national sovereignty  and the right of each people freely to choose its own future.On many occasions we have been obliged to stress the central role and primary responsibility of the United Nations in connection with the maintenance of international peace and security  and in particular disarmament. In fact  the attainment of the objectives of peace  security  disarmament and development will remain elusive if  as can be seen from the international climate  the attitude of States  and in particular the most powerful States  is still characterized by confrontation  coercion  suspicion and the obsession to accumulate weapons of mass destruction. One could even expect the worst if  in connection with security  the interests of one State or group of states are given special treatment to the detriment of the more general interests of the entire international community.In other words  focusing the Organization's attention and strengthening its role in the area of disarmament is urgent  even vital. Unfortunately  the partial disarmament agreements or arms control agreements concluded thus far have remained far below their objectives with regard to the reduction of nuclear arsenals  both quantitatively and qualitatively. By the same token  the limitations resulting from negotiations on anti-ballistic missile treaties  and even SALT I and SALT II  have not yet provided mankind with greater stability. The least one can say about all these agreements  the goal of which was to stimulate disarmament  is that they have fallen short of the results hoped for. Hence one can understand not only the persistence of the conventional and nuclear-arms race but in particular the strengthening of the ability of States to manufacture and stockpile weapons of mass destruction which continue to represent the greatest danger facing mankind.This race  which is being pursued dangerously to the detriment of the socio-economic development and security of the majority of States  particularly the small- and medium-sized Powers  is being extended more and more to outer space.At present discussions in the Conference on Disarmament have not produced any appreciable results that might strengthen prospects for a world of stability and security. In particular  I should like to refer to the lack of significant progress on such important subjects as the treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear tests  the international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and the prevention of the arms race in outer space. Instead  there is a dizzying spiral of military expenditures which have reached the figure of $1 000 billion a year and the emergence of new strategic military doctrines that are so dangerous as to reach the point of accepting the absurd concept of localized nuclear war. Similarly  the 1985 session of the Disarmament Commission ended without any tangible conclusions.For its part  Cameroon submitted to that body this year a series of concrete proposals aimed at promoting disarmament. Cameroon emphasized  inter alia  the need for the United Nations to have a sound  rational political process for ongoing deliberations and negotiations which would make it possible to identify measures to promote peace  security  disarmament and development. Such a process requires the universalization of efforts within the United Nations  with a view to nuclear disarmament  first of all. In other areas  and in particular in connection with conventional weapons  my country is also proposing a variety of approaches at the bilateral  subregional and regional levels.This requires  with regard to the Secretariat of the United Nations  rationalized structures and programs and activities to strengthen its effectiveness and co-ordination  while eliminating waste and duplication  thus facilitating discussions and negotiations between States and the implementation of miscellaneous decisions and agreements on disarmament. We are encouraged by the welcome given to these proposals by the international community  and we hope that they will make a contribution to the formulation of decisions aimed at action.In fact  the world thus far has lived in a state of balance of terror. Ironically  this balance has become a cause of great concern  as can be seen now that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in both quantity and quality has become almost uncontrollable  despite the system established by the Non-Proliferation Treaty.We should like to stress  in particular  the nuclear threat inherent at present in the racist regime of South Africa. Despite the fact that the country has not acceded to that Treaty  and the fact that it does not observe either the safeguard measures prescribed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or United Nations decisions to promote international peace and security  some members of the Assembly continue to collaborate in the strengthening of South Africa's nuclear capability. This collaboration  which continues to grow  is a flagrant violation of the historic Declaration on the denuclearization of Africa adopted in 1964 by the Heads of State or Government of the member countries of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  which was supported by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and by the United Nations.This collaboration continues despite the repeated requests of this Assembly to South Africa to refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons  and although the military ambitions of Pretoria are evident in numerous acts of aggression and destabilization against independent neighboring African countries which are now threatened by the use of such weapons. Continuing efforts  especially by the five nuclear Powers which are also permanent members of the Security Council  must be made to prevent South Africa from strengthening its nuclear capability  without an undertaking to that effect  there is a danger that all the measures taken thus far to promote the denuclearization of Africa will be nullified.Observance of the international commitment to the system prescribed by the Non-Proliferation Treaty is vitally important  as was stressed once again at the recent Geneva Conference by the States Parties to that Treaty  in promoting a general climate of peace and security. Cameroon believes that the decisions taken by the Conference should be rapidly translated into action so as to slow down the nuclear-arms race and thus give new impetus to disarmament.In this nuclear age  when mankind is continually under threat of total destruction if there is a generalized conflict  we can no longer allow ourselves to continue to enclose security within narrow limits or to minimize the imperative need for our collective security.It is encouraging in this connection that a ministerial regional Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was held this year in Togo at Lome  with broad participation at a high level on the topic of ""Security  disarmament and development"". That Conference adopted a Declaration on security  disarmament and development in Africa and a program of action for peace  security and co-operation in Africa  which were recently endorsed by the Ministerial Meeting of Non-Aligned Countries. The convening of that Conference  the first of its kind inAfrica  and the adoption of the Declaration and Program of Action  clearly show the determination of Africa to be in the vanguard in the quest for peace. My delegation supports the Declaration and the Program of Action of that important meeting and calls for the support of the international community with a view to its speedy implementation.Cameroon also supports the steps now being taken to arrange an international conference on disarmament and development. The first session of the Preparatory Committee was recently held here in New York.What we need urgently is an active search for non-nuclear  non-military security measures  but in so doing we must also actively seek to promote conventional disarmament in the multilateral context of the United Nations and in accordance with the guidelines  the specific rules and the principles contained in the Final Document which was adopted at the first special session of our Assembly  devoted to disarmament  held in 1978  and which was confirmed during the session held in 1982 on the same subject.Like the profound disagreement which persists in the area of disarmament  the critical international economic and social situation is a cause of grave concern about the future of mankind. In the past 40 years  trade between nations has increased because of the growing interdependence resulting from the progress of science and technology  in particular in the area of communications.Thanks to the mechanisms of the United Nations system  which have given appreciable support to the efforts made by Governments  the conditions of life in a large number of countries have been improved  particularly in the developing countries  in the fields of health  education  agriculture and so on. However  it remains true that international trade is still characterized by marked imbalances and flagrant injustice  which have led to a great gulf between nations and growing dependence for the developing countries.The efforts of those countries to create a more just and equitable international economic order have always been frustrated by the selfishness and the lack of political will  of the rich countries.In fact the attitude of those countries can be held responsible for the mediocre results of the third United Nations Development strategy  the sidetracking of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of states  adopted in 1974 by our Assembly  the impasse in the global negotiations  the delay in implementing the agreement to establish a common fund for basic commodities  and the delaying tactics used to put off the convening of an international conference on currency  financing and development.Although there has been some modest and uneven growth in the industrial countries  growth in the developing countries has been practically non-existent and and has had no effect. So we can affirm that while the threat to the world economy is serious  in the developing countries there is a real economic crisis. The threat is characterized  inter alia  by the gradual disintegration of the trade system  uncertainty and instability in the international financial and monetary system  the persistent problem of the external debt  the stagnation in public aid to development and the critical economic situation at present in Africa south of the Sahara.With regard to Africa  which has the largest number of the least developed countries  we welcome the adoption by the Assembly last year of the Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa. This represents the clearly defined political framework within which the international community intends to deal with the crisis in Africa. Since its adoption  a slight improvement has gradually taken place in some parts of the region  thanks to international assistance. However  the emergency needs are far from being met. In addition  the short-term and long-term needs have still not received all the international attention requested in the Declaration.The African countries are aware  and have always recognized  that the solution of their problems rests primarily with themselves  in this spirit they have made commendable efforts to integrate their needs into their national development policies and programs. The Lagos Plan of Action adopted in 1980 and brought up to date at the twentieth summit meeting of the OAU in 1984 in Addis Ababa  should be viewed as an effort directed to the integrated development of Africa  in view of the acute crisis being experienced by the continent.However  it is also clear that the African countries cannot confront this serious crisis alone  without the assistance of the international community. Such assistance requires a continuing commitment  if the principles of the Declaration are to be translated into practical action.In this context  Cameroon supports the proposal for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to the economic crisis in Africa.This year once again  our Organization has played an active role in the implementation of the system provided for in the new Convention on the Law of the Sea.The past two sessions of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  held at Kingston and at Geneva  have made encouraging progress. They were characterized by efforts to draw up rules of procedure for the Assembly of the Authority  by the determination of members of the Commission to pave the way for the effective creation of the Enterprise as the Authority's organ responsible for the exploitation of the sea-bed through the examination of problems which could affect the land-based producer developing States as a result of the exploitation of the sea-bed and  lastly  by the preparation of the rules of procedure for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.Unfortunately  despite general support for the development of a peaceful system governing the exploitation of the sea-bed  the search for machinery which would make the Enterprise operational and viable remains unsuccessful. In addition  the implementation of resolution II on the rights and obligations of pioneer investors prior to the entry into force of the Contention has been blocked until this problem of overlapping zones is resolved between the parties concerned.At the same time the developed countries  whose financial and technological resources are needed for the proper exploitation of the sea-bed  continue to engage in blackmail by demanding that the Commission should grant them a mining regime which is favorable to them  but which would run counter to the relevant provisions of the Convention. We strongly condemn this action  just as we joined with the Group of 77 in deploring the recent decision by one State to grant licenses to a few of its consortium for the exploration and exploitation of certain sectors of the zone in violation of the provisions of the Convention and related resolutions.However  it is encouraging to note that an overwhelming majority of Member States of the United Nations have signed the Convention  and that a growing number of them  including Cameroon  have ratified it. This trend reveals the growing recognition of the right of all States  rich or poor  weak or powerful  to benefit from the judicious exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed through an equitable legal regime whose nature is of crucial importance for international peace and security. For this reason  my delegation firmly supports the unambiguous implementation of the Convention and of its related resolutions.Such implementation must promote the joint management of the common heritage of mankind so as to improve social and human conditions throughout a world that is constantly being buffeted by international events.With regard to human rights  Cameroon's accession to most of the main international instruments in this field and its participation in the work of the Commission on Human Rights are evidence of its active commitment to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms. This commitment will be maintained.As for social and humanitarian problems  it is encouraging to note a convergence of views on the value of programs devoted to this subject in the United Nations. In this connection it would be desirable for the international community to continue its support of activities aimed at promoting the well-being of refugees  children  young people  the disabled  the elderly  women and migrant workers.Although the interdependence of nations is today broadly accepted. States do not always seem willing to assume all the implications of this principle as regards the establishment of specific machinery designed to improve the management of the common destiny of mankind. At present the United Nations is confronting a large number of difficulties and is the subject of such vehement criticism that some no longer hesitate to question the very future of the Organization in view of what would appear to be a regrettable decline of multilateralism.Whatever form such criticism takes  it in fact reflects people's concern about the control of decision-making machinery and indeed about the leadership of the Organization. However  a careful reading of the Charter  the development of the nature of the world and collective wisdom should enable us to rise above momentary difficulties despite the criticism leveled at our Organization.It would therefore be desirable for the Organization constantly to adapt its structures with a view to the democratization of international relations  so as to ensure the increasingly dynamic and equitable participation of all members of the international community in the conduct of world affairs. The fate of each and every one of us depends on it.During each of our sessions we uphold the interests of our respective States  and in taking up such positions we frequently give the impress ion that we expect everything from the United Nations. Has not the time come  during this historic session of its fortieth anniversary  to ask ourselves what we can do for the Organization to increase its effectiveness and dynamism and thereby to strengthen the role it plays for the benefit and well-being of mankind? The will to do so is required  and I should like to believe that we are capable of meeting this need."
"27",1427,"COD",40,1985,"My delegation would join in the condolences expressed to the Government and the people of Mexico in connection with the tragedy which has just befallen them and associates itself with any initiative taken by the international community to provide immediate assistance to the people and the Government of Mexico.I should like to join preceding speakers in congratulating the President most sincerely on my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation on bis election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. In this connection  I would assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation.I should also like to express ay great appreciation to his predecessor  an outstanding diplomat  His Excellency Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the competence and perseverance that he demonstrated during the thirty-ninth session and during the inter-sessional period.I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation for the dynamism and clear sightedness shown by the Secretary-General of our Organization  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  from the time that he assumed that post.On 4 October 1973( the Founder-President of the Popular Movement of the Revolution and President of the Republic  Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko  made a substantial contribution to the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly by conveying to the international community a message of peace and friendship from the people of Zaire as a whole as represented in Popular Movement of the Revolution.True to his belief in the ideals and purposes of the United Nations  President Mobutu Sese Seko  who has never missed any of the major gatherings of our Organization  including the twenty-fifth anniversary of our Organization  has undertaken personally to attend the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization.This commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  which coincides with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  takes place at a particularly troubled time in world history  when the antagonisms between the major Powers have been increasing  tension and confrontation have been aggravating this trend and a particularly acute economic crisis affects all developing countries in general  and Africa in particular  slowing down their growth and jeopardizing their very development.The international situation is worsened still further by an unbridled nuclear-arms race which threatens the survival t .mankind and increases the danger of a nuclear conflagration. The improvement and stockpiling of conventional weapons in any parts of the world  and particularly in the developing countries  provide a new dimension to the arms race  particularly in the case of States that have the largest Military arsenals.The massive supply of such weapons to States that base their philosophy on expansionism  domination and intervention in the internal affairs of other States increases the danger of confrontation between States and prompts such over-armed States to launch attacks and commit acts of aggression against other states less well-armed and therefore more vulnerable.This commemorative session on the fortieth anniversary offers the international community an opportunity for frankness  requiring a lucid and enlightened analysis of the international situation  in the light not only of the nuclear arms race  but also and above all of the sources of conflict among States  conflicts which have been increasingly frequent since the use of the last atom bomb. It is undeniable that more than 150 conflicts have arisen since the Second HOrld War  and many of them have occurred in third world countries.The collective security system as established by the Security Council and General Assembly should be reviewed and adapted to the wars that pit the states Members of our Organization one against another.The conflict between Iran and Iraq is a clear illustration of this approach  as are many other confrontations which are currently occurring in the world.In view of the many violations of the provisions of the United Nations Charter concerning international peace and security  the means the Charter provides for peaceful settlement of disputes should be strengthened so as to allow for more intensive consultations between the belligerents. Such a procedure would reduce tensions between the States in conflict and would facilitate conditions favorable to a lasting peace agreement  the aim being to make operational and effective the system of collective security.In fact  faced with many such cases occurring in Africa  Asia and Latin America over the last few years  the United Nations  which is supposed to ensure the independence and territorial integrity of all States  whether large or small  rich or poor  has not been able to take effective action to halt such conflicts. It was because of that sane inability that Zaire had to send its troops into Chad to assist that brother country in defending its sovereignty and also to defend the aspirations of its people to unity and territorial integrity.I believe that was a task which should have been carried out by the United Nations and  more specifically  by the Military Staff Committee  whose function is to advise and assist the Security Council on all questions relating to military requirements for the maintenance of international peace and security  the employment and command of forces placed at its disposals the regulation of armaments and possible disarmament  as provided for in Article 47 of the Charter.It is regrettable that this Military Staff Committee  although it does exist  and is supposed to act as policeman in all cases of threats to or breaches of the peace  has not yet been able to function  thus cutting off the system sounding the alert and ensuring the collective security provided for in the United Nations Charter.So it is easy to lay a special responsibility upon the permanent members of the Security Council who  moreover  signed the United Nations Charter in San Francisco and undertook to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war just after the Second world War.It is precisely this gap in the collective security system that enables the white minority in South Africa  under the leadership of Peter Botha  to indulge in barbaric acts which tragically recall the atrocities of the Nazis  against whom those same Powers now permanent members of the Security Council fought in the Second World War.The entire international community is aware of the cruelty and intolerance prevalent in South Africa today  so repugnant to the universal conscience. To suffer the policy of the extermination of black people through organized massacres and the humiliations going beyond all human understanding is the daily lot of the black people of South Africa  the only excuse for the commission of these barbaric acts being the color of their skin.The condemnation of such actions by the international community is strong and is sufficient proof that the threshold of tolerance for that regime has long been passed.My delegation fully appreciates the sanctions decided on by some developed countries against South Africa and we earnestly hope that these measures will be strengthened and constitute an example to be followed by all free peoples in the world  as an expression of their solidarity and their devotion to the concept of human dignity.The delegation of Zaire associates itself with all the other delegations uAich have called for the release of Nelson Mandela and condemned the many violations of the borders of the front-line countries  particularly those of Angola  by the rebel forces of South Africa. The absence of any political will on the part of the racist regime of South Africa to start negotiations with the representatives of the black people of South Africa  particularly the leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) is further proof of the obscurantism and the obstinate stubbornness of that regime in its refusal to move away from its policy of apartheid.The Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement  held in Luanda from 2 to 7 September 1985  proffered its moral  political and Material support to the black people in South Africa in their legitimate struggle and for the purpose of the intensification of the political mobilization of the masses within that country.That peace which is sought after in South Africa is also needed in Namibia where the Namibian people  mobilized in the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) under the clear-sighted leadership of Sam Njoma  its President  seek to free themselves from feSie illegal colonial occupation of their territory by the racist regime of South Africa. The United Nations  in terminating South Africa's Mandate to administer the territory  placed Namibia under its own direct authority. Despite many resolutions by the Security Council and the General Assembly calling on the South African regime to withdraw from Namibian territory. South Africa is still  on various false pretexts  trying to perpetuate its domination and exploitation of Namibia. The time has come for the United Nations to demonstrate pragmatism and effectiveness  and to take specific action to speed up the liberation of Namibia and enable its people to enjoy all the fundamental human freedoms.In the north Africa is faced with the problem of Western Sahara. My delegation believes that a final settlement of the question of the Western Sahara requires the holding of a free and democratic referendum on self-determination under United Nations auspices.For nearly 40 years now the United Nations has been dealing with the situation in the Middle East. The absence of dialog between the States in the region increases distrust and aggravates tensions. The very idea of peaceful coexistence within the context of a lasting peace  which should gradually win over the States of the region  in view of the efforts made by the United Nations and some States  is virtually non-existent today. Peace in the Middle East involves: respect for law  that is  the principles of international law relating to friendly relations and co-operation among States; recognition of the sovereignty of each State; respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of each State in the region and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force or war; and the guarantee of a just settlement of the problem of refugees.Resolution 3236 (XXIX) reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  and resolution 3237 (XXIX) recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. It is therefore the duty of the United Nations to ensure that law and justice prevail in the Middle East  it being understood of course that its mission is to replace the spirit of war and confrontation with the spirit of consultation and constructive dialog.Not far from that region  two brother countries  Iran and Iraq - both also members of the Non-Aligned Movement - are waging an unending war  causing great loss of human life and material destruction  without the United Nations being able to propose any approach that could lead to consultations directed towards negotiations on how best to halt the hostilities. My delegation would once more urgently appeal to the two brother countries  on the eve of International Peace Year  to seek an understanding in a spirit of reconciliation and fraternity.In Asia  the peoples of Democratic Kampuchea and Afghanistan also aspire to live in peace and independence  honor and national dignity. The sufferings inflicted on those peoples prevent them from concentrating on mobilizing their forces and their national resources to build a united country  neutral  non-aligned and prosperous.This tragedy must be ended through a just solution based on the restoration of the sovereignty of the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan and the total withdrawal of all foreign occupation troops from those territories.In Central America  we should encourage the implementation of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  in keeping with the wishes expressed by the States that signed the Act.During the four decades of existence of the United Nation a great change has taken place in international economic relations. The pluralism of the United Nations system  strengthened by its universality  has resulted in the creation of a series of economic  financial and commercial institutions and organizations dedicated to increasing multilateral co-operation.The increased participation of the developing countries in international trade has contributed to the expanded volume of trade between the industrialized and the developing countries. The efforts of developing countries to improve the living conditions of the peoples of the third world have encountered many obstacles. For example  export earnings often suffer the consequences of fluctuations in the prices of the products concerned  thus upsetting the development plans and programs of those countries. Then there are the demands made by the payment of public debts on maturity; the reduction of loan facilitators of the financing of development projects by ;he relevant financial agencies  not to mention soaring interest rates; and the transfer of technology  where the absence of any policy at the level of the United Nations system jeopardizes the chances of increasing the industrialization of those countries.In Zaire a program of economic  financial and social recovery  established in agreement with the International Monetary Fund  has been started and has permitted the repayment of our debts at a satisfactory rate. In the budgetary year 1984 alone  for example  Zaire paid off its medium- and long-term debt amounting to $328 million  although its actual capacity to repay  having regard to its export earnings  scarcely exceeds $250 million a year.That means that Zaire's commitment to meet its financial obligations continues  but it must not jeopardize the objectives of its economic and social development  for the repayment of debt should not prejudice the standard of living of the peoples of the third world and the investment necessary for the progress and development of those peoples.The developed countries should show solidarity with the developing countries in their approach to the debt question. My delegation welcomes the statement by the President of the French Republic  Mr. Francois Mitterand  on the initiative he intends to take to convene a meeting of the leaders of the richest countries of the East and the West and the representatives of the poorest countries of the world to discuss this question. We must recognize that at the level of our Organization  although the General Assembly adopted the International Development Strategies for the First  Second and Third United Nations Development Decades  so little progress has been made that at its thirty-ninth session the General Assembly declared that it was very disappointed that the Committee entrusted with the task of reviewing and appraising the application of the Strategy for the present Decade had not been able to carry out its duties owing to a lack of positive  concrete elements.Furthermore  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  adopted in 1974  is still being studied to see what measures can best be taken to implement it.The General Assembly also adopted in 1974 the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order based on justice and equity. The restructuring of international economic relations was to be discussed between the underdeveloped and the developed countries within the framework of global negotiations  but unfortunately that North-South dialog has not taken place because of the intransigence of certain industrialized countries  which  being well-off  refuse to consider the demands of the developing countries in that regard.The acute economic crisis affecting the third world  and Africa in particular  results from the present inadequate economic and monetary system  and should lead Member States to show more solidarity and co-operation in making a better world for all peoples. In that connection  my delegation calls on the wealthy nations involved in competition in outer space  in an unbridled nuclear arms race and in star wars to come down to earth and to devote their surplus resources to meeting the pressing  immediate needs of man and his survival.The Republic of Zaire has great faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and undertakes to comply with them  as it has always done in the past.As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  the delegation of Zaire associates itself with all the ideas of peace  development and complementarity expressed by other Member States in calling for their realization  for the good of all mankind.Our Organization should emerge from the celebration of the fortieth anniversary as an instrument truly at the service of the general interest of the international community  of peace  justice and equity for all Member States  large and small  rich and poor.The future prospects for our Organization therefore involve a strengthening of its role* not only with regard to international peace and security or the liberation of oppressed peoples so that they may achieve self-determination  but also to build a better world in which the peoples enjoy a better quality of life."
"28",1473,"COG",40,1985,"He express our sympathy to the people of Mexico whose capital city was recently shaken by violent earthquakes.The 40 years experience of the United Nations Charter which has considerably enriched international life constitute for this century now coming to an end an important stage  a moment of historical importance  which we must be proud to honor. We should do so because the United Nations  with its good and bad points  has today become a disciplined adult in fairly good health.My country  whose rebirth in freedom and sovereignty dates from the moment when the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  finds in these 40 years of the Charter and the 2 5 years of resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 more than a happy coincidence.In retrospect  it might be considered that history in a spectacular movement towards orderly behavior by the actors on the world stage has finally succeeded in remodeling  to a very large extent  the map of the world as we see it today  reflected in this very place by the irreversible universalization of ourOrganization.Happily the balance-sheet of that development will be drawn up under the very competent and wise authority of Ambassador de Pinies. His unanimous choice for the presidency confirms  for us  the great merit and experienced qualities of a statesman and diplomat that he possesses. There can be no doubt that under his wise direction the fortieth session of the General Assembly will mark an important stage in the life of our Organization.Furthermore  for the Congolese delegation his capacity as the representative of Spain identifies him with a part of Europe that has long been at the crossroads of civilization and has predisposed it to support the kind of international co-operation that is reflected in the co-operation existing between our two countries. Consequently it goes without saying that my delegation will give him its complete support throughout his term.My delegation wishes also to join the many speakers who have bestowed well-merited praise on his predecessor for the authority and effectiveness he displayed during his time as President of the Assembly at its thirty-ninth session.May I also renew to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the interest and confidence that the People's Republic of the Congo has in the efforts he has undertaken in order to render more effective the functioning of the United Nations system and enable it fully to meet its responsibilities in the face of the serious problems threatening international peace and security.In his brilliant report on the work of the Organization  our Secretary-General placed particular emphasis en th-a idea of international authority by demonstrating the requirements for such authority in terms of international co-operation. This concept implies  indeed  the idea of multilateralism in its fullest and most dynamic form  in order to justify the collective responsibility we have assumed under the standards and principles of the Charter  whose purposes and objectives we are duty-bound to promote.It is an irony of fate that as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary the most obvious signs of a situation that is in many respects of great concern manifest themselves throughout the entire fabric of international relations  covering even our most predictable prospects with great uncertainty.Indeed  today famine  hunger and poverty are raging in numerous countries with greater intensity than ever. Today we count almost 30 million Africans caught in acrisis in which the vagaries of fate  such as drought and desertification  remain intractable in spite of the responsibilities of man and his systems.We continue to experience even today how difficult it is for the developed pact of the world to accept that underdevelopment is not in any way decreed by nature and that concerted and resolute action can overcome it.Multilateralism should not always imply - as is so often the case - solidarity that is perceived only in terms of trade. That necessarily leads to under-utilization of enormous intellectual  technological and other possibilities which could be allocated by the world today to the most fundamental human needs.Because of this reality  and although our Organization was conceived when taking into account the sum total of the lessons drawn from the most atrocious world war  the 40 years of the United Nations cannot be celebrated everywhere in the same serene atmosphere. War continues to be the lot of many nations; and the arms race does not spare even outer space.With regard to human rights and the right to self-determination of peoples  the odious system of apartheid continues to rage in South Africa  while unjustifiable obstacles are constantly raised in the path towards independence for Namibia  The peoples of Nicaragua  Western Sahara  Palestine and many other regions daily undergo the harmful effects of the policy of aggression  domination and division pursued by the imperialist Powers.The persistence - and at times worsening - of some of the ills the United Nations was meant to cure  or at least prevent or contain  often places the United Nations at the center of difficulties heaped upon it not without malice by some States concerned above all with their own interests and opposed to co-operation advantageous to all  and this in spite of their participation in drafting joint decisions.In this international situation of serious concern  there arc everywhere hotbeds of tension that are being maintained purposely in order to broaden spheres of influence by imposing foreign military bases on peaceful populations and ensuring protectorates in disguise. Trampling upon international rules and conventions  the colonialist  imperialist  expansionist and racist Powers have built a veritable system of irregular  illegal and immoral practices. Armed acts of aggression  occupation of the territory of other States and military interventions remain the means by which they impose their authority and bring about the triumph of their selfish and hegemonic interests to the detriment of the self-determination of peoples.In the economic field  monetary disorder  galloping inflation  surging interest rates  unsustainable disequilibrium in balances of payments  growing indebtedness - all constitute the main features of our time  with increased deterioration in the terms of trade which are dangerously eroding expected revenues in developing countries.My delegation believes that only global negotiations can correct the international economic situation and lead to the establishment of a new international economic order. By emphasizing in its conclusions the need to work out more equitable relations between the North and the South  the Eighth Conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Non-Aligned Countries  which was just held at Luanda  Angola  merely reflected the conviction of the developing countries in this regard.In this struggle for development and the establishment of relations of co-operation among peoples  science and information roust take pride of place as indispensable factors for the maintenance of peace and security. They must be put at the service of development and the total blossoming of mankind  instead of serving to alienate and destroy humanity through the arms race and subversion.It is the duty of the international community to support the efforts of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system  and in particular of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  to draft general policies and programs favorable to setting up a new world information order and promoting the science and technology necessary to the solution of development problems in third-world countries. on these questions  relations between the countries of the North and the South would benefit were they to develop along the lines of a better knowledge of the world's resources and of progress for all mankind.For some the United Nations should neither manage nor guarantee the general interests or the most legitimate aspirations of the international community  which is tantamount to returning to the doctrine of might makes right that prevailed generally in past centuries. Each day we see manifestations of this attitude in the economic field  where the protectionism of dominant Powers prevents any equitable redistribution of the planet's resources  above all when such protectionism is based on an unpredictable monetary system and arbitrary interest rates.If the supervisory role conferred upon the United Nations by the Charter had been fully recognized by Member States  much of the paralysis in the lives of nations would be reduced to the minimum. Instead of a commitment in this direction  all that has been proposed thus far has been temporary assistance machinery or loans that generate indebtedness for most developing countries.To illustrate the numerous difficulties facing young nations in their determination and efforts towards development  I shall speak of the case of my own country.The People's Republic of the Congo has wide sustained effort to carry out its five-year economic and social development plan (1982-1986) in a world economic situation governed by the factors I have just mentioned  Now  there is no regular flow of financial resources nor any remunerative market for the raw materials we produce which constitute our only source of revenue. Hence* it is difficult to avoid indebtedness and the shackles of debt servicing.If creditors and debtors could at least  as loyal  equally responsible partners  study suitable means of making this debt supportable by viewing it on a long-tern basis that would maintain macro-economic and social balance in the debtor countries  and guarantee healthy condition of growth and stability  it would certainly be to everyone's benefit.That is why  in order to ensure the continuation of the development plan during an increasingly stagnant international situation  the Central Committee of the Congolese Workers Party  under the leadership of President Sassou-Nguesso  has decided to proceed with the adoption of a program of structural adjustment which will enable us to adapt the execution of essential  priority projects to the resources available. In so doing we remain open to outside co-operation in the hope that our partners of yesterday  today and tomorrow will remain so not only in periods of relative prosperity but also  and above all  when temporary difficulties arise.The Peoples Republic of the Congo  a land of peace and harmony  is militantly in favor of establishing a climate of mutually advantageous understanding and co-operation in its relations with its economic partners  strengthening the links of friendship and brotherhood with our neighbors and subordinating national selfishness to the creation of an integrated economic region in central Africa on the basis of the understanding and solidarity cherished by our peoples.The will to peace of the Peoples Republic of the Congo  which is fiercely defended by its people  its Government and its President  has led to the bestowal on my country of  inter alia  the presidency of the Economic Community of Central African States. It has also been entrusted with delicate missions of arbitration in the settlement of the question of Chad  which has been characterized by a fratricidal war with dire consequences for the people of Chad.The special sympathy and attention which the international community and  especially  Central Africa and the organization of African Unity (OAU) have shown to my country by entrusting it with these missions of great significance for the promotion of peace and international co-operation are the fruit of the constant efforts of President Sassou-Nguesso to consolidate peace and to strengthen relationships of good-neighborliness in the region and throughout Africa.To the extent that past experience teaches us what we have been able to do as compared with what we ought to have achieved  let us try at least to be inspired by the theme of this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  ""United Nations for a better world""  and organize our solidarity accordingly. Certain trains of thought focused on the year 1985 as a whole invite us to do this.He in Africa  in particular  in addition to the memory of the 25 years of resolution 1514 (XV)  of 14 December 1960  which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  are also thinking about the centenary of the Act of Berlin which in 1885 put our continent at the mercy of European imperialist ambitions  to be subjugated and exploited.In its final resolution  an international seminar held in Brazzaville this year to commemorate this unhappy one-hundredth anniversary of the balkanization of Africa  exhorted Africans to go beyond a narrow national outlook to catch a glimpse  beyond the frontiers of states  of the fundamental bases of unity and the rebirth of Africa.The demand for freedom and dignity emerging from that commemoration leaves no doubt as to our determination to eradicate the apartheid regime from African soil. The echoes throughout the world of the struggle being carried on there  in spite of the oppression by the minority in power and its continuing acts of aggression against neighboring countries  confirm this determination to destroy apartheid  rather than reform it  as those in Pretoria imagine they can do.This is also true of the liberation of the colonial territory of Namibia  which is still illegally occupied by South Africa. There can be no doubt that we condemn the gratuitous act of aggression against the territory of the Peoples Republic of Angola by the hand-pressed racist Power  an act which was the subject of Security Council resolution 571 (1985)  adopted on 20 September this year. As a ward of the United Nations  Namibia  whose case has been on our agenda since the inception of the Organization  has the right to be freed  in keeping with the plan of action in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).with regard to the possibilities for establishing conditions of peace elsewhere in Africa  in the area or in countries which are most sorely tried  these remain entirely valid. To this end  a general attitude of non-interference would seem to us to be one of the essential factors  and should be encouraged.We are sharing this year with the rest of the world the beneficial effects of the celebration of International Youth Year. Youth must not only be involved in United Nations action to imbue it with generosity but must  above all  be conceived of and seen as the ultimate user of the products of the better world which the United Nations hopes to achieve.Finally  a better world is not possible without the full and effective participation of women  whose Decade was celebrated a few months ago in Nairobi by the adoption of future strategies of action to promote its aims. The success of that Conference  in spite of many differences of opinion  is surely a good augury and shows a promising awareness of the need for the equal development and peace which all of us are capable of achieving  free of any prejudice or discrimination.All the effort and commitment of all of us are needed to build the road to peace. This  for us  means both psychological and practical mobilization. The effects of the year 1986  which has been proclaimed the international Year of Peace  will depend in large part on the real choices mads by States big or small  weak or powerful  to promote the conditions necessary for our common survival.In this context  as the Secretary-General says in his report  ""international co-operation  however complex and difficult to organize  is not a choice for the nations of the world  but a necessity"". (A/40/1  p. 5) International co-operation encompasses both preventive dimensions and a constructive aspect. By prevention we would be better able to organize our security  not only by regular monitoring of the applications of science - whose development is becoming dangerously fast for the immediate perception of the ordinary man - but also by greater sharing of responsibility at the world level. Such participation could result in filling the undesirable gap that exists between the spirit of a charter made to promote harmony and unanimity - especially in the Security Council - and the dangerous reality that a minority of states  without a mandate  hold the fate of all nations in their hands  thereby distorting any approach to a system of collective security.The commemoration of the birth of the United Nations does not in any way lead us to forget that 40 years ago  at the time of the victory over fascism  the world entered the nuclear era. Thus we also commemorate the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since that time  and in spite of the nuclear Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  not only has no Power that initiated that Treaty shown the slightest will to disarm under effective international control  but  on the contrary  the nuclear weapon has spread almost to the point of falling  with the agreement of certain major Powers  as we all know  even into the hands of South Africa  which is a direct heir to the Nazi tradition.Forty years ago it was virtually Inconceivable that soma 10 years later  beginning with the Bandung Conference  whose thirtieth anniversary we commemorated last April  there would emerge a new awareness leading to the policy of non-alignment. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been trying since that time to make the international community  including the United Nations  regain that sense of true peace  free from antagonisms and from the search for spheres of influence  a peace based on the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes  on the pursuit of greater well-being for all the inhabitants of our planet and on the establishment of equality and justice.To be sure  the united Nations system as a whole is already a vast synthesis of all the universal aspirations in practically all fields: political  economic  human and cultural} it is also a solid basis for building a better world that transcends national or regional limitations.We must strive to safeguard the achievements of the past 40 years and to build upon them.Among those achievements is the whole gamut of conventions which stemmed more or less directly from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and which protect workers  children  the physically handicapped and the aged.We welcome the legitimate support thus far given by the United Nations to those fighting in the liberation movements  willing to sacrifice their lives to achieve the fundamental rights to self-determination and freedom.These achievements denote above ail the value and flexibility of the Charter  which remains truly the treaty of treaties with no equal in all of human history and to which any other international commitment on the part of a Member State should be subordinate  under the terms of Article 103.We must preserve the Charter from any abusive interpretation of its provisions and even more from its use for partisan purposes. The Charter can be revised inorder to ensure its adaptation to the realities while at the same time maintaining its fundamental perspective as the cornerstone of any international policy.In so doing we have in mind the overriding need to make known the true image of the United Nations by world public opinion. The mass media do not always help in this  undoubtedly because they are excessively concentrated in the hands of a few pressure groups  almost all of them belonging to a limited number of countries. In this respect  the new international communications and information order should be the catalyst for a major peaceful battle at the international level  through the United Nations system  to promote comprehension and understanding among nations and peoples.It would indeed be inconsistent and dangerous to erect barriers between the United Nations and the peoples of the world.Although mankind often has to be subjected to utmost danger in order to find the necessary motivation to save itself  the past from which the United Nations has emerged is sufficiently rich in object lessons that no further trials are needed for us to demonstrate a commitment to our common survival.I shall borrow the final words of my intervention from the admirable recommendation made by the former Presidents of the General Assembly at their meeting held under the auspices of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) last June. They suggested to the Assembly that its""should seize this unique opportunity and devote its attention to the remaining 15 years of this century and  with a vision of the future  should initiate plans at the global level for the year 2000 and the beginning of the new millennium."" (A/40/377  para. 20)Indeed  it is no longer conceivable  in 1985  to live without the United Nations  much less to do without it in determining our near or distant future."
"29",1520,"COL",40,1985,"At the outset allow me to express Colombia's grief at the tragedy in Mexico. We wish to restate our solidarity with that fraternal people. Together with the Latin American Group we shall be sponsoring a draft resolution associating the United Nations with the efforts to deal with the disastrous events in that country.My country owes a great deal to Spain  as does mankind as a whole  which thanks to that country was enriched by the meeting of two major cultures five centuries ago.From the ancient times of Suarez and Vitoria  Spain was the founder of the law of nations. It is significant that the presidency of this fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly has been entrusted to one of its experienced diplomats  skilled in dealing with its items. I wish to convey to Mr. de Pinies the congratulations of the delegation I have the honor to head  with our wishes that his work will be as fruitful and meaningful as the anniversary we are commemorating this year.Mr. Perez de Cuellar  an illustrious Latin American and son of a brother country with which we maintain close links of friendship  conducts the work of our Organization with a skill and oven-handedness acknowledged by us all. His report will be a helpful guide in our discussions.This forum has been the stage from which  during four decades  men of all races and ideologies  who have built the contemporary world  have expressed their thinking and the will of their people in the difficult times of the age in which we are living. We have come here today to pay a tribute to what it represents as a symbol of men's will to live in peace with others.We must remind those who take a disdainful and skeptical view of the importance of the United Nations that it constitutes the best barrier against final destruction: a place for dialog and rational means of ironing out  on an equal footing  differences that might appear to be impossible to overcome.We wish to honor the memories of the United States President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  and the British Prime Minister  Sir Winston Churchill  who both expressed in the Declaration of the Atlantic their belief that ""the disarmament of the aggressor nations was essential until it was possible to come to establish a wide and permanent system of general safety"".That statement bore in it the seed of our Organization which later bore positive fruits for humanity. Its policy served to smother the embers left behind by the barbarism of the world wars; because this is where we strive to combat the war and destruction that have always been the harvest of the senselessness of the human race.It was the pride of the generation before us to raise the structure of this Organization; and  to our good fortune  it did so with a wide sense of co-operation  of respect for the views of the small countries which  like us  in the daily exercise of a practice that became enshrined in legislation  appealed to law to bring controversies to an end. For the first time in history  our views were sought and we had a right to speak and to vote  in order to lay the foundations of a new era. Gone were the days when Powers took authoritarian decisions on the absolute control of peoples and regions.The Latin American States stoutly defended the regional agencies that had long been at work and  it pleases me to recall  on the initiative of the Colombian delegation attending the San Francisco Conference the rule of good will in the fulfillment of the obligations and duties of all the members of the new community was included. Throughout these 40 years  succeeding Colombian delegations have reaffirmed the spirit of the founders of the United Nations. In that period there has been evidence of antagonistic positions on the means to ensure the primacy of reason over force  of law over arbitrariness  of freedom over all forms of slavery. However  my country has always favored dialog as the means to settle differences between opposing positions  considering that it is better for the world to witness j the clash of dissenting ideas than that of arms.The true revolutionary aspect of the system established by the victorious Powers after the Second World War was that it created a machinery accessible to all where the rule of numbers was imposed  that is  decision making through the oldest and most democratic of powers  that of majorities  which best expresses the will of nations.We were therefore opposed  during the San Francisco Conference  to the inclusion of the veto right in Security Council decisions. Our delegation explained the reasons why Colombia voted against the Yalta formula. It was evident that the noting system proposed would place questions of war and peace in the hands of one of the five Powers  contradicting the principle by which the problems of the international Organization should be resolved by simple majority.In that regard  former President Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo  the head of our delegation  stated:""The veto means that the interests of five major Powers shall be subjected to the will of one Power. The result will always be an agreement not to act. This lack of action will cause the Council and the great Powers to lose prestige  and will lead to the decline of the Organization. It is unwise to make future amendment impossible"". We may now be sufficiently mature for the creation of a compulsory international jurisdiction that will lead countries to the peaceful settlement of all their controversies. Thus we should bring more clarity to one of its essential principles: the equality of all States.The moral strength of the United Nations is based on the fact that in it are represented all the peoples of the world. Thus  no one questions its legitimacy  and no State should impose its law over and above a clearly established order that seeks  by definition  respect and equality.Far beyond any selfish considerations  therefore  we must preserve and defend the Organization and the wide range of agencies to which it has given rise  agencies that have brought to many places in the world the succor of their activities to combat hunger and disease  to disseminate knowledge  to protect children  refugees  employment and the environment  and to struggle for development.A result of this commemorative session must be a strengthening of this moral force so that its beneficial action can  as it has over the past four decades  prevent a conflict between the super-Powers from leading us to disaster.That is why Colombia belongs to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries: Our membership has its basis in a historic tradition rooted in our very quest for freedom. Our political beliefs encompass principles advocating the right of all peoples to choose their own path of progress  respect for the self-determination of each country  and pluralistic co-operation preventing confrontations such as those generated by a policy of blocs.In our view  the time has come to delete all references to ""enemy States"" from various Articles of the Charter; they constitute a true anachronism in view of the political make-up of the present world  which has overcome the ruins which separated the fighters of the great war.It is only natural that mankind should be unable to forget the Hiroshima holocaust  except in the beautiful way that that city has chosen to do so: not in a spirit of retaliation or vengeance  but as a living testament to what another nuclear tragedy could bring.The Charter of the United Nations was drafted with the intention of eliminating the hardships then endured by the human race. He are now experiencing a new wave of attacks against human dignity which have gravely jeopardized that intention in today's world. I speak of terrorism  whose defiance and destruction daily claim a greater number of innocent victims all over the world. States must take more effective action to fight this crime  which claims political aspects. The international community cannot shirk the determination of Member States to impose sanctions against those harboring movements which commit such reprehensible acts as the kidnapping of the daughter of President Duarte of El Salvador.This new kind of warfare - so appropriately called the ""dirty war"" because of its cowardice and unfairness - is a greater scourge upon mankind than conventional warfare itself. While our Organization has begun consideration of this subject -as a fitting homage to the anniversary we are commemorating - we should undertake to sign a convention against terrorism.We were surprised to note recently that developed countries refrained  on the basis of the questionable argument of its cost  from supporting the Secretary-General's proposal to call a meeting of plenipotentiaries to deal with the subject of drug trafficking. We wish to place on record that our position in this matter is to support any initiative towards that end  for this traffic is a threat to the integrity of mankind.Colombia reiterates its decision to combat this scourge. In fact  we are doing so together with many other countries  and with all of our neighbors. At the recent meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Andean Group - whose members are Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela - we agreed to work on a multilateral agreement to supplement existing bilateral agreements  which will bear the name of our former Minister of Justice  Rodrigo Lara Bonilia  who was infamously murdered for his struggle against drug trafficking. We intend in this way to strengthen international action against the narcotics trade.We stress the thesis that the limitation of conventional weapons is essential for developing countries  since it is with such weapons that they fight both at the domestic level and among one smother. It is time for the international community to confront this question  which involves so many vested interests. Thus  we have raised the question several times at the Organization of American States  but we consider that this is not an exclusively regional subject.Clearly  we must express our best wishes for the success of the Geneva talks on the incrementation of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and for the achievement of new agreements which will enable mankind to live in the certainty that this fragile voyager in space - Earth - will not be annihilated by the demented games of the great Powers.Moreover  we favor a greater number of denuclearized zones  such as those established in Latin America by the Treaty of Tlatelolco and those proposed for the Indian Ocean  Africa and the Antarctic.To complete the task of decolonization  the United Nations must bring about the independence of Namibia  with which Colombia reiterates its solidarity. In no way can we acknowledge the government installed by South Africa to inherit its colonialist legacy; in this connection  our Organization has taken decisions guaranteeing the self-determination of the Namibian people. We shall fight all necessary diplomatic battles until freedom and justice are restored in that esteemed African Territory.A blemish persists on this planet: Racial discrimination is still present in South Africa. The latest events in that country have once again shown the truth about the infamous Pretoria regime  which  in the words of Pope John Paul II  undermines the entire human race.He reaffirm the need for both Argentina and Great Britain to return to the negotiating table and resume the dialog that will enable them to reconcile Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands with the interests of the islanders.It pleases us to see that talks between the two Koreas have been resumed  along with exchanges of visits by economic  sporting and Red Cross groups from both countries. He are convinced that the peaceful route of mutual understanding is the only way to come to a satisfactory agreement.He also express our firm hope that a just and viable solution will be found for the question of Cyprus  in conformity with United Nations resolutions; we renew our support for the mission undertaken by the Secretary-General in this connection.It was 10 years ago in this very Assembly that Colombia first stated its position with regard to the rights of equatorial States such as ours in the synchronous geostationary orbit. Since then  we have participated intensively in the appropriate forums to obtain universal acceptance of our theses  based on an assertion of our sovereignty and on the search for equity in the framework of a new body of space law  which was inaugurated only in 1957  with the launching of the first SPUTNIK and which covers one of the most breath-taking adventures of twentieth-century man.Colombia looks forward to an open door on active and equitable international co-operation  taking into account the rights of developing countries and the special geographical location of the equatorial nations.The idea is that access to this limited natural resource will serve to close  not widen  the technological gap in space  as one of the elements that must define the new international economic order for which we are striving.Extremely important decisions have been taken during these 10 years; more specifically  at Vienna at the United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE-82)  where the main principles of equity were laid down for the peaceful use of the geostationary orbit in the service of all mankind  and not only of the great space Powers.At the Conference of Plenipotentiaries of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Nairobi  also held in 1982  on the basis of a proposal by Colombia  articles 10 and 33 of the International Telecommunication Convention were modified to permit an equitable  efficient and economic use of the geostationary satellite orbit  taking into account the specific needs of developing countries and the special geographical location of certain countries.In the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space  Colombia  together with Ecuador  Kenya and Indonesia  submitted a draft containing principles designed to permit establishing special set of legal rules for the geostationary orbit  a draft regarded by the developing countries as the basis for negotiations to establish a sui generis legal regime that takes into account the technical  legal and economic aspects of the problem.Recently  the Conference on the use of the orbit and the planning of the space services that would use it  convened by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva  declared itself incompetent to decide on our sovereign rights in the orbit  and it empowered the Secretary-General of that United Nations specialized agency to address the Secretary-General of the United Nations and  through him  the Committee on Outer Space  in order to have this basic question analyzed and defined.We have thus entered a new stage in which the United Nations will be able to confirm  as in the case of the law of the sea  its capacity to reassert the sovereignty of countries occupying a specific geographical location.In recent years we have helplessly witnessed a process of deterioration in multilateral co-operation as a result of the growing preference of States for bilateral relationships from which they expect to obtain political and even economic dividends. Multilateralism is the most appropriate and fair mechanism for disseminating the products of generosity and goodwill to the neediest countries  without any form of conditions or discrimination.There has been an unfortunate weakening of some United Nations agencies that have rendered invaluable services to humanity in the past as a result of the application by many developed countries of the criterion of zero growth in their contributions to those agencies. That has forced the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  for example  drastically to reduce the World Food Program (WFP)  at the very time when the entire world is witness to one of the most dreadful famines ever experienced. We should perhaps follow the example of those young singers who have placed themselves at the service of this cause and for whom compassion has no color or political slogans.International trade is the outstanding means of co-operation through which wealth and resources could be more efficiently distributed. Multilateral action co-ordinated through agencies such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  and mechanisms such as the Generalized System of Preferences  should provide us with the international economic environment needed for economic development.It is essential to halt the alarming deterioration in the terms of trade of developing countries - mainly the result of the fall in real prices of their commodities  many of which have fallen to levels never before seen in this century.We must do away with the protectionism that is spreading to all corners of the world  found especially in the industrialized countries which have now embarked on the harshest of trade wars - as was recognized only yesterday by the Ministers of Finance of the five most developed countries - without considering the consequences for the world economy  and above all for third world countries.The United Nations cannot play a secondary role nor act after the fact in conflicts arising as a result of a lack of solutions for under-development and poverty. The United Nations cannot ignore the surreptitious moves to nullify measures to enable us to come closer to a new international economic order  as for example in the case of the various Decades for Development  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  or UNCTAD resolutions.The same powers granted to it for the very effective struggle against colonialism must be extended to regulate the machinery and practices now used to manipulate the great economic differences between States. The same decisive action must be undertaken in the commercial and monetary spheres  which cannot be regarded as an area reserved for the consolidation of inequality and the predominance of power.We hope that the next round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will contribute to overcoming the crisis and the inclusion of concepts that will benefit developing countries.An erroneous view is often no more than a truth stated before its time. When discussing the Treaty of Versailles  Lord Keynes  the representative of the British Government  declared that if Germany was to be squeezed  it was vital that it should not be ruined  and he proposed that President Wilson should launch a vast financial program to save Europe. The United States Treasury was horrified at the proposal. However  30 years later  a similar scheme  the Marshall Plan  was accepted  making use too late of a scheme that  if adopted in time  could have prevented the Second World War.Authoritative voices have recently been heard proposing something similar for Latin America  where the most serious problem is no doubt the heavy burden of its foreign debt. Let us hope that those voices are heeded in time  and not after a cataclysm has occurred  as the President of Brazil has so eloquently warned us night happen.Mr. Henry Kissinger  referring to the Latin American debt  has stated that ""... the dialog with debtor countries should change from the collection of interest to the task of economic development ..."" and that  otherwise ""... there would sooner or later be a collapse  not only of the foreign debt structure but of the political institutions of Latin America and co-operation in the Western Hemisphere would be seriously jeopardized"".That thinking coincides with some of the guidelines contained in the Cartagena Consensus  of which Colombia  together with 10 other debtor countries of the region  was a promoter and founder. In that document we stated that the foreign debt is an obligation individually contracted by each specific country  and thus it should be treated on a case-by-case basis. However  the problem amounts to more than mere accounting and banking arrangements  because of the social and political effects of the debt servicing and the drastic depressive results of the adjustment processes.That is why it is essential that as proposed by the Presidents of the 11 countries at the recent Bonn summit  the establishment of a political dialog between debtor and creditor countries in order to overcome this problem in a real and permanent way be no longer delayed.In the present circumstances  Latin America must pay 800 billion dollars in the next 15 years on account of its debt. This level of servicing will absorb a large portion of domestic savings and the inflow of foreign exchange  to the extent that it is impossible to expect an increase in the per capita income of the 380 million Latin Americans in the next 15 years. That would make development impossible. Therefore Latin America must cease to be an exporter of capital and internal savings.Colombia  which has always honored its debt  has already reached a complete agreement with its creditors  guaranteed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  which enables it to obtain fresh resources destined for major productive projects  such as the exploitation of our large fields of coal  oil and ferro-nickel  and for the reactivation of our foreign trade.We have adopted a process of self-discipline  monitored by the Fund  which has already begun to reactivate our economy.We are fully aware that the problem of the Latin American foreign debt remains and that the arrangements made so far through tremendous effort on the part of some countries cure just temporary solutions. As indicated by the President of Colombia  Belisario Betancur  the debt bomb has not yet been deactivated.The countries of the region cannot consult their income from exports beyond the levels required for their productive activity and for the gradual improvement of the living standards of their peoples.Throughout this year Colombia  together with Mexico  Panama and Venezuela  the other members of the Contadora Group  has continued to work intensively and to offer its co-operation to the Central American countries to bring about the signing of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation. The difficulties that have arisen in the negotiations sponsored by the Group have not been serious enough to overcome the craving for peace  but they have caused delay in reaching agreement.He regret the recent incidents along the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua and between the latter and Honduras  which indicate the need to expedite the process of negotiation and to maintain channels of communication between the countries so as to overcome problems through dialog. The Contadora Group has reiterated its willingness to provide its co-operation and good offices in the search for permanent solutions to this type of incident  which hampers the good relations that should exist between States.The Contadora Group has had the support and admiration of the Latin American Governments  and  in general  the community of nations. I must highlight here the important event that took place in cur Cartegena de Indias on 24 and 25 August last when the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Contadora Group met with their colleagues from Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  who had established themselves as a support group in Lima  to consider the working modalities that they could offer the Contadora Group.This is the clearest proof of the political will of Latin America and of its desire and ability to devise a strategy of its own for resolving regional problems. That meeting gave evidence of Latin America's solidarity with the countries of Central America and its concern over the Central American crisis. It was decided to encourage the rapid completion of the negotiation process under way  since that crisis necessarily affects the future of our hemisphere. The meeting constituted a positive and unquestionable reinforcement of the work of the Contadora Group.The eight Foreign Ministers agreed on the urgent need to tackle actual and potential conflicts and acknowledged that these have their origin in social and economic imbalances and the structures that restrict the freedom of speech and the participation of the people in true political processes that reflect the essential expectations of every society.The response to the present economic situation in Central America has had as one of its most positive elements the participation of the European Economic Community (EEC). This example of international co-operation fosters our hopes and encourages the negotiating effort; to which we are committed. This coming November  a new meeting of the Community will take place in Luxembourg with the participation of the Foreign Ministers of Central America and the Contadora Group. At that meeting the Community will formally demonstrate its support for the cause of peace by specific agreements aimed at ensuring the economic development of Central America.We are battling against time. Thus  on 12 and 13 September last  at the meeting held in Panama with the Foreign Ministers of Central America  the Contadora Group delivered the final draft of the Act  which included the observations made by the Central American Governments on the text of 7 September 1984  which was submitted to the last session of the General Assembly. This exemplary legal instrument sets the basis for peaceful coexistence and encompasses comprehensive agreements which are a result of the consensus of the Governments of the isthmus.Aware of the deterioration of the regional situation  we agreed to convene a final meeting of plenipotentiaries for 7 October to discuss  during a 45-day term that may not be extended  only those aspects of the Act that are pending in relation to the control and reduction of arms  the implementation and follow-up mechanisms in matters of politics and security  and military maneuvers  and to negotiate the operational aspects essential to the fulfillment of the commitments entered into. The Foreign Ministers of Central America also agreed that any incidents that might occur in the region should not be the subject of negotiation by the plenipotentiaries or condition the holding of the meeting  in order to guarantee its effectiveness.Thus  we expect that once this stage of the negotiations is completed we shall be able to sign the Contadora Act in a joint Foreign Ministers conference. Regarding our work during the past year  we shall submit our report to the Secretary-General in keeping with the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session.We wish to reiterate in this forum today our call to countries with interests in the region to contribute  with understanding of and respect for the standards of international law and the self-determination of peoples  to the consolidation of peace  freedom and development  the ultimate goals of our efforts. As stated by the President of Colombia  Belisario Betancur ""we seek in Central America countries that realize their own being in a peace that is more arduous than war itself.""This is why it is encouraging to note that the democratic processes in our hemisphere have expressed themselves in a movement towards pluralistic societies characterized by participation in the voting process and free election of their Governments. This process has gained force during the current year and is in total agreement with the free political processes that have been practiced by Colombia for many years and have served as a means of expressing the differences and tensions characteristic of every society in evolution. A great pontiff of the Church taught us that""Man possesses an intrinsic dignity through which he is able to discover the marvelous order that rules over the forces of nature and forge the tools with which to master those same forces and place them at his service."" Thus  true progress must be understood as progress aimed at the moral and material refinement of all men  since it consists not only in the production of larger quantities of material goods but also in the qualitative growth which makes society more equitable and more responsive to the total well-being of its members.That is our great responsibility and  40 years after having accepted it  we have to ask ourselves if we have been equal to such a challenge. Let us then become fully involved in the struggle to offer all peoples of the earth a safer and better future  when we hope all men will be brothers."
"30",1561,"COM",40,1985,"Slightly more than a week ago the Zionist entity committed an act of criminal aggression against Tunisia in blindly bombing a Palestinian camp situated close to the Tunisian capital  causing dozens of casualties among innocent victims.This act of State terrorism  which has added one more to those already perpetrated by Israel against Arab countries  again reveals its true face and very clearly brings out the objectives it has set for itself  assisted by its strategic allies.At a time when the international community is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  this act of aggression  seen as a crime against mankind attests to the contempt felt by the Zionist entity for the sacred principles of peace and justice set forth in the United Nations Charter.My country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  unreservedly condemns this criminal act  and I should like here and now  on behalf of the Government and people of Comoros  to reaffirm our unswerving support and brotherly solidarity with the fraternal peoples of Palestine and Tunisia.*I should like to take this opportunity to state how distressed the Government and people of Comoros were by the tragedy that struck Mexico.I take this opportunity once again to express to the Government and people of that country our heartfelt condolences and to offer them our profound sympathy.It is particularly gratifying to me to convey to Ambassador de Piniés  on behalf of my delegation  our hearty congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session. We are convinced that his diplomatic gifts  experience and familiarity with all issues acquired in his service in important posts both in his country and in the United Nations will be a reliable guarantee of the success of our work.Let me also hail the skill  authority and dedication displayed by his predecessor. Ambassador Paul Lusaka  the representative of a fraternal country  Zambia  in discharging the important responsibilities entrusted to him  thus doing honor not only to his country but also to the whole of Africa.I shall not fail once again to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr.Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless and constant efforts in the service of world peace.This fortieth session of our Organization during which we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of its founding is  for us  a historic event offering us the opportunity to take stock of these four decades of existence and to gage the scope of the role it has been able to play as an international organ created to promote peace  security and co-operation in the world.We are compelled to acknowledge that in the face of the inexorable multiplication of perils the peoples of the world have never felt so keenly the threat which looms daily over them and jeopardizes their very existence. Hence our concern at becoming aware of the growing inability of our Organization to confront the manifold challenges facing mankind  particularly those that represent a direct threat to international peace and security. And hence our awareness of the pressing need to take the measures required by circumstances to ensure respect for and application of the principles of law and justice embodied in our Organization's Charter.If we fail to be vigilant today  tomorrow may be too late. Indeed  how can it be otherwise when might is more powerful than right and violence is substituted for dialog and shared efforts?Millions and millions of people have placed their hopes in this Organization. It embodies the conscience of the world at the same time as it constitutes  despite the obstacles in its way  the last moral threshold which certain Powers at times hesitate to cross.The United Nations is the universal symbol of justice  equality and peace. It is thanks to its action that many peoples and dozens of nations previously laboring under the colonial yoke have today regained freedom and dignity. However  if the community of nations is to continue to discharge its heavy responsibilities effectively  a new state of mind forged of mutual understanding and reciprocal respect must prevail in international relations.Just like the gloomy political situation now prevailing in international relations  the world economic situation is still a matter for concern. Indeed  most of the Members of this Organization  particularly those commonly known as the least developed countries  are suffering acutely from this unfavorable economic situation watching each day the circle of poverty  famine  disease and malnutrition tighten around them.The developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular are defenseless in facing the underlying causes of an economic crisis that is beyond their control. The disastrous effects of this crisis are inflation  reduction in external earnings resulting from a fall in the prices of raw materials  disarray in the international monetary system with a continued rise in interest rates  an increasingly heavy debt burden  the use by developed countries of protectionist measures  and many other elements.The much vaunted recovery has begun a kind of LochNess monster and proves how inadequate are the partial and unilateral solutions taken by the developed countries to deal with structural problems. In our view  only a global and concerted approach encompassing all the realities of this complex situation  in particular taking into account the serious financial difficulties of the developing countries  will be sufficient to extirpate these ills. Indeed  the developing countries are seeing the prices of their commodities falling constantly  and thus their export earnings are reduced at a time when the debt load is becoming increasingly difficult to bear.My country  the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros  one of the least developed countries  is feeling the damaging effects of this crisis particularly painfully. For  as an island country of very limited resources and remote from the major centers of international communications  we are suffering from a continued fall in export earnings  leading to a substantial reduction in purchasing power.This situation has been further compounded for the past two years by poor sales of our major export products. It is  I think  very easy to envisage the consequences of such a situation for an already fragile economy. They have engendered a financial deadlock which impedes our development activities. That means that the efforts undertaken by the Government of the Comoros to improve the economic situation  however praiseworthy they may be  will not in themselves be sufficient to speed up our country's development.The Government of the Comoros for its part  firmly committed to the spirit of free enterprise  appeals to all persons of goodwill to make their contribution to our national reconstruction. Without increased and sustained assistance from the international community  our country will be unable to attain the objectives which it has set itself.To date  the Middle East has been an arena of death and destruction. Far from improving  the situation in that part of the world has worsened as a result of the intransigence of the State of Israel and its contempt for resolutions adopted in this Assembly. The Zionist entity not only refuses to withdraw from the Arab territories which it illegally occupies but persists in increasing the number of Jewish settlements  which quite often bring with them harsh repression of the Arab Palestinian population. In this regard  the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories brings out very clearly the inhuman conditions imposed on the indigenous inhabitants.As we have said time and again  there can be no lasting and just peace in the Middle East until the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are recognized  safeguarded and effectively enjoyed. Thus any negotiations aimed at settling this problem must necessarily involve the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole and authentic legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The situation in Lebanon  marked by daily violence and suffering  has been further exacerbated by the invasion of the Israeli army which  despite the significant losses inflicted on it by the brave people of Lebanon  continues its illegal occupation of a southern part of that country.We take the view that the international community must bring mounting pressure to bear on Israel to compel it to withdraw its troops  in accordance with the terms of Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982)  so that the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon can be assured.After five years of hostility resulting in a situation from which nobody can emerge the victor  the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq continues its ravages on both sides. Despite the efforts of the United Nations and other international organizations  this murderous war has still not ended. In this regard  we welcome the cease-fire proposals of the Iraqi Government with a view to finding a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the crisis and we reiterate our appeal to the two belligerent parties to cease hostilities immediately in keeping with the sacred principles of Islamic solidarity and fraternity.The forces of a foreign Power have not succeeded  after five years of massacres and destruction  in neutralizing the valiant people of Afghanistan. In resisting an enemy whose means and strength are of a different order of magnitude  the people of Afghanistan have proved their determination to fight to the end to recover their independence and dignity. My country  which unreservedly supports the heroic struggle of this fraternal people  demands the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.Kampuchea continues to suffer foreign military occupation despite the resolutions adopted by our General Assembly. We demand the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces so as to enable the people of Kampuchea to return to a life of peace and freedom and to choose their own system of Government.Despite recent overtures made by both parties  the situation on the Korean peninsula continues to be deadlocked. My country will spare no effort to support any initiative aimed at bringing about the peaceful reunification of that country. We urge both parties to persevere in their search for a just and lasting solution to the problem  for a united Korea will be a guarantee of peace and stability in that region. We also believe that the admission of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Korea to this Organization would give added impetus to attempts at finding the solution we seek - the reunification of the country.Southern Africa is still experiencing grave events. The situation is explosive and causes great concern among the international community. In fact  within South Africa bloody repression has been inflicted on the black population while punitive expeditions are launched against neighboring States  in contravention of the elementary rules of international law. The white minority regime persists in denying political and civil rights to the black majority  who  despite the imposition of a state of emergency  continues to wage its heroic struggle to recover its legitimate rights and its dignity.A few days ago Angola suffered another criminal attack perpetrated by the racist regime of Pretoria. While condemning this barbarous act  we wish to reaffirm to the Government and the people of fraternal Angola our unswerving support and militant solidarity.In Namibia  the South African army is persisting in its illegal occupation  despite the relevant resolutions adopted by this Organization. I should like to reiterate our wholehearted support for the struggle of the Namibian people to recover its independence  under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). The Government of Comoros remains convinced that only the full implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) will lead to a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the problem.The situation in Chad calls for particular attention. The latent civil war in this country has for two decades been causing enormous loss of life and material resources in this fraternal country. We wholeheartedly welcome the mediation efforts of President Sassou Nguessou of the Congo to bring about the reconciliation of our Chadian brothers so as to put an end to their suffering and to enable them to undertake their task of national reconstruction.' we encourage him to continue on this course and we urge our Chadian brothers to persevere in this dialog until they can restore harmony and peace.With regard to the Western Sahara  my country reiterates its entire and continuing support for the resolutions adopted at the eighteenth and nineteenth summit meetings of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and remains convinced that a satisfactory and lasting solution to this grave problem necessarily involves the holding of a referendum on self-determination in the country. In this respect  we urge all parties concerned to use all peaceful means at their disposal and to show good will and wisdom in order to reach this goal.Like all the other States of the region  my country is concerned at the growing strength of the military presence in the Indian Ocean. Such a situation  exacerbated by great-Power rivalry  creates a climate of explosive tension causing apprehension to the coastal States.Desirous of preserving peace and security in that region  my country has spared no effort to promote the creation of a zone of peace  demilitarized and denuclearized  in the Indian Ocean  in accordance with the Declaration in resolution 2832 (XXVI) of our Organization. We continue to hope that we shall at last see the international conference planned for that purpose in Sri Lanka.Before I conclude this rapid review of the international situation  allow me once again to speak on a question that is very familiar to our Assembly  but a subject of major concern to my country. I refer to the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte. This problem  the result of an injustice and a flagrant violation of international public law  is permanently on the agenda of all international and regional organizations. Once again this year it will be the subject of a specific debate  which will enable us to address it in more detail. For the time being  I would merely recall that on every occasion this question has been debated in the international community there has always been unanimity in condemning the injustice and use of force and affirming that Mayotte is an integral part of the Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros. As such  it must be restored to the Comorian entity.Hence I reaffirm in this forum that the Comorian Government and people  drawing upon the strength of the rightness of their cause and the unanimous support of the international community  are resolved to struggle until their just cause triumphs. However  we remain open to dialog and consultation in order to bring about a speedy and just solution to this problem  in keeping with the recommendations of the relevant resolutions of this Assembly.Once again therefore we make a pressing appeal to the French Government .that within the framework of the friendly relations existing between our two countries  to take definite steps towards the settlement of this problem.In concluding my remarks  I express the ardent hope that this Organization will be able to fulfill its primary mission: of promoting peace and fostering co-operation among the nations and peoples of this world.On this historic occasion  as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  I would like to reaffirm solemnly my country's deep-rooted adherence to the ideals of peace  freedom and justice enshrined in our Charter."
"31",1645,"CRI",40,1985,"It is with particular pleasure that my delegation joins in the congratulations expressed to the Permanent Representative of Spain  Ambassador Don Jaime de Pinies - an outstanding diplomat and well-known within United Nations circles for his important contributions to the work of the united Nations - upon his election by acclamation as President of this session of the General Assembly  at which we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.Similarly  I wish to express my delegation's thanks to his illustrious predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  the Permanent Representative of Zambia  for the successful way in which he led the work of the General Assembly during its thirty-ninth session.The Government of Costa Rica wishes to express its warm appreciation for its election to the post of Vice-President of the General Assembly. This further commits my country to increase its efforts to co-operate in the arduous tasks before this Assembly.Our people and Government are deeply moved by the tragedy which has befallen our brothers in Mexico. That is why we noted with great pleasure the speed and the sense of solidarity with which the Assembly considered the problem and instructed the SecretaryGeneral to co-ordinate multilateral aid in consultation with the Mexican Government.We stand on the threshold of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. In a month the United Nations will have been active for four decades. This anniversary therefore  gives Member States a unique opportunity to make a far-reaching and sincere self-appraisal. It is a fitting moment to look backwards  to examine the purposes announced at the foundation of the Organization and to see to what extent an effort has been made to sake them a reality  to what extent the United Nations has lived up to the hopes placed in it when it began its work in that hopeful autumn of 1945. It is time to take stock  and to reflect on the Organization which its founders had in mind  that which we have now  and that which we wish to see in the future.Forty year ago  Don Julio Acosta  the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Costa Rica  signed the document which led to the birth of this Organization. Like the other founding nations  Costa Rica set great store by the united Nations as the keystone to a new international order in a world community which would be an effective guarantor of peace and co-existence among all the peoples of the world. We believed that the traumatic experience of the Second world War had been enough to make everybody aware that it was essential for the survival of mankind that there should be an international organization which would work effectively for peace  a brotherhood of States which would manage t.o overcome differences between peoples and which would not relapse into the painful ineffectiveness and frustrating irrelevance of the League of Nations.Unfortunately  we are faced today with a harsh reality. It is true that it has been possible to avoid the bloody specter of a world conflagration  but one may wonder whether this is due to a feeling of fraternity  or whether it is simply the balance of terror which has prevented this final holocaust from occurring. whatever the answer to that question  we must acknowledge that it is not peace which has prevailed in the world over the last 40 years. How many conflicts  crises and disputes have afflicted mankind since 1945? How much blood has been shed? Hew many men and women have died as a result of violence? How many have suffered imprisonment  torture  exile and oppression?What is perhaps most tragic about such self-appraisal is the discovery that to none of these questions can one yet give a final answer  since the figures continue to rise day by day.A good example of this is to be found in the agenda of the Assembly. When an international problem becomes an agenda item it almost certainly will remain on that agenda year after year. Thousands of words will be uttered and it will become the subject of a mass of documents  but it is very unlikely to be satisfactorily disposed of. This is not because that is what the Organization wants or because no attempt has been made to solve those problems. The responsibility for this rests with the Member states which depart from the spirit of San Francisco whenever they feel it is in their interest to do so. It is this attitude that undermines the foundations of the United Nations and has on many occasions made the Charter a dead letter.Nevertheless  it is only realistic to acknowledge that major progress has been made in some areas. There is no doubt that many of the specialized agencies have done an excellent job and have achieved unprecedented results which the States themselves  working alone  would not have been able to achieve. In this respect we believe that the co-operation provided by the United Nations has been of vital importance and constitutes a legitimate source of pride for this Organization.We have read with great interest the Secretary-General's annual report on the activities of the Organization. With his customary care  he has referred to the international situation  providing a realistic and forthright account of the grave problems besetting the international community and the measures that should be adopted to resolve them. My delegation pays a tribute to and thanks the Secretary-General for the concern he shows and for his dedication to the ideals of the united Nations.In the light of all this  it is essential to return to our original source  the spirit of 1945. We must make a vigorous effort to give effect to the ideals which governed the birth of this Organization. Let there be no more mistrust  no more thirst for power  no more use of violence and economic and political pressure to protect nefarious interests. Let this Organization gradually cease to be a forum for talking about problems and become an effective instrument for negotiation and harmony between nations  a setting for vigorous co-operation and the exchange of knowledge  where the word ""war"" becomes a memory of the past.If the purposes of the united Nations are to be fully achieved it must become truly universal. This is the roost comprehensive organization ever created by human societies  but it must attain a further dimension. No people on earth should lack a voice in this chamber. There are no valid reasons for closing the doors of the United Nations on any State which is ready to accept its guiding principles. If the lessons of history show anything it is that ignoring the existence of a conflict is not the best way of resolving it. The case of the two Koreas is a good example of how today there are still outside this Organization nations whose presence is necessary if the United Nations is to represent or attempt to represent  all human activities. Universality is a necessity for this Organization  but it is still far from being achieved.We note with enormous satisfaction the first agreements reached between the two Koreas  in which we should like to see signs of fuller understanding between the two parts of a single people.The same ideal of universal membership should govern the efforts to find answers to the serious difficulties afflicting mankind. Political instability  economic ills and social unrest are all widespread diseases of the world today. Among all the painful problems mentioned in the Secretary-General's report  whichhe refers to quite rightly as social and political poisons  I consider it necessary to refer to two which affect us in a special way and to which no State is immune.There is an urgent need to make a radical attack on the problem of terrorism. This phenomenon  which clashes with the principles on which the united Nations is based is becoming alarmingly widespread. All States  rich and poor  are today present or potential victims of this irrational scourge. The recent kidnapping of the daughter of the President of El Salvador  Mr. Jose Napoleon Duarte  constitutes another dramatic link in this bitter chain of barbarism.We know that very frequently an attempt is made to justify the perpetration of acts of terrorism by reference to political and social considerations. To my country this attitude is evidence of backwardness and obscurantism. The use of terror as an instrument of political action cannot be justified and must give rise to feelings of contempt and condemnation.Terrorism is an international phenomenon. It is a delusion to imagine that any country can escape its impact. It is also a mistake to think that its presence in a State is an internal problem which the international community can ignore. An act of terrorism is a crime against mankind which wounds all countries equally. Hence  Costa Rica considers it of fundamental importance to take strong measures to eliminate this ulcer  which has grown to alarming proportions. Furthermore  this concern increases when we note that  although all States verbally condemn this repulsive phenomenon  some of them not only fail to fulfill international conventions aimed at its elimination but use terror as an instrument.The refugee problem is of even more devastating and awesome proportions. Its persistence and growth confirms the belief that in many parts of the world the words of the United Nations Charter are still only words. Once again we see that the principles of 1945 have not become a reality. We continue to see dramatic increases in the numbers of men  women and children compelled to flee from theirplaces of origin to escape the horrors of war  political persecution  poverty and oppression  and the dramatic impact this has on the host nations  which do not always have the economic and social capacity to absorb the displaced persons and offer them the prospect of the decent life to which they are entitled as human beings.Millions of people form part of this problem of our sorely tried world. In recent years its shadow has extended to my own country and has compelled us to face up to a reality of which we had previously not had experience. The number of displaced persons and refugees currently sheltered by Costa Rica may well seem derisive when compared to world figures. There are 200 000 refugees in Costa Rica  the majority being of Nicaraguan origin. However  given the size of our country  this represents an overwhelming figure - approximately 10 per cent of the total population of our country - and Costa Rica is an underdeveloped country with very weak economic potential. The complications attendant upon their presence in Costa Rica represent a difficult burden-for our country. We do not close our doors to them  we seek to assist them as much as we can  but we think it vital that the international community provide more effective assistance for the programs developed by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. The commendable efforts it makes to assist refugee populations with their resettlement or possible return should be vigorously encouraged by the United Nations. The proposal to strengthen the activities of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should  we believe  be considered a matter of priority. Some problems which geographically would be considered merely regional in nature are in fact so great in their impact that they join that terrible list of tragedies which faces the world today. Their scale transforms them into problems common to all mankind  and their solution must be achieved through a common effort by all mankind. They are problems whose existence is  to our regret  solid proof that the international community does not yet have effective means to eliminate hunger and poverty and to offer people a better future - problems which inevitably bring us face to face with the yawning gaps that still separate the developed and the developing world  with the shameful coexistence of abundance and malnutrition  of high technology and primitive ignorance  of the wealth enjoyed by the few and the dramatic scarcity and crushing financial burdens suffered by others.I am specifically referring to the problem of hunger in Africa and the problem of Latin America's external debt. The critical food situation in Africa is a drama the terrible consequences of which affect millions of human beings today. It is a drama the scale of which is too great and too painful. It is a drama which is without precedent  and whose solution requires an unprecedented effort.It is shameful that while we are talking in this Hall  so many human beings are dying of hunger. It is true that the international community has given its attention to this problem  but it is equally true that it is capable of showing more effective and energetic solidarity. It is of vital importance that more resources and greater efforts be devoted to resolving this problem and that steps be taken to ensure that such a phenomenon never occurs again.Africa requires major international assistance to deal with serious problems of health  water supplies and housing and elementary agricultural requirements. It is painful to note that Africa's Governments must devote to the servicing of their external debt resources which are urgently needed for the development of their peoples.Consideration of the problems of external debt lead us once again to wonder whether the new global order that the founders hoped for in 1945 has actually been achieved. This particularly applies in the case of Latin Americans  since at that time there was a general feeling that Latin America would be the region to progress most rapidly towards the attainment of economic and social progress.Unfortunately  that expectation has not been fulfilled. Forty years later  Latin America is the region with the most serious economic problems. Latin America is beset with an unprecedented financial and economic crisis  the origin of which we are all familiar with. The contraction of international trade  protectionism in the industrialized countries and volatile high interest rates are magnifying this problem and turning into obstacles to the recovery process embarked on by the Latin American governments.We therefore consider that responsibility for the problem of our indebtedness cannot be considered in simple terms  such as that it is solely our responsibility and it is up to us to resolve it. All of those here know full well that this crisis has various causes and the debtors are only partly responsible. We are debtors not because we wish to be so  but because an unjust international economic order has compelled us to become such. We have not denied our responsibility  but we wish to make it clear that the solution to such a major problem also lies with the industrialized countries  the lending banks and international financial institutions.Costa Rica acknowledges its debt. It is attempting to meet it despite the harsh terms set  but it needs reasonable terms of payment  in consonance with its economic situation  so that it can consolidate its political  economic and social democracy.Costa Rica devotes a high percentage of its resources to the improvement and development of its education and health systems and its physical infrastructure. Its disarmament policy makes this possible. However  in recent years it has had to earmark some 50 per cent of its income  deriving from exports  to external debt servicing. We do not spend money on weapons  nor are we able to spend these funds cm development.Costa Rica considers that the scale of the problem of Latin American debt is such that it cannot be ignored by this Organization  we therefore call on the United Nations to give political and economic consideration to the search for comprehensive and practical solutions  as well as to finding new methods for negotiations which would involve all parties which in one way or another are responsible for this crisis.Only thus can we find the right path towards solving this urgent matter.The overwhelming external debt is not  however  the only problem filling the peoples of Latin America with dismay. Situations of injustice  aggression and violence continue to leave a scar on the lives of thousands of Latin Americans. At this time  the most cruel and visible face of this reality is the crisis which for years now has been besetting Central America  an area sorely tried by history and whose traditional problems  in themselves overwhelming  have now been compounded. Despite the wishes and interests of its inhabitants  Central America has become a further arena for East-West confrontation  an outlet for the conflict between extra-regional Powers.Since 1983  we in Central America have seen ourselves involved in an ambitious and innovative negotiating process under the commendable auspices of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela. The Contadora initiative  inspired by the fundamental goal of finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in Central America  has been directed at finding a solution to our problems. The Contadora process has given rise to great expectations and the reaction to it by the international community could hardly have been more encouraging.It has become common place in international forums to issue very positive views of the Contadora initiative. To commend its spirit and to express repeated support for the Contadora mediation process is regarded as the right thing to do. This magnificent support for Contadora by the international community is a source of pleasure  because we also believe  as we have stated on many occasions  that it constitutes the most viable option for the peaceful and global solution to the problems of Central America.Costa Rica continues to believe that this view is the correct one. But my country considers that the time has come for us to see the fruits of this process  to see real solutions rather than words. Otherwise  Contadora runs the risk of becoming an end in itself and an endless round of negotiations resolving nothing.The loss of credibility of this Latin American initiative would have tragic and disastrous consequences. It would provide further arguments for those who believe that the sword and the rifle are the only means for resolving Central America's problems.In this connection  we were highly satisfied and encouraged at the significant progress achieved in the last meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Central America and the Contadora countries which took place in Panama on 12 and 13 September. Today we have before us a new version of the draft Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. We have good reasons to believe that today we can state here that we find ourselves at a time of hope and that there are prospects of a practical solution in the relatively near future.For the peace and prosperity of Central America  we very much hope that this is the case  and we therefore vehemently urge all the parties and all the countries that in one way or.another are present  as it were  in the Central American crisis to demonstrate with facts their determination to provide a concrete solution to the problem in our region. Let real steps be taken to subscribe to and ratify this vital document; let there be the political will that is so indispensable if this major peace effort is to become a binding legal commitment.Costa Rica hopes that through the machinery to be established pursuant to the Contadora Act  it will be possible to solve the sole problem that leads us to consider ourselves to be part of the Central American crisis: the border aggressions committed against us by the Government of Nicaragua. During recent years Costa Rica and its Government have been the victims of constant  permanent aggression  the manifestations of which have ranged from the open  evil attack  on 31 May last  by a patrol of civil guards carrying out surveillance activities on a part of the border to the veiled threats from high military and political authorities in Nicaragua.If the Contadora Act is to become an instrument enabling the Central American peoples to fulfill their legitimate aspirations to peace  democracy  justice and development  vigorous and effective-solidarity must be shown by the international community; this solidarity must reflect the countless expressions of support for the Contadora Group.Real evidence of something which all countries state they desire and support would be an arms limitation. It is time that this condemnation of the arms race  expressed so many times in the General Assembly and many other international forums  took the form of concrete steps - and not only carefully worded speeches and impeccable resolutions. Too much has been said and very little has actually been done. Suffice it to recall that at the very first session of the General Assembly  in January 1946  a resolution was adopted stating that the objective was the elimination of atomic weapons and all other major weapons of mass destruction. It is shameful to admit that every day we get farther and farther away from that objective  which might well be said to have seen the light of day in this Organization.Everyone is aware of the importance to mankind of reaching substantial agreements on disarmament  and of the vital necessity for disarmament to become a reality. Costa Rica  a neutral country without an army  has constantly supported the initiatives taken by this organization in the field of disarmament and it will continue to give its support to any steps taken along new lines on this delicate matter.Over these 40 years we have noted with concern the relations between the two Super-Powers  They have moved from tension to confrontation  and from confrontation back to situations of tension. Nevertheless  today there are some elements which allow for optimism. Talks on disarmament are being held  and soon there will be a meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. The possibility of reducing tensions - something that is always desirable - seems today to enjoy better prospects than has been the case for some time.On the initiative of Costa Rica  with the unanimous support of the Members of the General Assembly  1986 will be declared the ""International Year of Peace"". This fact  which reflects the commitment to peace that is mankind's greatest desire  should become a moral and ethical force operating world-wide to direct the conscience of the leaders of the world  East and West  North and south  towards this transcendental goal  which sums up the very raison d'etre of the United Nations. In due course my delegation will circulate a draft resolution in this respect  which will be the text of the proclamation  on 24 October 1985  of the ""International Year of Peace"". We cordially call on all delegations to co-sponsor this draft resolution.Lastly  we appeal to all the States Members of the Organization to ensure that the united Nations can play the leading role which it should play in solving the major problems afflicting mankind. If that is not done  all of us - to our great regret - will be directly responsible for the final holocaust."
"32",1691,"CSK",40,1985,"I congratulate Mr. de Pinies  a prominent diplomatic representative of a country with which we are developing mutually beneficial co-operation  on his election to the office of President of the fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish him and also the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  every success in their responsible tasks.I wish also to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Zambia  a country to which we are tied by bonds of friendship  for his strenuous efforts in the past year.I should like to offer our profound condolences to the people and Government of Mexico in connection with the recent natural disaster that has caused that friendly country such painful losses.As we solemnly commemorate the 40 years of existence of our Organization  I appear before its supreme body  the General Assembly  with a special feeling of responsibility to emphasize as strongly as I can that today international relations are simply inconceivable without the United Nations. Born in the fire of the struggle of nations to save civilization from fascism  a struggle in which States with different social systems were united  the United Nations has engraved on its shild the noble words of the Charter which have become a symbol of its era: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".It was this fundamental idea that a Czechoslovak representative took up when he stated at the time of the Organization's birth:""Whoever speaks of the inevitability of the next war is out of order and going beyond the bounds of the realistic and idealistic realms of our adventure  the greatest ever undertaken by mere mortals. It is called United Nations"".He are proud that Czechoslovakia  a true ally of the great alliance and of the Soviet Union which played a decisive part in the defeat of Nazism  contributed its pis re to the great victory.Our people  one of the first victims of Hitler ism  rose in arms against it both at home and abroad. Our troops fought on the side of the Allies at Kharkov  Kiev and in the Carpathian mountains  defended Paris and London  African Tobruk and Benghazi and took part in the invasion of Normandy. The name of the Czech village of Lidice is still mentioned in the same breath with Coventry and Oradour. It was Prague  the capital of our country  where the fighting on the European continent came to an end on the last day of that horrible war. As we were hastening to participate enthusiastically in the historic moment of the founding of our Organization  the Soviet Army was still waging on our territory a fierce struggle against the occupying forces. During the six dark years from the black days of Munich to 9 May 1945  hundreds of thousands of human beings from our country were sacrificed on the altar of the common victory.Ever since that time  guided by its unwavering desire to cooperate unswervingly within the ranks of the United Nations and true to the objectives of its Charter  we have always accorded top priority to the supreme task of averting war  safeguarding peace  strengthening international security  achieving disarmament and developing co-operation in all fields. We have always been sincerely pleased by all its successes and have never been indifferent to its failures.And so  for the first time in the history of mankind  we have a universal world Organization. As the Secretary-General states in this year's report on the work of the Organization ""it is the best place to avoid the worst and to strive for improvement"". (A/40/1  p. 3)To that end the Organization has done good work  perhaps far better than we realize. It therefore deserves our recognition. How it should use all its great experience to become even more effective  to enhance its activities in the political and security-building spheres  to deepen and broaden co-operation in the economic  social  legal; cultural and humanitarian fields and to become more flexible  using all the existing potential and doing away with elements of formalism  so as to achieve a general strengthening of its position and role in international relations. The declaration adopted at the solemn meeting of the Security Council is a worthy promise thereof and at the same time a challenge to us all.In the promotion of peace  international security and the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems Europe plays an irreplaceable role. It was there that in this century two atrocious world wars broke out. Yet it was there also that the policy of detente  which has taken such deep roots in the consciousness of the people  came into being. This was demonstrated especially at the recent meeting held on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Helsinki Conference. That meeting confirmed the vitality of the principles of the Final Act. It proved that European countries unquestionably prefer revitalizing detente to paralyzing it and they have rejected the practices of confrontation. Attempts to impose such practices have ended in clear failure.For our part  we intend to continue to contribute to the broadening of political dialog among States with different social systems. The dynamism of our bilateral contacts with European countries is a most striking example of this.Having drawn a lesson from the troubles of the adolescence of the policy of detente  all participating States should redouble their efforts to extend it into the military sphere. This will not be an easy task. It has had to surmount many obstacles on its road so far and there are many pot-holes and ditches still awaiting it.However  in the post-Hiroshima era  we cannot afford to wait and see what happens or what might happen. The situation requires resolution based on mature political will. Political leaders are duty-bound to make decisions that the peoples of Europe deserve to show ability worthy of historic statesmanlike judgment.As the deliberations of the Stockholm Conference continue  indications of the possibility that its conclusion may be successful grow stronger. We consider that it has now readied the stage of clarifying the broad framework that would make it possible to proceed soon to substantive negotiations about a concluding document. We advocate the formulation of significant and effective military-political and military-technical confidence- and security-building measures  including a treaty on the renunciation of the use of military force in relations among States  a treaty that is already beginning to take shape. In this spirit  together with ourallies  we have submitted a number of working papers with specifically drafted proposals. We hope they will meet with the reception they deserve.The results of the Helsinki meeting are encouraging. We hope that other meetings within the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe - the cultural forum in Budapest  the seminar on contacts between people in Bern  and particularly the next follow-up meeting to be held in Vienna in the autumn of 1986 - will have a similarly constructive spirit.Positive movement could also be achieved in the talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. What is required here is responsible consideration by the Western participants of the far-reaching compromise proposals of the Socialist countries. In Vienna  too  it is necessary to remain within the realm of reason and to give up any attempts at demonizing the other side. In April  when we extended the validity of the Warsaw Treaty  we reaffirmed our readiness to dissolve that alliance if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bloc were willing to do the same - and that still holds good today.We welcome the mutual movement in the dialog between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMSA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) that has been noted recently. We expect it to play the role of a constructive catalyst in developing equal and mutually advantageous economic co-operation between the two largest European integrated groupings  in the spirit of the Final Act.Although it is said that some signs of a thaw have lately begun to appear in the international situation  the political horizon still remains covered with clouds and tensions abound. The blame lies with the imperialist circles. Driven by a vision of military superiority  they have been escalating the arms race  trying to add to it a space dimension. The implementation of such plans would considerably increase the danger of nuclear war. Further immense resources  badly needed to solve the urgent tasks of the economic and social development of all States  primarily the developing countries  would be cast into the abyss of the arms race. If it were really meant seriously that ""a new nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought""  then the attitude of those who are responsible for it would have to be different. In this situation  the primary task  as we see it  is for all Member states to unite their efforts to avert war. This requires  first of all  unconditionally preventing the extension of the arms race into outer space  halting it on earth and limiting and reducing nuclear armaments until their complete elimination.Czechoslovakia is the third country  after the Soviet Union and the United States  from which a citizen has entered outer space. It is actively participating in peaceful space programs and fully supports the idea of ""star.peace"" as opposed to the threat of ""star wars"".Let mankind proceed to grandiose projects industrializing the space around Earth. Let mankind create new materials and products in conditions of weightlessness. The implementation of such plans worthy of the pioneering spirit  of mankind is  however  possible only in conditions of non-militarization of outer space. Space technology must be placed exclusively at the service of all  the entire human race. It must not be monopolized as a destructive force  as happened in the mid-1940s with nuclear energy.The evil intention to militarize outer space threatens to have immeasurable consequences. Today it is the greatest danger to peace. This is how the overwhelming majority of mankind feels  as demonstrated by the statements of so many speakers from this rostrum.Nevertheless  some politicians try to convince the public that this is merely a new stage of research that  supposedly  would naturally lead to the reduction of nuclear armaments and eventually eliminate nuclear war from society. To say something like that is to be completely out of touch with reality. If the project of the so-called strategic defense initiative is a detonator for an even more dangerous stage of the arms race  then what is called its scientific-research phase must be viewed in the same way. what is involved are the first components of a project for space weapons designed to allow for a first nuclear strike that would go unpunished. The argument that this peace-destabilizing concept strengthens strategic stability simply cannot be maintained.The introduction of any sophisticated technology into the military sphere cannot benefit the security of one side if it poses a threat to others. There is only one criterion: mutual security or mutual insecurity - for all.And so we attach all the greater importance to the Soviet-United States talks on space and nuclear weapons in Geneva. They would definitely be favorably affected by the adoption of the Soviet proposals to institute for the duration of the talks a moratorium on the development - including scientific research work -testing and deployment of offensive space weapons  to freeze strategic offensive weapons of both sides  to halt the deployment of united States intermediate-range missiles in Europe and the expansion of respective counter-measures. Finally it would be most beneficial for the talks if the United States were to join in the Soviet moratorium on all nuclear explosions declared byMikhail Sergeivich Gorbachev. It is a truly reasonable initiative  simple enough to be understood by everybody. So what is wrong with it? It just paves the way for a total ban on nuclear tests and thus for the stopping the modernization of nuclear weaponry. It is a good example for other States that possess nuclear weapons.Regrettably  however  the response of the other side is negative. It reveals an absolute lack of good political will  reflecting an attempt to conceal the direct relationship between nuclear tests and the program to militarize outer space.So what is there to say? The main point is that once and for all one must abandon the fatal illusion that the development and production of destructive arms systems would force the socialist countries to give up on not allowing the existing approximate strategic balance to be upset.Czechoslovakia advocates a ban on all kinds of weapons designed for use against objects in outer space and from space against the earth. It calls for the elimination of space from the sphere of the arms race  and that this become an inviolable norm of the policy of all States and a generally recognized international obligation. We therefore regard as innovative and most timely the. proposal by the Soviet Union on international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space under conditions of its non-militarization  an item that has been included on our agenda. We support its idea that the General Assembly should convene  by 1987 at latest  an international conference to be attended by States with significant space potential and other interested countries  that could agree upon the basic directions and principles of peaceful co-operation in space. Equally constructive is the suggestion that the conference should consider the question of establishing a world space organization for the activities of States in peaceful space activities. Implementation of those projects would undoubtedly give man the feeling that he needs so much  that he has firm ground under his feet.We cherish the hope that in spite of all obstacles the forthcoming Soviet-United States summit level talks will make it possible to look to the future  not only of those two large countries  but of all mankind. Certainly much can be remedied if both sides are ready to compromise  but that means discussing  not the myths and stereotypes of which everyone has grown weary  it means focusing on the true problems of the world community and considering them on the basis of equality  true equality. After all  neither of the two sides has ever lost to the other in a war  or even a battle  and moreover they owe each other absolutely nothing. We welcome the significant talks of Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in Washington  being convinced that Geneva in November will fulfill what is expected of it.It is our view that achieving the desired goal - a world free from nuclear weapons - requires a speedy formulation and adoption of a program of nuclear disarmament. Nostalgic yearning for global hegemony does not correspond in today's world with the laws  of nuclear physics. And so such a program should encompass moral and political  as well as legal but  above all  practical and far-reaching material measures based on the principles of reciprocity  equality and equal security. It would offer a historic opportunity to set up a basis for a peaceful entry into the twenty-first century  and with a completely different nuclear strategy and with a significant reduction of the risk that civilization may burn down in the fire of a nuclear apocalypse.Of course  no agreement has any chance of success if a mutual deep understanding of the catastrophic nature of a nuclear conflict does not develop and if a political will and mutual restraint do not change false illusions or unrealistically calculated intentions. That is where the rational core of a new thinking in the nuclear age lies.We consistently support also the proposal that all nuclear Powers pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. We advocate both a quantitative and qualitative freeze on nuclear weapons and we value the joint declaration of the Heads of State and Government of Argentina  India  Mexico  Greece  Sweden and Tanzania adopted in January this year in New Delhi  which emphasizes the extraordinarily strong topicality of those issues today.We attach great importance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a significant factor strengthening international security. We identify ourselves with the results of the third Review Conference. They have confirmed that that document is one of the fundamental pillars of the international legal system. It is a major obstacle to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and  at the same time  it is an instrument that does provide sufficient opportunity for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We believe the Treaty should be made fully universal so that it becomes even more effective.An integral part of the non-proliferation regime is that existing nuclear-weapon-free zones be respected and new ones created. We support the proposal for a nuclear-free corridor in Central Europe  which directly involves Czechoslovakia. We also support such zones in the northern part of our continent and in the Balkans. We are ready to support any constructive proposals on this question that relate to other parts of the world also.We also advocate the speedy convening of a conference to discuss the question of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.As to another dangerous kind of weapon of mass destruction  chemical arms  we advocate a world-wide ban. Regrettably  practical progress on this question at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has been blocked by the obstructionist attitude of certain well-known circles. Moreover  the United States decision to resume production of binary chemical ammunition destined mainly for Western Europe makes this situation even more difficult. In the circumstances  we consider it necessary to take parallel steps at the regional level  particularly in Europe. The Governments of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the German Democratic Republic proposed therefore to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that we conclude an agreement on establishing a chemical-weapon-free zone that at the initial stage would include the territories of those three States. We are glad to hear from the statement made here by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that it is studying our proposal  and we hope that it will take a favorable view of it. For our part  we are ready to open the respective negotiations as soon as possible.We support measures to prevent any increase in military expenditures  and indeed reduce them  so that the resources made available can be spent on social and economic development  particularly in the developing countries.We continue to attach great importance to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva as the only multilateral disarmament forum of a global nature. We welcome the progress that was made there at this year's session  as demonstrated  for example  by the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on Outer Space. Regrettably  some Western States have been trying to transform the Conference gradually from an organ of negotiation into a mere debating club. They have been blocking the establishment of working groups on issues of priority importance  and obstructing progress on questions under consideration. We are convinced that this fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly should give States participating in the Conference a strong impetus to mobilize their political will and lead the Geneva negotiations out of its long-lasting stagnation.As far as hotbeds of tension are concerned  I should like to mention first of all the situation in Central America  where overt imperialism has been escalating its aggressive action  including military actions  against the sovereign Republic of Nicaragua  against the national liberation movement in El Salvador  and against other countries. We respect the constructive position taken by the Nicaraguan Government. We value the activity of the Contadora Group and also the support given to it by other Latin American countries.We would insistently urge the Security Council to adopt effective sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa. The new waves of terror perpetrated by the racists against the majority  the African population  reveal that the so-called reforms carried out by the Pretoria regime do not change by one whit the disgraceful and shameful nature of apartheid. The situation does not allow of any delay. Apartheid must be swept away from the face of Africa as soon as possible. We resolutely advocate the immediate granting of independence to the people of Namibia on the basis of the implementation of the relevant decisions of the UnitedNations  including the resolutions of the Security Council. The latest aggression by South Africa against the sovereign People's Republic of Angola  has just confirmed once again that there can be no peace in that region as long as the apartheid regime exists. We condemn that aggression as a ruthless manifestation of the policy of State terrorism. We express our full support for the courageous struggle waged by the people of Angola in defending the independence of their homeland.In the Middle East current developments once again show clearly that the policy of separate steps on the Camp David model cannot lead to a just solution. Such a policy is possible only at the cost of the interests and national rights of not only the Palestinian people but all Arab nations. A way out of the present situation caused by Israeli aggression is offered in the unified course of action proposed by the Arab States and adopted by them at the summit conference in Fez. The principles agreed on there could be put into practice through the convening of an international conference on the Middle East  as proposed by the Soviet Union. Naturally  a condition for this would be the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and recognition of their right to establish their own independent State. We would also express our full support for the efforts to restore the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.We strongly condemn the most recent aggressive act of Israel whose victim at this time was Tunisia. Unfortunately  the aggressor is still enjoying the cynical support of allies in the strategic alliance it belongs to.We advocate a swift halt to the Iraq-Iran conflict. If there is good political will  the disputed questions can be settled by peaceful negotiation.That would be in harmony with the interests of the people of both countries and also the people of the whole region. He resolutely condemn the attempts by imperialism to misuse that conflict in order to increase its military presence in the Gulf and the Indian Ocean.It is our firm view that the normalization of the situation around Afghanistan is possible only if the right of its people to independent development is fully respected and if an end is put to armed as well as other interference in the internal affairs of that country. We regard as useful the process of negotiations between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and Pakistan through the intermediary of the representative of the Secretary-General. It would be beneficial if the negotiations proceeded to the stage of direct talks.As to the situation in South-East Asia  we support the proposals of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea aimed at transforming South-East Asia into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation. We consider that the only effective way of settling the problems of the region lies through political dialog  especially between the IndoChinese States and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). We regard as an absolutely just step  corresponding to reality  that the people's Republic of Kampuchea be represented in the United Nations.We reaffirm our full support for the efforts of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea for peaceful reunification of Korea on democratic principles  without external interference. We also support its demands for the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea and the transformation of the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free-weapon zone. A good basis for the settlement of the Korean question would be the resolution adopted at the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly on the initiative of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea.We are convinced that the strengthening of stability in the world would be substantially promoted by implementing a number of well-known initiatives to transform the whole of Asia into a zone of peace and security. This requires the endeavors of all Asian States  regardless their social system  up to the possible establishment of an all-Asian forum to consider the entire complex of issues involving the safeguarding of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborly relations on that continent  something along the lines of what happened in Europe at the Helsinki Conference.We fully support a peaceful and equitable settlement of the question of Cyprus. That would mean that Cyprus could remain an independent  sovereign  territorially integral  united and non-aligned State  free from all foreign interference and military presence.It is a sad reality that today  40 years after the founding of the United Nations and 25 years after the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the peoples of a large number of Territories are still denied their fundamental and inalienable right to freedom and independence. That is why we have advocated  repeatedly and emphatically  an immediate eradication of all remnants of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations  including neo-colonialism.Our Organization has been participating to a significant extent in the solution of international economic and social problems. It has gradually established organs  organizations and specialized agencies that co-ordinate economic  trade  scientific and technical co-operation. It has also provided a framework for the adoption of important multilateral instruments regulating that co-operation.Unfortunately  the principles embodied therein have been constantly violated. Together with many developing countries we have for a number of years been pointing out the need to safeguard economic security. We condemn trade embargoes  discriminatory measures  sanctions or the conditioning of economic and humanitarian assistance on political concessions.The relations between the indebted developing countries and their creditors cannot be narrowed down to the rather primitive bookkeeping formula of ""debits"" and ""credits"". After all  they are the result of the centuries-old process of the exploitation of African  Asian and Latin American countries by colonialism and neo-colonialism  and  also  they are the result of unprecedented manipulation of the terms of credit redemption. Let us remember that in the Middle Ages in Europe  usurers were punished for practicing usury or machinations with credit and ruthless fleecing of debtors by severe penalties  including burning at the stake and impalement.We advocate complete normalization of the credit policies. We fully support the proposal presented here by the Prime Minister of the Polish People's Republic  Wojciech Jaruzelski  that  under the aegis of the Secretary-General  an international debt and development research centre be established.We have been constantly striving for a restructuring of international economic relations based on just and democratic foundations and creating conditions for equal co-operation. Reaffirming it  we proposed a programme of action designed to remedy the wrongs done in those relations. It was put forward at the summit meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. It is an open offer to all countries.We are pleased that the proposals emanating from the recent Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries in Luanda are oriented in the same direction. That broad peace-loving group has been playing an ever more important and  indeed  irreplaceable role in the present difficult situation in the world today. We value its work in the struggle against the danger of nuclear catastrophe  its struggle for a peaceful outer space  disarmament  development of broad mutually advantageousinternational co-operation  peaceful settlement of conflicts  and the elimination of the hotbeds of tension throughout the world.If we are to talk about human rights  then we must say that that is an ideal as old as the human race itself. If they are to be valid in all parts of the world  throughout the globe  why are just some selected countries branded with the mark of Cain as alleged offenders while an ideal of democratic perfection is attributed to others  as political needs dictate?Therefore I ask: are those who are so eager to point their finger at others free of sin themselves? Have they embodied in their constitutions the right to work for all their fellow human beings? Do they grant them the right to free education? To free medical care? To a time of rest from work? To pensions? Have they ratified the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights or on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights? Are they not  in their search for wrong answers to right questions  seeing a speck of dust in someone else's eye while failing to see the beam in their own eyes  as the biblical saying goes? It must be repeated again and again that human rights are always a concrete combination of civil and political rights with fundamental economic and social rights and that each country has its own concept of them. This fact must be taken into consideration. Otherwise we shall continue to be trapped in the vicious circle of irrationality.I can assure the General Assembly that Czechoslovakia  committed to the lofty mission of our Organization  will continue to pursue its noble goals. As the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Gustav Husak  said ""He shall continue to struggle to avert the threat of war  to achieve disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  to achieve the peaceful settlement of international problems on the basis of the principles of equality and equal security and to bring international relations back to the path of detente and constructive co-operation""."
"33",1714,"CUB",40,1985,"Forty years ago  on the ruins of Nazi fascism and of the infamous and ignominious ""New Order"" that Hitler's hordes tried to impose on mankind  the peoples of the United Nations founded this Organization ""determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  to reaffirm their faith in the undying values of man and mankind and in the equal rights of nations large and small  to establish conditions under which justice and equity could be maintained and ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"".Now  four decades after that great victory  as we gather once again to take stock  the signs are cloudy in regard to the international situation.With deep concern  we note the continued worsening of the world political and economic situation owing to the persistence of serious crises and tensions in international relations  to the obstacles set up against the peoples' legitimate aspirations to emancipation and independent development without foreign interference or intervention  to the spiraling growth of the arms race resulting from the insane imperialist policy of seeking an impossible military supremacy so as to decide the fate of the world from positions of strength  and to the attempts at extending this race to outer space.Today more than ever before  the threat of nuclear extermination weighs on mankind. The policies of imperialism are characterized by the use or threat of use of force  intervention  destabilization  aggression  economic and political coercion  hegemony and oppression  while the crisis of the world capitalist system  which is growing ever deeper  brutally affects the developing countries and endangers their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  making economic development virtually impossible for them.The overwhelming foreign debt of the so-called third-world countries - an explosive phenomenon with an unquestionable political dimension - is a tragic note in the sombre panorama of the current international situation.The economic crisis is becoming evident in the unceasingly widening gap between the developed and the developing countries  many of which cannot even meet their people's basic needs or essential development requirements.Far from improving the terms of trade and overcoming the unjust structures of an obsolete international economic order  inequality is increasing  highlighting the asymmetry in relations between the two groups of countries - an asymmetry which leads to the ever greater enrichment of the capitalist countries at the expense of the decapitalization and impoverishment of third-world nations.The seriousness of the present situation and the consequences that would result from a nuclear conflagration show - if proof is needed - that there is no viable option for the survived  of the human race other than the policy of peaceful coexistence between states with different economic  social and political systems  international detente and the settlement of conflicts through exclusively peaceful Beans.On addressing the difficult problems facing the international community today  I should like. Sir  to express the satisfaction of the Cuban delegation over your election as President of the General Assembly on this significant and delicate occasion. I am sure that your recognized qualities as an experienced diplomat and your long-standing ties with this Organization will enable you to guide our labors with wisdom towards the lofty goals we all seek to achieve. We assure you of our delegation's support in carrying out your important tasks.Set on imposing their domination  the United States imperialists will stop at nothing to attain a military superiority that will allow them to negotiate from positions of strength and nuclear blackmail. In its eagerness to militarize outer space  the united States Government recently announced the beginning of anti-satellite weapons tests as part of a programs that will require expenditures of up to $95 billion by the year 2000.United States imperialism is promoting this new escalation in the arms race  which includes nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction  even though this practice increases the risks of nuclear war and thus endangers the very-survival of mankind.During the past 40 years  one united States Administration after another has the world from the so-called cold war and the policy of brinkmanship to the policy of local wars waged against third-world countries  the provocative installation of new weapons and missile systems aimed against the Soviet union and other socialist countries  and the so-called star wars - if not to State terrorism directed against revolutionary countries and peoples. They have even advanced the absurd theory that it is possible to survive a nuclear strike  and have hinted that a surprise attack could be successfully launched against the Soviet Union. Their arrogant language is filled with expressions such as ""surgical strikes"" - to be used against small countries like Nicaragua - ""covert operations"" and ""clean-up operations "" expressions that reveal the predatory  zoological nature of their foreign policy.Cuba condemns all attempts to militarize outer space - especially the united States Government's so-called strategic defense initiative - and expresses its support for the Soviet Union's proposal concerning international co-operation in the peaceful exploration of outer space in the context of the non-militarization of outer space.He welcome the holding of talks at the highest level between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. The determination and readiness of Soviet leaders to make whatever efforts are necessary to prevent a new world conflagration  to avoid a nuclear holocaust  to pat an end to the arms race and to prevent it from spreading to outer space are quite evident. He know of their firm determination to struggle for international detente  and we place our full trust in their Leninist peace policy  which embraces the hopes and aspirations of all the peoples of the world.""But""  as President Fidel Castro said in this very Hall in 1979 ""for our countries  peace is indivisible (A/34/PV.31  p. 3-5). Thus  the search for peace is a cardinal objective of our peoples and ranks among our most important concerns during this session of the General Assembly.Just as the avoidance of nuclear war is an irrenounceable historical imperative  so too is the prevention of the use of an agreement banning the possibility of nuclear war as an excuse for the proliferation of imperialist wars against those Asian  African or Latin-American countries seeking to exercise their rights to self-determination and independence and attempting to build a new life based on economic and political pluralism  on a non-capital is t option of development or on socialism.As Comrade Fidel pointed out  ""The time has therefore come for all of us to join in the task of drawing entire peoples - hundreds of millions of hum?"" beings - out of the backwardness  poverty  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy that keep them from enjoying full human dignity and pride"". (A/34/PV.31  p. 53-55) Therefore  when we invoke the need to settle conflicts by peaceful means  to avoid a terrible and final war that would end human life as we know it  to promote dialog and understanding among all states  regardless of their social and economic systems  and when we demand an end to the philosophy of plunder  so that there may be an end to the philosophy of war  we should also demand that all vestiges of colonialism be wiped off the face of the earth.The situation of the third-world countries has dramatically worsened since the beginning of this decade. Their foreign debt has multiplied  the terms of trade between the developed capitalist countries and the developing countries continue to be totally unjust and to constitute an abuse; credits are granted in unfair conditions; markets have contracted owing to protectionist measures applied by developed capitalist countries against our industrial products and raw materials; and the influx of capital  both official and private  into underdeveloped countries has been reduced - all of which contributes to the progressive deterioration of their fragile economies.The foreign debt of developing countries has already reached the impressive figure of more than $900 billion. Latin America alone now owes $360 billion  more than the total debt of all the third-world countries only six years ago. The total debt of the African countries  which is over $160 billion  has a greater per capita impact than Latin America's if  in addition to the lesser relative development of those countries  we consider the serious damage caused by drought and hunger to a large number of them.The economic crisis has overtaken and  in a way  has been thrust on the economics of the less-developed countries. He can say that we are dealing with a process that had been in the offing for some time and the consequences of which are more or less serious  depending on each country's economic resources and also on the greater or lesser efficiency with which it has been able to defend itself against the crisis or to try to overcome it.The group of non-aligned countries  which convened in Luanda a few weeks ago for the eighth ministerial meeting of the Movement  owe Western countries a total of almost $590 billion. This means that we must pay over $60 billion for debt-servicing this year alone. What could our peoples not do with such a sum of money if it were used to stimulate industry and agricultural production  to increase food production  health development and education?The insurmountable problems- generated by the existence of this swollen debt do not lie only in the difficulties which our countries face in paying the interest. While it is true that receiving credits to cover the servicing of the debt raises the level of their indebtedness in a way that calls into question any possibility of development  and therefore of eventually repaying the debt  the attempts that some countries have made to honor their commitments - in unfair conditions  as we have already seen  in which the dollar has been overvalued several tines and high interest rates prevail - have failed  owing to the serious deterioration in the terms of trade and the resultant reduction in their export earnings for this period.If we consider that the allocation of 20 per cent of export earnings to pay the foreign debt  far from solving the debt  will increase it and is practically untenable  what will happen when our countries must devote - a-i many are already doing - 57  52  45 or 36 per cent of their export earnings to this purpose? How can the sharp drop in the standard of living of the majority sectors of the population be curbed? Have the deflationary measures prescribed-by the International Monetary Fund managed to halt the desperation of the working classes  the impoverishment of the middle classes  unemployment  the increase in consumer prices  and the reduction of exports and domestic production in the developing countries?The daily papers in any Latin-American country bear witness to the contrary -as has also been evident for some time now in the statistical yearbooks of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.What is true is that the capitalist countries' protectionist measures; dumping; the over-evaluation of the dollar; the persistence of unequal terms of trade; high interest rates; and the current international monetary  financial and economic trade system as a whole - all work to the detriment of the developing countries  have prcRsct@d a reverse transfer of capital to the developed capitalist countries  and reinforce the dependence  underdevelopment and stagnation of the countries of the so-called third world.Cuba insists that it is necessary to do away with the abysmal inequality that separates our countries from the developed countries  we must therefore struggle to eradicate the poverty  hunger  sickness and illiteracy from which hundreds of millions of human beings still suffer. We aspire to a new world order  based on justice  equity and peace  to replace the unjust  unequal system which now prevails  in which  as was proclaimed in the Havana Declaration of 1979 by the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries ""wealth is still concentrated in the hands of a few powers whose wasteful economies are maintained by the exploitation of the labor as well as the transfer and plunder of the natural and other resources of the peoples of Africa  Asia  Latin America and other regions of the world."" (A/34/542  Annex  Political Declaration  para. 7)In proclaiming the unpayable and uncollected nature of the developing countries' foreign debt  we do not indulge in hyperbole  nor do we brandish propagandists slogans  as some capitalist leaders and certain elements of their press claim. We base our opinion on rigorous  scientific analysis that can be clearly demonstrated with irrefutable facts - for example  in 1984 the flight of Latin American capital to the developed capitalist countries  mainly the United States; the deterioration in the terns of trade  provoked by an increase in the prices of the industrial goods and intermediate goods that we import and a drop in the purchasing power of our export products; the artificial  arbitrary maintenance of high interest rates; and the real increase in the debt and the interest on it  due to the over-evaluation of the dollar.All of that led to the illegal plunder of more than $45 billion from our America  as Fidel Castro pointed out in his well-known interview granted to the Mexican daily newspaper Excelsior; 020 billion owing to the deterioration in the terns of exchange  $10 billion owing to excessive interest  $10 billion owing to the flight of currency and - at a conservative estimate - $5 billion owing to the over-evaluation of the dollar. He also affirmed:""Adding it all up  including what can be considered normal interest on the debt  in just one year the Latin American countries have turned over to the rich  developed world around $70 billion  of which $50 billion was in cash.""That is why we feel that it is indispensable  decisive and urgent to solve the problem of the debt. The crisis is advancing and will continue to do so. It is illusory to think it can be solved through palliatives  debt rescheduling and traditional formulas. We must get to the bottom of the problems created by under-development  which hinder our countries' development and continue to widen the gap between the industrialized and the third world countries. In addition to solving the problem of the debt  we must establish the new international economic order once and for all.""That that is feasible is shown by the capitalist countries' experience  as was pointed out on 12 September by The Wall Street Journal  which cannot be suspected of having the slightest leftist proclivities. It said:""To realize the folly of this course imposed by the IMF it is only necessary to consider western Europe in the aftermath of world War II. Suppose that the Marshall Plan had been organized by the commandant es now installed in the IMF. Those weary and indebted nations would have been pressed to further sacrifices. Instead of the aid that revived their economies  benefited the U.S. and helped stimulate the great post-war boom  IMF measures of the sort urged today would have meant a continuation of the horrors of war by other means.""The article added:""Yet in contrast to that post-war boldness the approach espoused by the IMF has led  since 1982  to a net capital inflow from the third to the first world. The only sector to which this can possibly be of advantage is the banks  which will do anything rather than write off their uncollectable loans  since this would mean confessing to their shareholders that a large amount of their assets are worthless."" The Wall Street Journal concluded:""The only answer is to write off the debt and begin again with productive loans that are not merely roll-over servicing for debt  but that will underwrite that desirable state of affairs: the net outflow of the surplus from the developed to the developing world.""In other words  as in the bank crisis of 1928  the Governments of the capitalist States should assume the third world countries' debts to private banks and stimulate a new flow of resources for development  which could very well come from a low percentage of their military expenditures. Ten per cent or  if the interest remains high  12 per cent of their military expenditure would suffice  and those expenditures would still be.fabulously high and give cause for concern.We hope that the United Nations  as an irreplaceable forum for examining and helping to solve the main economic and political problems of our time  will make a positive contribution to the solution of the thorny problems of the foreign debt  together with the efforts that are already being made to convene an international conference on monetary and financial resources for development.In mentioning the dramatic situation presently faced by the underdeveloped countries as a result of the capitalist economic crisis surrounding them and of the unequal exchange holding them back  we cannot forget the tragedy nature has just inflicted on one of them  a respected member of the United Nations community and a Latin American sister nation  Mexico. Mexico's grief is shared by all the people of Cuba  who are linked to Mexico not only by geographical proximity and the fact that they belong to Latin America and the Caribbean  but also by unbreakable bonds of history and affection  we reiterate our sympathy for and solidarity with Mexico at this unfortunate time for its people.In conveying Cuba's condolences to the Government and people of Mexico  and our readiness to assist. President Fidel Castro urged Mexico's creditor countries to suspend servicing of the foreign debt so that Mexico might - with the integrity it has already shown - face up to the effects of the disaster now afflicting the country. That would be a way of alleviating its terrible situation. Mexico needs real and effective solidarity  not crumbs from the International Monetary Fund.Today the unity of Latin America and the Caribbean - above and beyond ideologies and ideas that might be opposed on certain issues - is more urgent and necessary than ever before  in order to tackle the huge problems  overwhelming them. It is regrettable that at such a time we heard from this rostrum in Latin American words a repetition of the vile slanders and rotten arguments developed in Washington  in an attempt to obscure the irrefutable signs and the only possible solutions  put forward by those who have for a quarter of a century  with unique firmness and heroism  resisted blockade  military aggression  economic siege and attempts to isolate them politically  and who have practiced genuine internationalism everywhere in the world. It is regrettable because we know those infamous suggestions are a product of consultations and capitulations in the belief that the empire would forgive them for their timid and compromised rebellion. It is regrettable because what is being stridently presented as a drastic solution and a realistic way out will be converted into tithing that will perpetuate dependence and bar the path to the only worthy  moral  profound and true solution.We will not allow ourselves to be drawn into dissension  we reaffirm the commitment by President Fidel Castro that those who are attacked or harassed for defending the rights of their peoples to reject - through whichever formula they may choose - the misery that would be wrought upon them by demanding that they repay their foreign debt will have Cuba's support. But we doubt that those who pick their arguments from the arsenal of imperialism  those who repeat Yankee slanders  will be able to make good their promises and hoist with firm hands the colors they seek to uphold before world public opinion. Latin America's history is replete with such outdated  prevaricating redeemers.As the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries stated in the Luanda Declaration a few weeks ago  Latin America and the Caribbean are one of the areas of the world which have suffered most directly from acts of aggression by colonial and imperialist Powers. The Ministers noted with deep concern that the situation in Central America now constituted one of the main focal points of tension in the international arena and that  notwithstanding repeated appeals by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the rest of the international community  as well as efforts by the Contadora Group to find a negotiated solution  the situation in that area was continuing to deteriorate as a result of the implementation of imperialist policies of interference and intervention. This  together with the poverty and oppression to which the region has been subjected throughout its history  constitutes a real threat to international peace and security. In this regard  they observed that the danger of direct United States intervention in Nicaragua  Cuba and other countries of the region had increased alarmingly.The non-aligned countries were not mistaken when they described the situation in our part of the world in such severe terms. Age-old hunger  lack of land  jobs  schools  hospitals and political rights  continued humiliation  and other abuses of all kinds have filled the people with a hatred of tyrants and a longing for a freedom that they do not yet enjoy. Those are the true roots of the social revolution that the imperialists are trying to crush by establishing an enormous military apparatus in the territories adjoining Nicaragua.Bands of counter-revolutions continue to penetrate Nicaraguan territory from Costa Rica and Honduras. They are trained  armed and financed and receive logistical support from the United States Government; they commit abominable crimes against farmers and other inhabitants of small settlements. During this period the number of Attacks  military actions and other measures against the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  stability and self-determination of Nicaragua has increased.Its air space and territorial waters are still being violated  and joint military maneuvers of a purely intimidatory nature by United States  together with those of other states in the region  are still going on  emphasizing the threats of surgical operations or selective bombardments against Sandino's homeland.Since the creation of the Contadora Group in 1983  Cuba has expressed its support for that Group's goals of searching for a peaceful  negotiated solution for the Central American conflict. Nicaragua has expressed its willingness to sign the Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  of 7 September 1984  which was the result of long and arduous discussions by the parties concerned. However  the United States Government - which until then had been making hypocritical statements in support of the efforts of the Latin American countries - mobilized its allies in the area to prevent the adoption of any formula that would proscribe military interference in an area which it considers its backyard.The situation is no less critical in El Salvador  where increased united States military aid to the genocidal Government has resulted in a worsening of the conflict and taken a toll of thousands of victims among the civilian population in the territories controlled by the Salvadorian patriots. The revolutionary forces  grouped in the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the Revolutionary Democratic Front  have given convincing proof not only of their willingness but also of their capacity to undertake a serious dialog with the Government  without any strings attached  in order to find a peaceful  negotiated solution in accord with the aspirations of the Salvadorian people and the overwhelming majority of the international community. That dialog  which was unilaterally broken off by the Government  should be resumed as soon as possible.Cuba supports the Cantadora Group's genuine Latin—American initiative and hails the backing it has received- from the Governments of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay. It calls on all interested States to speed up negotiations aimed at achieving an Act acceptable to all the Central American States and demands that the United States Government end all its military  economic and political acts of aggression against the legitimate Government of Nicaragua.No examination of the situation in Latin America and the Caribbean would be complete without mention of the criminal United States invasion of the tiny island of Grenada which so brutally destroyed that sister country's aspirations to national sovereignty and freedom  once more reducing it to the sad condition of a semi-colony under the Yankee imperial boot  in defiance of decisions of this Assembly. We express our deep aversion to the presence in this hall of those who claiming to represent Grenada are thus staining the immortal principles of those who  together with the unforgettable Maurice Bishop  once proclaimed the genuine independence of that country.Also in the Caribbean  the people of Betances  Hostos  Albizu Campos and Corretjer are still seeking recognition of their right to self-determination and independence  as was seen in the united Nations special Committee on decolonization some months ago. In reaffirming the full applicability of resolution 1514 (XV) to Puerto Rico  the Committee expressed the international community's hope that the Puerto Rican people would be able freely to exercise their rights without outside interference and that they would be able to determine their political status in keeping with their Latin American and Caribbean identity. From this rostrum  we once again reiterate our lasting solidarity with the Puerto Rican people and its ideals of freedom.Together with the other Foreign Ministers of non-aligned countries who net in Luanda  we reiterate the need to do away with colonialism in all its forms and manifestations in Latin America and the Caribbean and express our concern at the fact that colonial Powers are using territories in the region as bases or ports of call for ships carrying nuclear weapons or for storing such weaponry.In this regard  we denounce the existence of imperialist military bases in Puerto Rico  at Guantanamo  in the Malvinas Islands and in other parts of Latin America  because they constitute a threat to our countries' security and peace in the region.He express our support for the legitimate expectations of the Panamanian people and Government that the agreements on the Panama Canal and on the neutrality of that inter-oceanic waterway be strictly observed.- He also firmly support the right of the Argentine Republic to reestablish its sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands through negotiations with the Government of the United Kingdom  with the participation and good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  and we endorse Bolivia's legitimate and just claim to have restored to it a direct  useful outlet to the Pacific Ocean  with full sovereignty over such an area.He trust that the establishment of democratic Governments in Argentina  Brazil and Uruguay will represent a new stage in Latin America and deal a powerful blow to the imperialists hegemonistic pretentions in the region. The broad avenues of freedom foreseen by President Salvador Allende will open up sooner  rather than later  for his still unredeemed people  who are struggling courageously against Pinochet's cruel tyranny. The people's steadfast determination to exercise their sovereignty without restrictions of any kind will be shared in Latin America.Our Government places particular importance on the situation prevailing in southern Africa where the racist regime in Pretoria  a strategic ally of United States imperialism  illegally continues to occupy the Territory of Namibia in flagrant violation of resolutions of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement and other international forums.Thanks to President Reagans ""constructive engagement"" with Mr. Botha's fascists. South Africa is persisting in its policy of bantustanization and the exportation of apartheid  attempting to impose a puppet government on Namibia  facilitating the plundering of that Territory by Yankee and other imperialist transnational corporations and ruthlessly repressing the Namibian patriots. Cuba hails the heroic Namibian combatants and reiterates its support for that people's legitimate struggle  led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole legitimate representative.The duplicity of the United States Government and its racist associates has become obvious  for  on the pretext of holding talks with the People's Republic of Angola with a view to finding a solution for Namibia's independence and for the situation in southern Africa  they have been playing for time in order  to shore up the apartheid regime in South Africa  to expand and strengthen their control in Namibia  to weaken and divide the front-line States and to intimidate other independent neighboring States.This maneuver was revealed when  in spite of the steps taken by the Government of the People's Republic of Angola in compliance with the Lusaka Agreements and with the talks held at Cape Verde and Luanda that were announced by President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos in a letter addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the racist South Africa troops continued to occupy a part of Angolan territory. Both the United States and South Africa continued fully to support the counterrevolutionaries who are trying to destabilize Angola  and a commando team of the racist special forces went into Cabinda to sabotage the oil installations there  to paralyze the.country's economy  attributing the action to the counterrevolutionary forces. This was done in order to intimidate the heroic Angolan people  to prevent the holding of the Ministerial Meeting of the non-aligned countries in the region and to make the world believe that the revolutionary Government was approaching its end.The facts are that the Angolan armed forces quickly and efficiently defeated the South African aggressors and prevented them from carrying out their criminal plans in Cabinda  plans that would have taken hundreds of lives  including those of the United States technicians working there for Gulf Oil. The bands of counterrevolutionaries are being dealt heavy losses; the so-called victories of the UNXTA traitors occur only in the Lisbon newspapers and the non-aligned Ministerial Meeting was held in Luanda in absolute peace and quiet with the warn hospitality of that courageous people.The South African racists have once again shown their arrogance and contempt for world public opinion.More them 120 countries sent delegations to the Ministerial Meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Luanda  Angola  and over half of those delegations were headed by Ministers. That constituted a powerful expression of the Movement's solidarity with the Angolan people in their struggle in defense of their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the course of the ten years that have passed since Angola achieved its independence it has repulsed continual acts of aggression by the racist Pretoria regime.The first decision adopted at the Ministerial Meeting at Luanda was to send a warm message of solidarity to Nelson Mandela in his apartheid prison. South Africa responded in its customary style  with a new attack on Angola. On 16 September South African troops invaded Angolan territory and the South African air forces penetrated deep into Angola's air space in order to attack the units of the Angolan armed forces that were pursuing fleeing UNITAR bands in Mavinga in Cuando-Cubango Province.The Pretoria racists place no limits on their actions and do not hesitate to violate even the most elementary norms of international law in their vain attempts to save their servants in the UNITA counterrevolutionary bands from inexorable defeat. The Security Council must denounce South Africa for this flagrant new evidence of its attitude  which violates the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.It Is therefore imperative for us to continue to support the struggle of the Namibian people by all possible means until final victory is won. In this regard Cuba supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on the. question of Namibia in 1986 and the holding of an international consultative conference on this question in Western Europe during the course of that same year. It also supports the imposition of mandatory comprehensive sanctions against South Africa in conformity with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations if Pretoria refuses to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and other Security Council resolutions on Namibia.Because of its policies and practices the racist Pretoria regime is th'i main cause of the violence and instability in southern Africa. Its brutal acts of oppression  repression and discrimination against the black population have recently been stepped up with the arbitrary detention  arrest and imprisonment of opponents of the apartheid regime and the imposition of a state of emergency  all of which reached alarming proportions with a brutal massacre of the defenseless population  including children.There is no doubt that this hideous system of discrimination and exploitation practiced by the fascist white minority against the overwhelming majority of the South African people is possible only because of the unlimited support given it by the United States Government and the aid given it by other western countries and Israel.The growing movement against apartheid in Western Europe  North America Australasia and other parts of the world reveals the worldwide opposition to this monstrous system  which the United Nations has described as a crime against mankind  and there is a growing demand that economic  financial  military  political and diplomatic support for the Pretoria regime be ended.In concert with all progressive men and women we call for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela  Zephania  Mothopeng and all the other patriots and political prisoners who are confined in South African prisons? we also call for respect for the prisoner-of-war status of all freedom fighters who have been captured  in conformity with the 1949 Geneve Convention and of Article 44 of Protocol 1 annexed to that Convention. The application of mandatory comprehensive sanctions against the racist Pretoria regime will help to speed the downfall of the iniquitous system of oppression  exploitation and discrimination that  to the shameof their leaders  the racists and their imperialist allies maintain in the southern cone of Africa. It is necessary that the Security Council adopt them as soon as possible. Cuba reiterates its militant support for the South African combatants in the heroic Umkhonto we Sizwe  the armed branch of the African National Congress  the sole  legitimate representative of the South African people.We support the Sahraoui people's legitimate cause and their right to self-determination and independence in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.In the year of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV)  the Magna Carta of decolonization  we insist on the restitution of Madagascar's sovereignty over the islands of Europa  Juan de Nova  Glorieuses and Bassas da India. We affirm our solidarity with the Comorians in their aspiration to recover the island of Mayotte and with Mauritius in its struggle to recover Diego Garcia. We support the cause of the abolition of colonialism in Africa  Asia and Latin America before the end of this century in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the Charter of the United Nations. And we call on all Member States of the United Nations to redouble their efforts to fulfill this sacred mandate of the peoples as soon as possible.The situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate as a result of Israel's aggressive and expansionist policies in the region  in which it has the support- and complicity of the imperialist United States Government.As has been said countless times  the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the crisis in the Middle East and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Since they are inextricably linked  no partial or isolated solution can lead to just  comprehensive  lasting peace in the region. Such peace can be based only on thetotal  unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories  including Jerusalem and on recognition of the Palestinian people's inalienable rights  including the right to return to their homeland and their homes  the right to self-determination without outside interference and the right to establish their own independent  sovereign State in Palestine.Cuba reiterates its solidarity with the Palestinian people's cause and calls for the prompt holding of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of that people which has suffered for so long.We call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and the re-establishment of the Lebanese people's national sovereignty over their territory up to its internationally recognized borders.We condemn United States imperialism's strategic alliance with expansionist  exclusivist Zionism against the Arab and African countries  in connivance with South Africa's racist regime  and especially the nuclear collaboration between South Africa and Israel  which endangers international peace and security.The situation in the Republic of Cyprus continues to be a cause of concern to the international community. We deplore the Turkish Cypriot leadership's unilateral declaration of independence of 15 November 1983. we consider it to bo legally null and void. We believe that serious negotiations between the two communities and the good offices of the Secretary—General are necessary to arrive at a just and viable solution of the Cypriot question that ensures for the Cypriot people independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status.As in the past  we are in favor of increasing the efforts of the united Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to put an end to the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  which has already taken a heavy toll in human lives and property.In South-East Asia  threats and acts of aggression continue against the Indo-Chinese countries  for which we reaffirm our support. We endorse the successes of the People's Republic of Kampuchea in its struggle to do away with the remnants of Pol Pot's savagery and to build a new life. We wish to make known our disagreement with the presence in the United Nations of the executioners of the Kampuchean people  who are basely linked to the Yankee imperialists  who put Lon Nol in power and attacked the Kampuchean people. They are usurping the seat of the People's Republic.With regard to South-west Asia  we favor seeking a solution on the basis of the consultations being promoted by the Secretary-General of the united Nations  with full respect for the political  economic and social options of each of the peoples of the region and for their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status.We hail the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea  free of all foreign interference  by means of dialog and consultations between the north and the south in accordance with the principles of independence  peaceful reunification and national unity  as expressed in the Joint Declaration of 4 June 1972. The peaceful reunification of Korea must inevitably be supplemented by the withdrawal of the united States troops occupying the southern part of the peninsula.In advocating the continuance of such efforts we feel compelled to express our concern at the fact that the forthcoming Olympic Games have been scheduled to be held in only one part of Korea  the south. This reflects a deplorable political decision on the part of those who direct the Olympic movement and is contrary to the spirit of the Olympic Games and the aspirations to brotherhood and friendship among peoples and mutual understanding embodied in the Olympic ideal. We are in favor of the Olympic Games being held throughout the Korean peninsula  both north and south  so as to safeguard the Olympic movement and to make a positive contribution to the peaceful reunification of and mutual understanding between the two parts of the country.Ever since its founding on 24 October 1945  the United Nations has played a vital role in international relations. The aims and objectives expressed in its Charter are as relevant  powerful and significant today as they ever were. The world we wish to build  a world in which weapons have been turned into plough shares and the use of force has been abolished except in the service of common interests  is far from a reality.During those 40 years  however  old colonial empires have disappeared; people:: in Asia and Africa that used to be oppressed have won their national liberation struggles and attained independence; the socialist camp has been established and over two thirds of mankind have been freed from the exploitation of man by man. Furthermore  at the initiative of the Soviet Union and with the support of the third world  the international community adopted in 1960 the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Since then  dozens of third-world peoples and territories  some of them in Latin America and the Caribbean  have freed themselves from the colonial yoke.The task is not yet completed of course  as the cases of South Africa  the Malvinas Islands  the colonial situation of Namibia  the islands in the South Pacific  Puerto Rico and other Caribbean territories bear witness. It is for this Organization  together with the struggling peoples of those territories  to speed the hour of their final liberation. Throughout these four decades the United Nations system has been strengthened and extended. Its specialized agencies have been responsible for important achievements in several fields of international relations and especially in the process of decolonization. Such agencies as the United Nations Educational  Scientific land Cultural Organization  the united Nations Children's Fund  the United Nations Development program  the world Health Organization  the United Nations Fund for Population Activities  the World Food Council and the United Nations Environment program have made valuable contributions to cur countries' development and to understanding among the peoples.The United Nations has been and still is the ideal forum in which to discuss the problems of economic development and international' economic relations. If there have not been greater achievements  that is due not to any fault on the part of the Organization but to the lack of political will on the part of some Western countries. The Declaration and program of Action on the establishment of a new international economic order are historic documents whose implementation would radically modify international relations.In spite of its limitations  the Security Council is a useful instrument for watching over the preservation of international peace and security. Those limitations  it must be admitted  stem from the correlation of forces throughout the world and from the existence of a small number of imperialist States which refuse to give up their privileges  spheres of influence and hegemonist ambitions.The abuse of the rule of unanimity - the veto - has prevented the imposition of sanctions against Israel and South Africa for their acts of aggression against independent Arab and African countries  respectively  and for South Africa's refusal to abide by the United Nations resolutions on Namibia and the policies and practice of apartheid.Nevertheless ' the fact remains that the United Nations has managed to prevent the outbreak of another world war  and this  in itself  has been a major contribution to the cause of peace.In expressing its full support for all efforts to strengthen and extend the United Nations system and to reinforce its role in solving the main problems with which mankind is faced in the fields of economics  health  education^ science  culture  information and communications  and in preserving international peace and security  Cuba denounces the policies of pressure and blackmail that have been applied against the united Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other specialized agencies; these constitute an attack on multi-lateralism and on the united Nations system itself.The campaigns which have been waged against our Organization in the United States and in other western countries are not aimed at making healthy or even necessary criticism in order to increase the efficiency and the results or productivity of the system; rather  they seek to undermine and destroy it because it is a forum in which contemporary problems can be taken up and solved. We are and always will be opposed to any attempt to reduce  weigh down or prevent the important work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in their different fields.We feel that one of the most outstanding achievements of the last few years has been the adoption of the Convention on the Law of the Sea  signed by 159 countries and ratified by 21 to date. In this regard  the position of the united States Government - which refused to sign it - and its decision to grant licenses to private corporations to engage in prospecting activities in parts of the Zone  in violation of General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) and of article 137 of the Convention  should be vigorously condemned by the international community.He are in favor of the establishment of the new international information and communications order as an invaluable contribution to the cause of decolonization in this vital area of relations among peoples; we are also in favor of scientific education and the free and thorough education of the human person. The peoples' basic rights include the right to self-determination  development  work and an independent life.Sports are also a right of the people and it is high time for them to be practiced by all  on an equal footing  without hierarchies or small groups deciding on where sports events shall be held and who will participate in them  without consulting the people. He believe that the United Nations is the appropriate Organization for promoting sports  since its universal nature makes it the depository par excellence of the high ideals of the Olympic Games.The Cuban people  which has been constructing socialism 90 miles from the strongest imperialist Power for the last 26 years and has managed to withstand every blow with firmness and heroism and victoriously to defend its independence and national sovereignty  is still ready to set aside its tools and take up weapons with who to defend itself and to defeat whoever attempts to conquer its territory.On reiterating our support for the United Nations on the fortieth anniversary of its founding  we also reiterate our faith in justice  freedom  independence  development and equality for all people. As Jose Marti said  ""Man is more than race  more than white or black."" The Cuban Revolution is for this universal man; for mankind without exploited or exploiters; and for peace for all States  both large and small.Today  to this august assembly  we reiterate our firm commitment to struggle tirelessly  alongside the United Nations  for the construction of a better world."
"34",1760,"CYP",40,1985,"It is with particular pleasure that I extend to Ambassador de Pinies our warm congratulations on his well-deserved election to the high office of the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. We consider his personality  his reputation as an experienced and skilled diplomat  and his long-standing commitment to the cause of the United Nations as the best guarantees for the successful accomplishment of his difficult task. His far-sighted opening statement has been most reassuring and has confirmed our belief in the wise guidance he will provide us during the current session. Furthermore  it is a source of great satisfaction for my Government and for the people of Cyprus that the presidency of this lofty body is in the hands of a representative of a friendly country  with which we share close relations and which rightfully enjoys great esteem and reputation internationally.At the same time  I wish to extend our appreciation to his predecessor. Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  a country with which we have excellent relations  for the most competent way in which he guided the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I should like from the outset to place on record our gratitude for the Secretary-General's efforts to promote international peace and security. We also thank him for his untiring efforts with regard to the Cyprus problem  which has been the concern of the United Nations and his own personal concern. I should be remiss if I did not stress how much we value his efforts towards achieving a just and viable solution to the problem in accordance with the United Nations principles and resolutions.The disaster inflicted upon Mexico fay the recent catastrophic earthquakes has shocked us all. We express-our deep sympathy and solidarity with the friendly people and Government of Mexico and call upon this body immediately to implement an emergency program for the alleviation of the plight of the victims of this devastating calamity. Mexico is suffering from a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions  and we strongly believe that an urgent international response is essential to assist this nation to recover as soon as possible. In this respect we fully appreciate the urgency with which the General Assembly responded to this critical situation by adopting resolution 40/1 of 24 September 1985  which we fully support.As we celebrate this Organization's fortieth anniversary  we cannot but think of our founding fathers who sought to transform into action the deeply felt and widespread desire for concrete and effective action by establishing an Organization based on universality  with the aim of protecting and maintaining international peace and security  the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms  the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples  the development of friendly relations among nations and the achievement of international co-operation in solving international problems.In evaluating the progress achieved so far in international relations  we should ask ourselves if we may claim that we are well on our way to realizing the dreams and aspirations of the founding fathers of this Organization. We must admit  with regret  that the record gives little cause for satisfaction  as we enter the fortieth year of the life of this Organization.This does not mean that the past was devoid of successes  since reference can be made to many achievements of this Organization. He could mention progress made in various fields: decolonization  peace-keeping  standard setting in the field of human rights and the humanitarian programs. That we have so far escaped the scourge of another world war  despite local conflicts  is no minor achievement.Although we all share the same aspirations for peace  security and justice  it is a sad commentary on the 40 years that have just elapsed that the international political and economic situation is again critical. The threat or actual use of force  military aggression and interference  the intensified arms race  gross violations of human rights  poverty and famine paint a gloomy picture of today's world. Yet  however frustrating our experience has been so far  we have not abandoned hope that the dream of a peaceful and economically secure future can yet become a reality.The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations affords us the opportunity to take stock of progress  concentrate on shortcomings  draw appropriate conclusions and chart the correct course to ensure peace and survival. Renewed confidence in the United Nations can be enhanced only if all Member States adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter  thus rendering the Organization more effective. The provisions and mechanisms of the Charter  if appropriately  effectively and resolutely applied  could deter lawlessness and secure peace and justice.The Security Council should live up to the expectations of mankind  employing all means at its disposal  and it should also take such other measures as those referred to by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  which we welcome and support. Particular reference should be made to the Secretary-General's idea that the Security Council should""make a deliberate and concerted effort to solve one or two of the major problems before it by making fuller use of the measures available to it under the Charter"" (A/40/1  p. 7).The single most important issue affecting the international community is disarmament. The continued build-up of armaments  particularly nuclear armaments  creates potentially dangerous conditions  holding mankind hostage to the balance of terror and the threat of nuclear war. Moreover  the increasing military expenditures are diverting valuable resources from development which could close the widening gap between the developed and developing countries. It is earnestly hoped that this year will be marked by real progress towards disarmament.Closely and directly tied to disarmament is international security. The ultimate goal of complete and total disarmament is unachievable unless the collective security provisions of the Charter are fully implemented. Let us hope that during the fortieth anniversary the Member States  particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  take up this issue as a question of urgency.It has always been our firm belief that implementation of the security provisions of the Charter  along with actions to implement United Nations resolutions  in particular Security Council resolutions  would lead to an improved world situation by eliminating critical issues that threaten the maintenance of international peace and security.Of equal concern is the world economic situation. Though there was a certain improvement in the case of industrialized countries earlier this year  the developing countries' plight continues unabated. They are burdened with a multitude of problems  both structural and developmental  often compounded by natural disasters. Commodities prices  trade  financing and debt servicing are matters requiring urgent attention and even more urgent remedial action.The international community must act decisively in moving without delay towards the establishment of a new international economic order; otherwise the increasingly divergent world economic and social conditions and difficulties will exert severe pressures on the developing countries* social and political fabric  with unforeseen consequences  including possible underlining of their democratic institutions.The grave economic crisis facing African countries gives cause for concern and requires the urgent adoption of special and concrete actions for resolving that crisis  while the Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa which was adopted last year at the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly provided a framework for international action  there is still much to be done  particularly in the field of assistance in the development efforts of the African States themselves. In dealing with this problem  the Non-Aligned Movement formulated a Plan of Action which was adopted at the Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement held in New Delhi from 19 to 21 April 1985.Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  a number of standard-setting instruments in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms have been promulgated. More recently a welcome trend towards the establishment of implementation mechanisms has been observed. Cyprus is a party to many of these instruments; the two International Covenants on civil and political rights and social  economic and cultural rights  the Convention against racial discrimination and  most recently  the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  to name some examples.Notwithstanding progress in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms  there is continuing concern for the massive  flagrant and persistent violations of human rights that are taking place in various parts of the world  especially when they cone in the wake of occupation and aggression or threaten democracy.In world affairs the Non-Aligned Movement increasingly plays a positive and constructive role in working for a just world order based on its lofty principles  pronounced at the Bandung Conference and further elaborated at subsequent meetings.Cyprus  a founding member of the Movement  will continue its role in the Movement  as it has done before  underlining the principles of the non-use of force in international relations and of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. The people of Cyprus are particularly grateful for the Movement's principled stand and support on the Cyprus problems. High appreciation is given to the non-aligned countries' contact group on the Cyprus problem  which are always rendered valuable assistance and support.The Conference on Security and co-operation in Europe is an important and dynamic ongoing process. Cyprus actively participates in that Conference and co-operates particularly with the other neutral and non-aligned States that are taking part in an effort to promote security in Europe and hence in the whole world.The non-implementation of United Nations resolutions not only impairs the effectiveness of the Organization but also erodes its credibility and its image as an instrument for peace and justice. It will be recalled that at the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  the President of the Republic of Cyprus in his address to the Assembly  requested the inscription of an item entitled ""Implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations"". It should also be recalled that the Non-Aligned Movement has repeatedly welcomed and supported the consideration of the question of the implementation of United Nations resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly.We are happy that  as a result of the inclusion of this item in the agenda and of the support it received from the membership of the United Nations  informal consultations were held by members of the Security Council on title strengthening of the authority and the effectiveness of the United Nations. It is the intention of the delegation of Cyprus to work with other interested delegations for the achievement of this goal.As we have stated on numerous occasions  the Middle Bast problem  at the core of which is the question of Palestine  gives rise to grave concern. Cyprus  along with other non-aligned countries  fully supports the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish an independent state pursuant to General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX). He again stress the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and call for full respect of the human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population in the occupied Arab lands.The persistence of the problem poses a serious threat not only to peace in the region but also to international peace and security. High in our priorities must be the intensification of the efforts for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab lands occupied since 1967. We shall continue to support the just struggle of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole and legitimate representative.Cyprus  a close neighbor of friendly Lebanon  shares the agony of that country and will continue to provide any help necessary  as we have been doing order the last few years. He fervently hope that the factional strife will end and that national reconciliation will be achieved so that the people of that nation will be able to prosper again in peace and tranquility. Once again we express our full support for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unity of Lebanon and call for the total withdrawal of all Israeli forces from its territory.The Iran-Iraq conflict continues unabated. We are deeply grieved that two non-aligned countries are involved in such a confrontation  which has brought about massive destruction and great loss of life. We are deeply disturbed that a just and honorable solution has not yet been found. We earnestly hope that every effort will be exerted with a view to reaching such a solution for the normalization of the situation in the region and the restoration of peace.Recent developments in South Africa  and in particular the imposition of a state of emergency in a large number of districts  which was accompanied by an escalation in violence and repression by the South African forces against the oppressed majority  have once again attracted attention and widespread condemnation of the apartheid regime. We fully support all United Nations and non-aligned resolutions on this issue  particularly the recent Security Council resolution 569 (1985)  which condemned the apartheid regime and the South African imposition of a state of emergency  as well as the mass arrests and detentions recently carried out by the Pretoria Government and the murders which have been committed. The resolution fully acknowledged once again the legitimate aspirations of the people of South Africa to benefit from all civil and political rights and to establish a united  non-racial and democratic society. We fully endorse this resolution. We call upon the Security Council to proceed urgently to consider action under Chapter VII of the Charter  so that an end may be put as soon as possible to the abhorrent system of apartheid.While we are gravely concerned about the situation in South Africa itself  we are equally concerned over developments in Namibia  including the recent incursions  and over the lack of progress in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia.This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and at the same time the fortieth year of intensive efforts by the United Nations to bring about the independence of Namibia. Despite these solemn declarations and the efforts of the international community to put an end to colonialism and to ensure genuine independence for Namibia  South Africa's intransigence has blocked all progress.In its latest attempt to circumvent the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia  the South African regime proceeded with its plans for a so-called internal settlement in Namibia by promoting puppet political institutions.The refusal of South Africa to comply with the wish of the international community  as expressed in the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  has been condemned by the Security Council and prompted the Non-Aligned Movement to convene an extraordinary plenary meeting of its Co-ordinating Bureau on the question of Namibia in New Delhi in April 1985.Cyprus fully supports the heroic struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole authentic representative. We shall continue to provide every possible assistance to the efforts made to achieve Namibia's genuine independence.The position of Cyprus on the question of Western Sahara is fully in line with that of the Non-Aligned Movement  as expressed in its various declarations  including that of the seventh summit meeting  held in March 1983. We express the hope that a solution will be found along these lines.The Central American region remains a hotbed of tension. The situation remains volatile and poses serious threats to regional and international peace. The need for dialog instead of armed conflict cannot be overstressed. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region  as well as non-interference in their internal affairs  are principles from which there can be no deviation.The situation concerning Nicaragua has been of deep concern to the international community and the Non-Aligned Movement over the last few years. The Hon-Aligned Movement has considered developments there repeatedly and has expressed its solidarity and support to the Government of Nicaragua  while actions aimed against the Government and people of Nicaragua have been strongly condemned.The efforts of the Contadora Group  which we fully support  have not yet come to fruition. We hope that all concerned will co-operate constructively with the Group and will continue to work towards a negotiated peaceful solution to the problems of Central America.While celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations we are bound to focus our attention on our own country  the small  historic island of Cyprus  where the Charter of the United Nations  its purposes and principles  and indeed the whole concept and effectiveness of this Organization are being tested.There can be no excuse and no justification for the continuous military occupation of a significant part of Cyprus for 11 years now in complete defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  an occupation which constitutes a sad reminder of flagrant violations not only of human rights but of almost everything that this Organization stands for and  at the same time  poses a distinct challenge to its authority. In this fortieth anniversary year  our people are bewildered and wonder how  despite the principles of the Charter  the occupation of 37 per cent of our territory is allowed to continue; why they were expelled from their homes and to this day are denied voluntary return in conditions of safety  as required by United Nations resolutions; why 50 000 settlers from Turkey were transplated into their hones; why an occupation army is still allowed to remain on our soil.Likewise  they know that there exists no justification for the destruction of the cultural heritage being attempted in the occupied area  no justification whatsoever for the divisionist acts which have taken place in the occupied areas and which culminated in the proclamation of a so-called state and subsequent illegal acts in complete disregard and defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions 541 (1938) and 550 (1984)  which declared such acts null and void.I reiterate once again our firm support for the mission of good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General and his initiative aimed at finding a just and viable solution to the problem. We co-operate fully and constructively with the Secretary-General and have all along helped him in his difficult task. This cooperation will continue with sincerity and good will. He call on all to do likewise and assist him in his efforts to find a solution of the problem. Our response to his latest initiative was positive and unequivocal and our reply was in the affirmative. This has already been referred to by the Secretary-General in his latest report to the Security Council  dated June 1985.The solution of the Cyprus problem must conform fully to the principles of the Charter  the relevant United Nations resolutions and the High Level Agreements. Turkey must abandon its partionist designs and any other plans to control or dominate Cyprus  directly or indirectly. I would like to reiterate what I have stated recently  that to strive for a solution of the problem is a duty we owe to ourselves  but  furthermore  to strive to reverse the effects of aggression is a duty that is owed to the world at large."
"35",1828,"DDR",40,1985,"Permit me first of all to assure the people and the Government of Mexico of the firm solidarity of the German Democratic Republic; the first relief supplies for the people affected by the earthquakes have arrived in Mexico City. As recommended in the relevant General Assembly resolution  my country will continue to help alleviate the disastrous effects of that catastrophe.Mr. President  please accept ray warm congratulations on your election. I wish you and the Secretary-General success in your work. To the President of the thirty-ninth session  Mr. Paul Lusaka  go my thanks for his judicious work.It is appropriate  indeed necessary  to recall today at this anniversary session of the United Nations  that 40 years ago the States and peoples allied in the anti-Hitler coalition ended the Second World War with victory over fascism. That victory was possible because those united in the coalition had jointly and resolutely resisted the menace to world civilization.It was under the influence of that most devastating of all wars that States then established the United Nations Organization. Ever since  the supreme precept of the United Nations Charter ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" has remained valid.Current international developments demonstrate the utmost relevance of that call  for the danger of war since 1945 has never been as threatening as it is today. In this situation  the peoples look to the United Nations with justified expectations. The Organization's capabilities to forge a new coalition of peace against war are now incomparably greater than they were 40 years ago. This requires  of course  the single-mindedness of all its Members.The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State  Erich Honecker  only recently reaffirmed the following on behalf of the German Democratic Republic: ""Peace  which was won at the end of the Second World War at the expense of the heaviest toll of blood  is the supreme guiding principle of our Government's policy and a basic concern of every citizen...""""We have worked for it on a broad front to this date  and we shall notrelent in our search for practical solutions through internationalco-operation to address those problems on which a secure peace depends.""The European nations know from their own bitter experience that their security has always been inseparably bound up with the security of frontiers. The same is true today. Respect for political and territorial realities is elementary to living together in peace. Hence the emphasis placed by the German Democratic Republic on this obligatory knowledge  which was incorporated in the joint statement issued on 12 March 1985 on the Moscow meeting of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the German Democratic Republic Council of State  Erich Honecker  with the Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Helmut Kohl.In full conformity with the principles of the United Nations that document notes that the inviolability of frontiers and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all European States in their present boundaries are a basic condition of peace. The German Democratic Republic sticks to these principles. It acts true to its supreme maxim to do everything so that never again will war butonly peace emanate from German soil.Four decades of post-war development have proved that unqualified recognition of the existence of two sovereign German States independent from each other and normal relations between them  based on international law  are corner-stones of peace in Europe. The German Democratic Republic supports the assessments made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in regard to the enhancement of the effectiveness and responsibility of the world Organization cm the basis of its Charter.Like him it is looking for an answer to the question of how most effectively to build on the accomplishments of the United Nations and on the purposes and principles of its Charter and thus how to employ all the Organization's efficacy in order to avert the risk of a nuclear holocaust and to make use of the rich potential of a world at peace. The vitality and usefulness of the Charter  which represents a significant milestone in the process of the democratization of international relations  have stood the test of time. Of great value has been the world Organization's basic principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members  which  though unequal in size  population or political system  are equal in their rights and duties. Its Members equally share a high responsibility for peace and an equal right to build their future under its protective wing.That holds good for times of relaxed international relations and especially when a tense or even dangerously aggravated situation calls for prudent  predictable action by all States.The sovereign equality of all States means equal security for all; it means the non-pursuit of military superiority and domination; it means an equal right to peace and an equal right to life.The right to peace requires  above all  practical moves for the prevention of nuclear war and the abandonment of doctrines which proclaim that such a war can be fought and won and which stimulate preparatory measures for it.The right to life calls for co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and of nuclear energy  rather than for forcing the pace of the arms race or for the militarization of outer space.The recent initiatives of the Soviet Union concerning international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of space under conditions of its non-militarization and concerning a moratorium on nuclear explosions are both exemplary and encouraging steps. The plans of ""Star Wars"" and of the militarization of space  as have been recently initiated with the test of an anti-satellite weapon against a target in space  have thus been countered with the concept of ""Star Peace"". The implementation of the latter plan could unite the efforts of States for the peaceful exploration of space and for the utilization of space technologies for the benefit of all peoples.Peace on earth and in space: that remains our aim. We are pursuing it with all consistency. The issue cannot and must not be to regulate arms competition in space and on earth  but to end it.Where the arms race has not yet started it must not be allowed to occur  and where there already exist immense stockpiles of weapons  the arms spiral must be vigorously reversed. This is how the German Democratic Republic sees the aim and object of the Soviet-United States negotiations about nuclear and space weapons.The German Democratic Republic welcomes and supports the great number of unilateral pledges made by the Soviet Union  the aim of which is to stop the arms race and facilitate the transition to nuclear disarmament. These pledges clearly underscore the Soviet Union's will to contribute to the success of the Geneva talks. The peoples expect that the other side will take a similarly constructive position.A few weeks ago we observed the fortieth anniversary of the day when atomic bombs were first used to destroy two Japanese cities and their populations. That date marks one of the darkest chapters in the history of human civilization.In our time  when fewer and fewer people know the horrors of war from their own experience  the memory of that day  6 August 1945  should be kept alive and remind all of us to redouble our efforts to avert a worldwide nuclear catastrophe. Every State without exception can and must do its part.We reiterate the demand to pave the way towards ending the nuclear arms race and towards nuclear disarmament through  first  a pledge by all nuclear-weapon States to forgo the first use of nuclear arms  as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have already undertaken; secondly  through a freeze on existing nuclear arsenals; and  thirdly  through an immediate  complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests.The Soviet initiative for the unilateral renunciation of all nuclear explosions and for an extension of the moratorium beyond 1 January 1986  provided the United States joins in  holds out new hopes and vistas for the peoples. The rejection to this date of this Soviet peace move also must not be the last word spoken by the United States.At the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  negotiations on the prevention of an arms race in outer space  the avoidance of nuclear war  a complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests and nuclear disarmament should commence without delay  and the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons  which have now been going on for over 13 years  should be finally brought to a successful conclusion. For  next to nuclear weapons  chemical weapons are the most dangerous means of mass destruction. The German Democratic Republic wants to see such weapons prohibited throughout the world. Regional accords could expedite this process. The proposals for such a regional accord which the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic have addressed to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany are inspired by their intention to fulfill their responsibility for peace and the relaxation of tensions in Central Europe and to meet the security interests of their own and  indeed  of all European peoples through a joint contribution to arms limitation and disarmament. The response which this initiative has so far found is an encouragement to keep to that path  thus strengthening confidence and security.This approach also guides the German Democratic Republic in regard to the continuation of the process ushered in by the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which has become indispensable  especially today.The German Democratic Republic strongly favors nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Balkans and in Northern Europe. It renews its readiness  recorded in connection with the Swedish initiative concerning the creation of a zone free of battlefield nuclear weapons in Central Europe  to make its entire territory available for inclusion in such a zone.Efforts made with a view to enhancing security in other regions of the world through effective measures of limiting military activities and promoting disarmament are whole-heartedly backed by my country. This is true  in particular  of the efforts which have been made for years to convene an international conference on the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. We therefore welcome the agreement recently reached by the States of the South Pacific region to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that area as an expression of the efforts being made to create a world without nuclear weapons.It is becoming increasingly evident that super-armament is the principal obstacle to social security and economic advance. The relationship between disarmament and development is obvious.We know that while world arms expenditure is approaching the $1 000 billion threshold  in many developing countries almost half of the children die  before they reach the age of five  of malnutrition or because of the lack of medical care. A mere fraction of military spending in the world would suffice to reach the objective of health for all.Permit me to recall that back in 1974 the World Health Organization launched an appeal for an international campaign for immunization of all the children of the world by 1990. The German Democratic Republic  where vaccinations are part and parcel of basic medical schemes  provides substantial assistance to quite a few developing countries in carrying out their respective programs and other related measures for the preservation of international peace. International economic relations based on equal rights are becoming increasingly important.They can flourish only in conditions of sovereign equality. That is why the German Democratic Republic stands in solidarity at the side of the developing countries.Many developing countries are suffering from the disastrous impact of the persistent monetary and financial crisis in the capitalist world  which is due to a policy of high interest rates and the diversion of capital to finance the course of super-armament. We approve of the proposal made by the non-aligned States to convene an international conference on money and finance  with universal participation  within the United Nations framework.Faithful to its foreign policy principles  the German Democratic Republic continues to offer undiminished solidarity and support to developing countries.In 1984  its assistance amounted to some 2 billion marks  which is equivalent to 0.82 per cent of the national income produced in that year and represents an increase of 9.5 per cent over the previous year.Peace and security are inconceivable without national and social liberation of the peoples. The liberated States and peoples have joined the broad stream of the fighters for peace  disarmament and social progress  as is evident in particular by the Delhi Declaration  which calls for the prevention of nuclear war and a return to detente.The German Democratic Republic most strongly condemns the State terrorism of the apartheid regime in South Africa  which over the past few weeks has greatly escalated violent repression internally and the use of force externally. We are in favor of effective sanctions which would help to ensure respect for human rights in South Africa. Bogus sanctions do not change anything. Since apartheid cannot be reformed  it must be abolished. The German Democratic Republic reaffirms its unqualified solidarity with the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and with all patriots in South Africa and Namibia. It strongly condemns South Africa's continued policy of aggression pursued against the People's Republic of Angola.The German Democratic Republic calls for the granting of independence to Namibia on the basis of the relevant United Nations decisions  including Security Council resolution 435 (1978).There is urgent need for a peaceful settlement in Central America  where the situation is worsening in the wake of policies of military and economic threat and blackmail. A settlement can be achieved provided there is strict respect for the peoples' right to self-determination  for sovereignty and the principles of non-interference and  above all  of the inadmissibility of the threat or use of force. The German Democratic Republic endorses the efforts made by the Contadora Group and the policy pursued by Nicaragua? which are aimed at a peaceful settlement of the conflict.We extend our sympathy and support to Cyprus in its just struggle for national independence and a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of the pertinent United Nations resolutions.The persistent dangerous situation in the Middle East gives rise to great concern. A just and durable peace in that area can be reached only through the complete withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  by recognition of the legitimate national right of the Palestinian people to create an independent State of its own and by ensuring the sovereignty and security of all the States concerned.The German Democratic Republic favors the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The German Democratic Republic reaffirms its solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which seeks a settlement of the existing problems by way of negotiation. The security of that region requires the definitive cessation of interference .in internal affairs and the ending of the undeclared war of imperialist reactionary forces.My country follows with sympathy the efforts made by the States of IndoChina to establish lasting peace and stability in South-East Asia based on dialog and co-operation. The political and military measures agreed upon last August by the Foreign Ministers of the countries of IndoChina are of far-reaching importance. The demand of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of United States forces from South Korea is considered by the German DemocraticRepublic to be both justified and an important prerequisite for a peaceful settlement of the contentious issues on the Korean peninsula and the peaceful unification of Korea without outside interference. The pertinent resolution adopted here 10 years ago  of which the German Democratic Republic was a co-sponsor  offers a realistic basis and remains valid. The preservation of peace is the overriding obligation of the present time  as is borne out by the mounting tensions and conflicts in various regions of the world. The German Democratic Republic has therefore complied whole-heartedly with the United Nations recommendation to declare 1986 the International Year of Peace.Like other countries  it holds that the alarming trends in international relations can be reversed provided common sense and realism prevail all over the world. When all partisans of poMce join together in resolute action  paths will be found along which to proceed to arms limitation and disarmament  political dialog between States with different social systems will enhance the indispensable confidence among States  businesslike negotiations and compromises will become possible and mutual understanding and co-operation will finally be promoted  leaving the ground for confrontation and arms build-up.Such action would be a fitting tribute to the more than 50 million dead of the last world war.Today  the United Nations is faced with decisions which have implications reaching far beyond the year 2000. Never before in history have the living generations had so heavy a responsibility to the generations to come. Eithermankind will move ever closer to self-destruction or it will put an end to the stockpiling of ever more destructive weapons systems and dismantle the arsenals of death.The experience of the past and the challenges of the present demand  in the interests of life  that we carefully preserve and gradually build on what has been so hard to achieve. Let us join together in combating war before the weapons speak. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is a worthy occasion for the German Democratic Republic solemnly to renew its commitment to the aims of this forum of world peace."
"36",1846,"DEU",40,1985,"Let me offer you my congratulations. Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly  in this jubilee year your long diplomatic experience with the United Nations will be of inestimable assistance to us.Let me offer my thanks also to Ambassador Paul Lusaka for his successful work as President of the thirty-ninth session. He helped to ensure that during the last session of the General Assembly the major problems of Africa were dealt with pragmatically  realistically and in a genuinely sympathetic spirit.Forty years ago  in founding the United Nations  the nations learned the lessons of the Second World War. The Federal Republic of Germany  though not a founding Member of the United Nations  has always  since it was constituted  worked for the fulfillment of the United Nations mission to preserve world peace. We do this by means of our policies in pursuit of peace in Europe and throughout the world.For 40 years Europe has lived without war. In the North Atlantic Alliance  to which the Federal Republic of Germany as a liberal democracy has firmly hitched its destiny  a community of States was established which is a model of peaceful co-operation on a basis of equality and makes a contribution to peace and stability beyond its own frontiers.In the European Community  friendship and co-operation have taken the place of centuries of rivalry and confrontation. From the original Community of six States the present Community has developed with its 10 members  and there will soon be 12 members. The forthcoming accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community will bring great enrichment and new strength to the liberally and democratically constituted States of Europe. We want to put closer common foreign and security policies on a contractual basis. The way to European union is signposted. We regard an active policy in pursuit of peace as a historical duty to our own continent and to the world.Europe is more than the States of the European Community. When we speak of Europe  we mean the whole of Europe. Peace in the world is particularly dependent on the relations between West and East in Europe. Through the partition of Europe  the German nation was torn apart. Tension between West and East affects us most acutely. For us  therefore  a policy on Germany is a policy in search of peace in Europe and a policy in the spirit of the United Nations. It is not possible to secure peace in Europe without a contribution by both German States. War must never again emanate from German soil. Joint efforts for peace are imperative. That is the essence of the community of responsibility in which both German States fulfill their special mission and duty to ensure peace. Our co-operation merits the support of all States sincerely interested in stability and genuine detente at the heart of Europe.It is encouraging that on 12 March 1985 Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  jointly recognized the opportunity for a new phase of West-East relations presented by the resumption of the arms control dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Federal Republic of Germany will do everything in its power to help improve relations between West and East. The treaties concluded during the seventies by the Federal Republic of Germany with its neighbors continue to be a solid basis for such improvement. The starting point was the 1970 Treaty ofMoscow  which put relations between the Federal Republic of Germany an<5 the Soviet Union on a new footing. Through the Treaty of Moscow and the treaties with the People's Republic of Poland and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  as well as the Treaty on the Basis of Relations with the German Democratic Republic  we opened up out of a national and historical responsibility for peace  new long-term prospects for relations between West and East. We stand by these treaties. Our contractualpolicy is not inconsistent with the political aim of the Federal Republic of Germany to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination. That is the wording of the ""Letter on German Unity"" handed over by the Federal Government to the Soviet sideon the occasion of the signing of the Treaty of Moscow. These treaties and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin cleared the way for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).On 1 August 1985  at the meeting marking the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act  all participating States affirmed their determination to continue the CSCE process and to implement all parts of the Helsinki Final Act. This Final Act is a realistic and balanced document. It is not a peace treaty but sets the course towards a future peaceful order in Europe. The CSCE process is intended to combine the precepts of peaceful coexistence between States and a wide range of co-operative options  on the one hand  with respect for the fundamental rights and interests of people regarding exchanges and information  on the other. It has encouraged States to pool their resources and creative powers. Co-operation is intended to check and reduce the potential for conflict inherent in the existing clashes of interests and differences between systems of values. The opportunities offered by international co-operation will become even more important in the light of the dawning technological revolution. A robust and enduring peaceful order that takes account of the legitimate interests of all concerned must be based on efforts to build confidence and establish co-operative security  combined with the participation of all in economic  scientific and technological progress. Cultural exchanges play a particularly important role in the creation of such an order.Free and creative contacts and exchanges among all nations and presentation of cultural achievements on a reciprocal basis impart knowledge and deepen understanding of one another. In Europe the joint cultural heritage has always remained a unifying bond in spite of horrific wars  a bond transcending ideological frontiers.Awareness of the cultural identity of Europe is growing  as is the realization on all sides that Europe will continue in future to have a common fate. The Cultural Forum to take place shortly in Budapest within the CSCE process will give all participating States the chance to substantiate their desire for cultural co-operation and exchanges.The network of diverse connections developed between West and East in Europe has stood up in past years to serious strains. Our aim now must be to reach more extensive  more comprehensive results than in the seventies. The sound beginnings made in those days must be exploited.We welcome the forthcoming summit meeting between the President of the United States and the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. The Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl  has repeatedly advocated such a summit meeting. The meeting in Geneva is intended to become the new beginning of a top-level dialog. Above all  we hope for a significant impetus to the negotiations in Geneva.On 8 January 1985 the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to resume negotiations. They began on 12 March. The document of 8 January is of great political importance. It creates new opportunities for arms control  dialog and co-operation within the West-East relationship. Far-reaching negotiating objectives are laid down in the document: to prevent an arms race in space and to terminate it on Earth? to reach effective agreements to limit and reduce nuclear weapons  both intercontinental and intermediate-range; and to strengthen strategic stability. The Federal Government unreservedly supports those negotiating objectives. They are in the interests of all nations.We are well aware that results take time. The subjects under negotiation are intricate and complex. Each side must heed the security interests of the other. Tension and distrust must be reduced. Success depends on the negotiating parties endeavoring seriously and flexibly to reach co-operative solutions. They must consider themselves responsible for a common task. In the relations between West and East  no side must try to achieve a level of security that means less security for the other side.Developments in the balance of military power between West and East since the 1970s are drastic evidence of that fact. The massive arms build-up by which the West has increasingly felt threatened since the period of detente in the 1970s has brought no major advantage to its originators; on the contrary  it has promoted the search for new types of space-based defensive options. Drastic and reliably verifiable reductions in nuclear offensive potential will therefore necessarily influence the need for  and the scope of  future defensive weapons. Both questions must be considered and resolved in their natural and political interrelationship  as was agreed on 8 January 1985.The efforts to .achieve co-operative security are a key to the development of a stable relationship between West and East  on which world peace is largely dependent. If success is to be achieved during the present negotiations  existing arms control arrangements must be adhered to. The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes the decision made by President Reagan regarding continued observance of the SALT limitations. Co-operative solutions to the central security issues require a political environment marked by a minimum of mutual trust. A particularly important factor in that trust is predictability of the long-term intentions of the other side. That is why a sound and constructive relationship between the super-Powers is indispensable. But confidence-building and arms control are not a matter for the super-Powers alone: the medium-sized and small States  too  must endeavor to establish an enduring  stable basis for West-East relations. Distrust must be reduced wherever it exists.Not only nuclear weapons  but also the other potential weapons must be reduced. That is why the multilateral negotiating forums remain for us indispensable components of the arms-control process.It is an encouraging sign that the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has had a successful outcome. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has proved its worth as an important element of international arms control and of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It has shown that multilateral arms control is possible.The mutual and balanced force reduction negotiations in Vienna and the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe concentrate on conventional forces and are an essential complement to the nuclear negotiations in Geneva. The aims of those negotiations  too  are stability at a low level of .forces  openness  transparency  predictability and the renunciation of force by means of specific confidence-building measures. Here in New York we launched an initiative aimed at drawing up guidelines for confidence-building measures that could be applied throughout the world.Without reliable verification  arms-control agreements would be built on shaky foundations. The attempt to establish a universal prohibition of chemical weapons is still being hampered by the outstanding verification issues  which must now be tackled with vigor. It is high time that an end was put to the scourge for mankind constituted by those chemical weapons of mass destruction that have been outlawed for decades. Partial  regional solutions do not achieve that. They would make the question of verification even more complex. However  we welcome every effort by other States to bring about reliable verifiability. In that spirit  we are studying the suggestions made to us by the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The States at the heart of Europe have every reason to help resolve the verification question  thereby ensuring that chemical weapons are banned worldwide.We know that a state of non-war through nuclear deterrence cannot be the ultimate method of securing peace. If deterrence against attack  deterrence against war - in other words the strategy of preventing war - should ever fail  there would be inconceivable consequences. The fortieth anniversary of Hiroshima renewed our awareness of that truth. In the nuclear age security can no longer be based solely on autonomous efforts. The long-term preservation of peace  however requires co-operative solutions; for that reason  disarmament and arms control are integral components of our security policy. We want to avoid any type of war  including war waged without nuclear weapons.No one must reserve the option to make the first use of conventional weapons. Given the present state of technology  a conventional war would be a thousand times more dreadful than the Second World War. In Europe  with its high levels of armaments  even a conventional war would be a catastrophe. Our Alliance has declared that it will never be the first to use arms. We do not seek superiority. We do not wish to defeat or control anyone  nor do we wish to make any side arm itself to exhaustion.The many trouble-spots in the world  the regional conflicts  must not be seen only from a European point of view; above all  they must not be fitted into the mold of the West-East confrontation. That is why we regard genuine non-alignment of the States in the Third World as a tremendously important contribution to world peace and to the realization of the purposes of the United Nations. The great idea of equal rights and self-determination of peoples must not remain empty words. Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations makes it clear that all nations possess the same right to determine their own national life and political actions  including the political pursuit of peace. That right entails respect for the special needs of peoples in their own regions. No State and no power bloc has the right  or can usurp the right  to decide on issues vital to other nations.We  along with the vast majority of the United Nations  therefore demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Striving for ideological supremacy means rejecting real non-alignment. That was recognized with the utmost clarity at the summit conferences of the non-aligned countries in Havana and New Delhi and most recently at the Foreign Ministers Conference in Luanda. Real solutions to the problems of the third world must come from the regions in question.The European Community  our regional Community  is also an attempt to solve regional problems by means of an increasingly close association of the European democracies. Together with our European partners  we support regional co-operation and associations of States in all other parts of the world too. We actively support the peaceful settlement of conflicts among neighbors. That helps to keep East-^West confrontation out of the third world.On the basis of this concept of regional co-operation  we support the Contadora process in Central America  a process initiated in the region itself. It is the only realistic way for Central Timerica to approach the solution of its problems. In Luxembourg  on 11 and 12 November  another conference is to take place between the Foreign Ministers of the European Community  Spain and Portugal and those of the Central American States and the Contadora group. We want to continue the dialog between the two regions of Central America and Europe; we seek close co-operation between them.We also seek structured economic and political co-operation between the European Community and the Gulf Co-operation Council. In the Middle East we support regional efforts to increase the willingness of all parties to the conflict to negotiate and bring about peace. We acknowledge the positive elements of the Fez plan. We welcome the initiative of King Hussein and hope that it will help pave the way towards negotiations. Only through negotiations and the renunciationof force can accommodation be found between the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.We support the regional efforts for peace of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The European Community recognized from the very beginning that the economic and political co-operation pursued by the ASEAN States was an exemplary form of regional co-operation that pointed the way ahead. The ASEAN countries' Kampuchea initiative in the United Nations can count on our vote.We are pleased that talks have been resumed between the two parts of Korea. We support all efforts to eliminate tension on the Korean peninsula. That should also open the way for accession to the United Nations.To work for peace in the world also means to co-operate in order to meet together the economic and social challenges faced by mankind. North and South must co-operate to bring about successful development in the third world. North and South must also co-operate to come to terms with the global structural transformation that the third industrial revolution will cause once the transition has been made to the age of information and communication technology. This new age offers great opportunities to mankind. It will enable the world to grow even closer together and will extend the scope and the need for international co-operation. It will open up new opportunities for the individual responsibility and personal development of everyone.The one world in which we live today cannot remain a peaceful world for long if it remains divided into rich and poor nations  into technically advanced and technically backward nations. The establishment of a truly peaceful world means overcoming hunger and poverty in all regions of the world.Our look back at 40 years of the United nations is also a look back at 40 years of development co-operation. Despite all the problems that remain unsolved  the last 40 years have been a period of unprecedented economic growth  particularly for the third world. The gross national product in Asia  Africa and Latin America grew by 5.6 per cent annually during the 30 years from 1950 to 1980; that means that it increased fivefold. Between 1960 and 1982 life expectancy rose from an average of 42 to 49 years; infant mortality was cut in half; and whereas in 1960 only 50 per cent of the children received primary education  94 per cent receive it now.Two central themes of this sessions of the General Assembly are the debt crisis and the situation in Africa. Since 1982 we have made progress towards overcoming the debt crisis  but the crisis is far from having been mastered. It continues to tick like a time-bomb in the world economy and jeopardizes the growth and social stability of the developing countries  as well as the health of the banking system in the industrialized countries. What can be done?First of all  we must find methods for restoring credit flows to a normal level and for enabling adequate resources to flow into the developing countries. However  the very volume of such funds means that this task cannot be fulfilled by the international financial institutions alone  nor even principally by them. Private banks and investors must continue to play the main role. I appeal to the commercial banks not to shirk this responsibility. For their part  the debtor countries must also make every possible effort during the coming years to reform their internal economic policies and to fight inflation. Only in that way can they strengthen their international creditworthiness  create a favorable climate for investment and terminate the flight of capital. He must  however  be aware also of the fact that the debt issue is not only an economic and financialissue; it is also a political question. It is a question of the social peace and internal stability of the debtor countries. They must not be confronted with impossible demands. The servicing of foreign debt must not be paid for in the third world with recession  unemployment and hunger  or with a threat to freedom  democracy and independence.Secondly  if the debt crisis is to be resolved  further interest-rate reductions are required. The industrialized countries must pursue an economic and financial policy that enables interest rates to be reduced further. They must reduce their budget deficits.Thirdly  the markets of the industrialized countries must remain open to developing countries; they must be opened even wider. Protectionism is a danger not only in economic growth in the industrialized countries; protectionism is a deadly danger to the developing countries. Free world trade is of vital importance to the developing countries. Only if the industrialized countries open up their markets to exports of finished and semi-finished products from the developing countries can the latter be more firmly integrated into the world economy  whoever denies the third world access to its markets is denying it development. The Federal Republic of Germany supports open markets  particularly with regard to the third world. The high trading surpluses on our market  particularly those of the African and Latin American countries  bear witness to that fact. So that free trade can be secured and consolidated  we advocate that the next round of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) be commenced as soon as possible. The acute danger to international free trade stems particularly from the great trade imbalances in the world. It would however be a fateful mistake to seek to overcome them by means of trade barriers. It would mean misunderstanding the roots of the problem.An interdependent world economy does not permit any isolationist economic policies pursued with no regard to their effects on other countries. The stronger the economy of a country  the greater its responsibility.The call to open up markets to the third world is also addressed to the socialist industrialized countries. They still continue to take less than 5 per cent of the finished products exported by the third world. That is in no way compatible with their international economic position and the responsibility that they also bear.The second great task facing us at this session of the General Assembly is that of aid for Africa. After the last session of the General Assembly  the international community organized assistance to combat the threat of starvation. The Federal Government helped with food  transport and medicines. Innumerable people in my country gave generous donations. Assistance for Africa must continue and  indeed  be increased. Donors and recipients are agreed that external help alone cannot bring about the breakthrough. Africa knows that it needs economic reforms and that it must make agriculture the focal point of its development efforts. Good producer prices are essential as an incentive to farmers to increase production  but the reforms in Africa can be implemented only if they are supported by adequate help from outside. Acting on a mandate from the Bonn Economic Summit  the seven industrialized States represented there prepared proposals for the fight against hunger in Africa which were approved here in New York yesterday by the seven Foreign Ministers.The Federal Republic of Germany regards development policy as part of its policy in pursuit of peace. We want the developing countries to become economically more self-sufficient and independent. We want to strengthen the economic foundations of genuine non-alignment. The Federal Republic of Germany has not concentrated its assistance on a few selected countries; on the contrary  wehave helped wherever the need was greatest. We have remitted the debt of the world's poorest countries to an extent unequaled by any other industrialized country.The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany considers population policy to be a necessary component of a successful development strategy. We therefore also support the United Nations Population Fund. It has performed valuable work and played a considerable part in slowing down the rate of population growth. However  further successes are needed.Worldwide interdependence is particularly clearly illustrated in the field of environmental protection. In that field ""international home affairs"" are becoming an element of international policy  and in that field mankind is making collective decisions regarding its own future. Our forests are in danger. Our agricultural land is being eroded; deserts and steppes are spreading; seas  lakes and rivers are becoming increasingly polluted; animal and plant species are becoming extinct. It is vital to preserve the natural sources of life on which we all together depend on the shrinking planet Earth.In the field of North-South co-operation it is vital to begin dealing in good time with the questions raised by the new forms of technology  microelectronics and bioengineering. These forms of technology present great opportunities  particularly for the developing countries. Gene technology offers great potential for a solution to the world food problem. The new telecommunications and radio satellites offer the opportunity to equip entire regions of the third world quickly and relatively cheaply with a communications infrastructure. However  the opportunities are accompanied by risks. For instance  the new forms of information technology in the industrialized countries are accelerating automation. This posesthe danger to the developing countries that the advantage they derive from lower labor costs will be eroded. North and South must co-operation to take the opportunities offered to the third world by these new forms of technology and to avert dangers. What seems to me to be the greatest opportunity is  that the new technological revolution will permit many developing countries  at least in some sectors  to enter the new information age at practically the same time as the industrialized nations.The United Nations has recognized the dignity of man as the supreme principle. All States must follow this principle at home and in their foreign relations. The United Nations has created a comprehensive system of universally binding standards to protect human rights. The 1984 Convention against Torture is a document directed against humiliation  inhumanity and cruelty. I hope that the next agreement in this sphere will be a further optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty. We are faced with the task of putting human rights not only into words but a.J.so into practice. For this  we need international institutions that strengthen the protection of human rights. We call for the appointment of a high commissioner for human rights and for the creation of an international court of human rights at the United Nations.In many parts of the world human rights are still violated. One special human-rights problem that depresses us all is that of apartheid in South Africa. We seek the peaceful elimination of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. That is consistent with the ethical basis of our constitution  with the demands of the Christian churches and with the deep conviction of the people of my country. At issue are equal rights for all South Africans  irrespective of the color of their skin. The world watches with horror and outrage the escalation of the bloody clashes in South Africa. We appeal to the responsible authorities in South Africa to release each and every political prisoner  to end forced resettlement  to put a stop to arbitrary detention without trial and to terminate the state of emergency. Only in negotiators with the authentic leaders of all groups of the population can a permanent solution be found. The form that solution will take must be decided by the people in South Africa themselves; no one outside South Africa has the right to lay down how this should be done. The South African Government has recently given indications of specific reforms. These must now be implemented quickly. Further  increasingly extensive reforms are essential  until apartheid has been fully eliminated. We hope that the responsible leaders do not miss the last opportunity given them by history.The right of peoples to self-determination must be the basis of the solution to the question of Namibia. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains for us the indispensable basis for any Namibian solution. We appeal to the Government of South Africa to make the way clear at last for the internationally recognized independence of Namibia. It is free elections that must decide which Government the majority of the people wishes.The United Nations is 40 years old. This year  we shall rededicate ourselves solemnly to the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar has called on us to pursue a new co-operative internationalism. We support his practical proposals. We do not need a new Charter  but we do need a new spirit in the United Nations. It is here  it is in this building  that the preservation of peace must begin. The United Nations was created to reconcile differing interests. It must not be abused for propaganda and for short-term voting successes  useful as they may be for domestic political purposes and votes. To be sure  the United Nations is a political Organization  and politics means struggles over power  influence  values  programs and personalities. And yet we must not forget that the United Nations is a precious instrument in our hands. Our war-scarred fathers have created it. We still have to learn to make the best possible use of the instrument offered us by the United Nations for the preservation of peace. History will not judge us by occasionally small tactical successes; it will judge us solely by whether we succeeded in avoiding the final catastrophe and enhancing the human dignity of all mankind. The dignity of man  his inalienable and fundamental rights  must remain the yardstick against which all our actions are measured."
"37",1884,"DJI",40,1985,"Tunisia  a friendly sister State  has just fallen victim to a criminal aggression by the Zionist entity which has claimed More than 100 innocent victims. This state terrorism demonstrates - if there were any need for further demonstration - the barbarous intent pursued by Israel in this part of the world in contempt of the purposes and principles of the united Nations. The international community must firmly condemn this criminal act carried out by Israel against a sovereign State.This deliberate act by the Zionist entity  at the very moment when the international community is meeting in this Assembly to find an equitable solution to the painful problem of the Middle Bast  is intended only to hinder the efforts made to establish peace in that part of the world.The Republic of Djibouti considers that this criminal act is not only directed against Tunisia and Palestine but against the entire Arab nation.On behalf of the Government and people of Djibouti  we firmly condemn this criminal act and assure our brother Arab peoples of Palestine and Tunisia of our complete solidarity.Allow me to express  Sir  our deepest sympathy  on behalf of the people and Government of Djibouti  to the brother people of Mexico  after the earthquake which has caused that country such grief. We assure them of our complete solidarity in the face of this disaster.Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation  and on my own personal behalf  allow me to congratulate Ambassador de Piniés of Spain on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. His election to this post of great responsibility is an honor both to his country and to his qualities as an experienced diplomat. Wis competence and long experience in this organization will surely permit him to ensure that the deliberations of this important session are successful. My delegation always stands ready to offer him its active help and co-operation in carrying out the heavy responsibilities which have been entrusted to him.Allow me also to express the appreciation and gratitude of my delegation to Ambassador de Pinies' predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  who throughout his presidency displayed exemplary competence and devotion.I should also like at this time to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the efforts he is making in the search for international peace and co-operation and for his commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.The fortieth session of the General Assembly is of particular interest to the international community. This important session is filled  in our eyes  with great hopes and aspirations with regard to better human interaction and mankind's chance for survival. We are happy to seize the occasion of this special event to reflect together on our past experiences and to exchange views on the problems of the moment  whose solutions are so crucial to the maintenance of international peace and security.We are convinced that the United Nations has always provided the best forum for seeking better understanding in international relations  in this spirit my delegation  committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  has joined its voice with those of other nations in expressing its willingness to cooperate.At this General Assembly we are compelled to express our concern over the economic  social and political crises taking place all over the world. The international economic crisis continues to worsen  and is causing disturbing imbalance  especially in the developing countries.Consequently the international community has had to turn its attention to this problem. Yet the problem of restructuring existing international economic relations in order to establish a new international economic order remains unchanged. The international community should therefore make an effort to dredge up the will necessary to overcome inertia and the lack of enthusiasm so evident in the negotiations between the developed and the developing nations. It should also create the necessary climate of mutual understanding and political will for reaching agreement in the areas which are of concern to the nations of the world.The developing countries have suffered an extreme deterioration in their economic conditions since the beginning of the 1970s. This is due in particular to the drop in the prices of raw materials  to the increase in interest rates  to the growth in their external debt and to the protectionist policies of the developed countries. Many African countries - including my own - are faced with problems of indebtedness  and have been forced to adopt rigorous austerity measures  which have created critical economic and social conditions which are dramatically curbing their development.The tragic situation of the African countries because of the world economic crisis has become a source of great concern in the United Nations and in other international bodies. We welcome the laudable efforts of the Secretary-General to seek effective and appropriate solutions to solve the present economic difficulties in Africa. We express our appreciation and gratitude to the international community for the special attention it has given to the critical economic situation in Africa.For over 20 years the African continent has undergone climatic changes resulting in unprecedented drought no desertification. That has dealt a heavy blow to the countries in the Sudano-Sahelian region  in East Africa and in southern Africa. Drought and desertification continue thus diminishing food production  destroying the means of subsistence of Billions of people end threatening millions of others with famine and total deprivation. The magnitude and gravity of the crisis led the East African countries to sake joint efforts to face this drought and its disastrous consequences.Hence  six countries in the subregion - Ethiopia  Kenya  Uganda  Somalia  Sudan and Djibouti- decided in keeping with the provisions of Resolution 35/90 of theGeneral Assembly and in keeping with the provisions of other subsequent resolutions  to establish an intergovernmental body to combat the effects of drought and other natural disasters related to it. To do so  the Ministers of these countries  having finished their consultations in this regard in New York in October 1984  met in Djibouti last February for a subregional conference on drought and development. At that conference  the Ministers reaffirmed their common will to join their efforts to combat the effects of drought and to do so within the framework of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) in East Africa.A second ministerial meeting was held last May in Djibouti during which the basic documents for the establishment of IGADD were adopted. The six countries of the subregion will hold another ministerial session next October and November to complete and to adopt a plan of action and to initial the basic texts for IGADD. The final signature of these documents will take place at the summit meeting of Heads of State and Government of those countries  planned for January 1986 in Djibouti. I should like here  in my capacity as Minister for Co-ordination of that body  to express my special gratitude to the United Nations Development Program and to the United Nations Office for the Sudano-Sahelian Region for the help they have given us in setting up this organization. I should also like to take this opportunity to make an urgent appeal to the Members of this Assembly and to international organizations and institutions to provide the financial  material and technical assistance which is needed by IGADD in order to be able to carry out the task for which it was created.The Republic of Djibouti is in a precarious economic and financial position. This is characterized by the absence of agricultural and industrial activities  by a lack of natural resources and of skilled professional manpower. This situation has been worsened by the considerable presence of refugees and by the effects still felt from the devastating drought in the region.The Republic of Djibouti  one of the least developed countries  does not have the necessary monetary  financial and technical means to bear the heavy burden of its own economic development without help from outside. In this regard  we need -as do numerous developing countries - substantial help to construct the bases necessary for the economic development process in my country.The Palestinian question continues to offer the most serious challenge to the credibility of the United Nations. Unlike other problems of concern to the international community  the Palestinian problem was created in this Assembly and for that reason the United Nations has a moral and political obligation to find a just and lasting solution to it.As the United Nations celebrates this year the fortieth anniversary of its establishment  it should take this opportunity to evaluate its activities over the last 40 years. Similarly  the United Nations should also evaluate the situation of the Palestinian people as it has evolved since the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 181 (XI)   in which it foresaw the creation of a Palestinian Arab State. We believe that this resolution is just as relevant today as it was in 1947  because it is based on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. All of us know that the disturbances and the conflicts which have occurred in the Middle Bast since 194U stem directly from the refusal to allow the Palestinian people to exercise their fundamental tights. During these last 40 years  the Arab nation has undergone four devastating wars which have threatened international peace and security. Such conflicts are inevitable each and every time fundamental human rights are violated.An unrelenting war continual without respite in the Middle Bast  a war less evident but none the lens more radical than the other wars which have ravaged that part of the world  and that is the war of settlements  whose purpose is to uproot the Palestinians from their ancestral homeland  to strip then of their cultural and national identity and to alter their history.Hy delegation does not intend to present a report on the situation in the occupied territories. The detailed information published by the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories reveals the conditions which prevail in those territories.The Zionist settlement policy is the negation of the existence of the Arab population which has possessed that land since the time immemorial. This policy is an obstacle to every effort at peace based on justice and legality. Therefore the first stage towards a real global peace in the Middle Hast would be to end Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab territories  and that includes the Holy City of Jerusalem.As I have mentioned above  United Nations has a special responsibility to the Palestinian people and we are convinced that the United Notions is the most appropriate place to discuss and to settle the Palestinian question. He believe than any international conference on Palestine Bust bring together all the parties concerned on an equal basis  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) which is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The Fez summit peace plan has already demonstrated the sincere desire of the Arab nations for a real and lasting peace in the Middle East. However  we welcome any other initiative which would lead to a global  lasting peace and which would allow the Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable right to establish an independent state on their national soil  because without the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people peace and stability in the Middle East will continue to be illusory.For the last six years  violence has become a daily experience in Lebanon. The fratricidal struggles ravaging that country for the last six years have brought grief to innumerable families and caused great destruction. This alarming situation was worsened in 1982 by the Israeli invasion  and Lebanon is still suffering the consequences of that invasion. Today  Lebanon needs international solidarity which would guarantee its sovereignty and territorial integrity and help it to restore its national unity. We sincerely hope to see Lebanon regain the security and the peaceful and prosperous life which it had in the past.An explosive situation reigns throughout southern Africa  where the racist regime of Pretoria is carrying out repeated aggressions against the front-line States. Indeed  Angola has just experienced further barbarous criminal attacks by the racist regime of Pretoria.That regime is continuing its unceasing attacks in order to intimidate the African countries which make up the front-line States  those which support the peoples of South Africa and of Namibia in their attempts to regain their freedom. The criminal act carried out today against Angola and yesterday against Botswana by the racist regime in Pretoria testifies once again to the seriousness of the situation in South Africa. These aggressions are a threat to international peace and security.We want the United Nations and in particular the Security Council to taHe appropriate measures under Chapter VII of the Charter so that the uninterrupted aggressions of South Africa against sovereign neighboring States will cease.?he situation in South Africa is tragic. The South African majority is subject to the harsh system of apartheid and its rights and fundamental freedoms are trampled upon. The South African regime in pursuing these harmful goals  recently imposed the state of emergency in the country  thus creating an unprecedented climate of terror. That was followed by n outbreak of violence which has extended to numerous black townships and continues to grow at an alarming rate.The brutality of the police forces which transform peaceful strikes by various sectors of the African society into blood baths  has already caused the death of thousands of innocent people. In spite of this horror we are sure that this flagrant campaign of intimidation and harassment against miners and the raids by the police forces in different cities and townships  and mass arrests  all are dangerous tactics which are doomed  however  to failure.While the international community has condemned apartheid as being a crime against mankind  it is high time for the international community to mobilize Its forces to eliminate completely this heinous system and support the legitimate struggle being carried out by the South African people to dismantle apartheid and to establish 3 democratic society.We hope that recent events in South Africa will lead the international community to exert effective pressure on the Pretoria regime to compel it to lift the state of emergency  free the political prisoners and detainees  and recognize the fundamental rights of the black majority.International action against apartheid should seriously consider military and economic sanctions which could lead to disinvestment and to a complete embargo especially with regard to the acquisition of nuclear-weapon capability. Indeed  we believe that any economic and military collaboration with south Africa can do nothing but increase the aggressive capacity of the racist regime in Pretoria and lead it to further intensify its repression against the oppressed African majority in South Africa and Namibia. We repeat once again that international condemnation of apartheid should be reflected in active support and concrete assistance for the ongoing struggle of the liberation movements of the people of South Africa.The illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa continues. The presence of South African armed forces in Namibia  the brutal repression of the Namibian people and the constant violation of their fundamental rights must be firmly condemned. We think that any political solution of this problem must have as a pre-condition the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African occupation forces from Namibian territory so as to permit the Namibian people to exercise its inalienable right to self-determination and independence and to do so in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).The United Nations Plan for Namibia  as provided in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for a settlement of that problem. The racist regime in Pretoria  through its arrogant policy  in attempting to circumvent the United Nations Plan in order to delay the independence of Namibia. We firmly reject any attempt to delay the complete independence of Namibia  we appeal to the international community to provide generous assistance to the Namibian people and to their struggle for ligation under the direction of the South west Africa people's Organization (SWiiPO)  itu sole  authentic representative.The international community must strongly condemn the repeated acts of aggression and the continuing attacks carried out by South African armed forces against neighboring States in order to destabilize them and to prevent them from giving their support to the liberation movements.The fratricidal war going on in Chad  a war which continues to destroy intense human and material resources in that country  causes us much concern. The international community should help the people of Chad and their Government to preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity and to achieve the process of national reconciliation through peaceful means. Foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Chad  which are a flagrant violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity  must be condemned. Efforts by African States to restore peace and stability in Chad must be pursued.He cannot help but express our concern over the conflict between Iraq and Iran which has caused both countries huge losses in terms of human lives and of the destruction of their economic resources. In spite of the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  of the Non-Aligned Movement  and of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the prospects for a peaceful solution to this conflict are not very encouraging. The continuation of this conflict is exhausting not only the resources of the countries involved but is threatening peace and security in that region in particular and in the world in general.We wish to express our appreciation to the Member States of the Economic Co-operation Council of the Gulf Countries for their efforts to arrive at a peaceful solution to this fratricidal conflict. We appreciate the constructive initiative taken by the Government of Iraq for this purpose  namely  to put an end to the conflict and to start a dialog which could lead to a peaceful global settlement of the crisis. We hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement  and the Organization of the Islamic Conference will continue their efforts to end hostilities and to bring peace to the region.The genocide in Afghanistan has been going on now for six years  six of the most tragic years in the history of that country. The presence of hundreds of thousands of foreign soldiers  carrying out massacres of civilians  has forced one fourth of the population of Afghanistan to flee their homeland and to seek refuge in neighboring countries. The Afghan people have shown the world that no sacrifice is too great to preserve their independence and their cultural and spiritual values. In spite of the numerous massacres of men  women and children  the destruction of crops and entire villages  the occupation forces have not succeeded in breaking the resistance of the valiant Afghan people. The Republic of Djibouti is opposed and will always be opposed to foreign armed intervention and to the presence of occupation forces on Afghan territory or elsewhere.We sincerely hope that the negotiations between the parties concerned in the Afghan crisis will rapidly lead to a satisfactory conclusion in keeping with the provisions of the relevant United Nations resolutions to re-establish the sovereignty of Afghanistan.The Kanpuchean people have remained under foreign military occupation since 1978. In spite of the desire expressed by the immense majority of the international community  the Kampuchean situation has not been resolved. We reaffirm that it is necessary for foreign forces to withdraw from Kampuchea to create an atmosphere favorable to a political solution which would preserve the independence and restore the national sovereignty of Kampuchea  in keeping with the resolutions of the united Nations.Never before have we seen an international forum bring together so many Heads of State or Government  we hope that this fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations will provide an opportunity to draw the attention of the international community to the need for deep commitment to this Organization  in order to enhance its effectiveness in the search for international peace and security.The present session of the General Assembly should be a session of re-evaluation and reflection on ways and means of contributing to the improvement of the well-being of mankind and the maintenance of peace and stability in the world.We should be able to recall this session as an action-oriented one. It should be characterized by the emergence of a constructive dialog on ways of satisfying the pressing needs of the third-world countries in the areas of economic development and social progress. The international community should profit from this exceptional opportunity to seek solutions that will diminish world crises and settle regional and interregional conflicts. This session must also make it possible to lay the foundations for better international co-operation."
"38",1949,"DNK",40,1985,"Allow me  first of all  to offer Ambassador de Piniés my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. I assure him of the full co-operation of the Danish delegation in his performance of the duties of his high office.Next  I express the deep sorrow of my country for the victims of the earthquakes in Mexico. The tragic events caused by the earthquakes must call forth the sympathy of the international community  and I am therefore glad that the General Assembly this morning adopted by consensus an appeal calling for international relief assistance to Mexico. I assure members that my country stands ready to assist Mexico.An anniversary often provides an occasion for stock-taking. The fortieth anniversary session of the United Nations will be no exception. The anniversary celebration in October will be a more appropriate occasion to review the performance of the Organization over the past four decades and to look ahead at what should be done to improve and strengthen the United Nations in the decades to come. Consequently  I shall not make a traditional anniversary statement today.Rather  it seems to me that the main purpose of the present general debate is to provide a welcome annual opportunity to review the state of world affairs both politically and with regard to the international economic situation.The General Assembly serves to remind us of the complexity of the problems facing mankind. To a country like Denmark these problems appear first and foremost in the perspective of our own security situation viewed in the light of the overall relations between East and west.When compared to the situation prevailing last year  East-West relations of today do perhaps lend themselves to a slightly more optimistic assessment. After all  a measure of dialog has been restored between the United States and the Soviet Union. Like others  Denmark looks towards the summit meeting in November with expectation - but also with some apprehension lest the summit should fail to provide the impetus for a sustained process of dialog and confidence-building. dialog for the sake of being seen talking to - even at - each other clearly does not suffice to bring about viable solutions. A genuine willingness to concede  to compromise and to co-operate must be demonstrated at the negotiating table  not merely professed in public statements.No one can disregard the particular importance of arms control negotiations  both as an essential contribution to the current dialog and as a means of promoting stability. Arms control negotiations are important also as a process agreements or understandings already reached should be respected in order to preserve the prospects for further progress.But in addition the East-West dialog must be given a more comprehensive foundation encompassing all aspects of East-West relations. Small and medium-sized countries should also contribute towards greater confidence between East and West or at least towards a reduction of mistrust  in order that wider co-operation may be achieved. In this respect the recent commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Final Act of Helsinki highlighted the role of the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) as a basis for broad dialog between East and west in Europe.Just before the Assembly proceeded to consider the draft resolutions dealing with disarmament at last year's session of the General Assembly  the Secretary-General made a sober and thoughtful judgment. In concluding  he said: ""Many words have been spoken in the cause of disarmament. We are all aware of the goals  as outlined in the Final Document of the first special session. Only the political decisions of Governments can take us towards the realization of these goals..."". (A/39/PV.97  p. 126) The Secretary-General was pointing to the core of the matter - the necessary political will of Governments - and his words are fully shared by my Government. Disarmament is not achieved or implemented through resolutions and will come true only by political decisions.The United Nations Disarmament Commission held its annual session a few months ago. That session may serve as a sad example of what lack of political decisions can lead to. More to the regret of the Danish Government  no concrete recommendations were agreed and little  if any  progress was made.At the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  on the other hand  some progress  although modest  has been made this year. The agreement to establish an Ad Hoc Committee on Outer Space and the ongoing negotiations on a ban on chemical weapons are examples of steps in the right direction.One of the more positive experiences in the past year has been the recently finished Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear weapons. The spirit of that Conference was one of general willingness to reach a consensus  despite differing views. We hope that that preparedness by all parties to bend their views to reach common ground will have spill-over effects in other forums.The debate and the final declaration confirmed the strong commitment to the non-proliferation regime of the 130 States parties. The Non-Proliferation Treaty is an important measure in enhancing international security  which is also to the benefit of States not parties to the Treaty. In view of the important achievements in Geneva  we urge those States now to consider acceding to the Treaty.Nuclear disarmament remains an issue of the highest priority. However  conventional arms and the conventional   arms race are also a matter of great concern. The report of the Secretary-General containing the views of Member States regarding the study on conventional disarmament initiated by my country has shown that that concern is shared by a great number of countries. It is the hope of the Danish Government that the United Nations will in the future  too  give this question the full attention it deserves.In the Middle Bast  war  violence and terror reign. Indiscriminate warfare  cruelty and killing are the resort of the strong as well as of the weak. Innocent lives have been lost in peace-keeping efforts that have failed. Mediation has been frustrated.Worse yet  where is the glimmer of light that could raise hopes that the turning point might be at hand?So  everyone has failed and everyone must try to do better. The primary responsibility and opportunity lie with the parties themselves  but others can help.It is the responsibility of all of us in this Organization to work for reason  moderation  good will and justice. We must be constructive. If we base our efforts on unreliable and biased assessments we shall fail. Equally  if we choose self-righteous positions and inflammatory language we shall fail.On the premise that no one is perfectly right or perfectly just  we should in this Organization  with caution and perseverance  support those in the troubled areas who seek peace rather than those who seek victory.The situation in Lebanon is a human tragedy which has reached the point of anarchy. The Danish Government wishes to see Lebanon restored  independent  sovereign and united. We appeal to all concerned in Lebanon to bring about urgently the necessary national reconciliation.My Government urges that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) be allowed to do the job for which the United Nations has mandated it  to assist the Lebanese Government in controlling the Lebanese border area and to provide security on both sides of that border.The position of the Danish Government on the Arab-Israeli conflict  and the Palestinian problem in particular  is well known. The ongoing efforts to bring the parties concerned to direct negotiations deserve to succeed. We appeal to all parties  in the region and outside  not to jeopardize those efforts  which hold out the prospect of peace with security for all States and justice for all peoples.As to the conflict between Iran and Iraq  Denmark remains strictly impartial  but also strictly opposed to continuance of the bloody warfare. He condemn any violation of the Geneva Conventions; in particular  we condemn the use of chemical weapons and indiscriminate aerial attacks on civilians. The Danish Government calls upon both parties to settle their differences peacefully through negotiations. It commends the efforts of the Secretary-General to deescalate the warfare and bring the parties into negotiation.The misfortunes befalling the African continent call for our deepest compassion. Drought and other natural disasters have ravaged the majority of African countries  bringing in their wake untold suffering  privation and death to their peoples. Owing to a successful international relief effort  the worst of the hardships caused by natural disasters have been at least to some extent alleviated. The drought also seems to be coming to an end in many parts of Africa. However  it will be years before the affected countries have recovered fully from its effects.In South Africa  however  the situation is only deteriorating. The man-made disaster known as apartheid persists. The Pretoria regime is going to ever-greater lengths and using ever more brutal means to oppress the majority. The state of emergency declared on 20 July of this year has only made matters worse.The South African Government has so far seemed unable to realize that increased oppression will not break the will but only strengthen the resistance of the oppressed. It has given no sign of being ready to implement fundamental reforms in South Africa leading to the abolition of the apartheid system and the introduction of political and civil rights for the black majority. President Botha's speech on 15 August was yet another example of the intransigence and insensitivity to the demands for change which are presented with ever-increasing force both in South Africa and in the outside world.The Pretoria regime must realize before it is too late the need for a dialog with genuine representatives of the non-white population groups with the clearly defined goal of securing the right of proper representation for black South Africans on the national level. No just and lasting settlement will come about in South Africa unless it is based on the total eradication of the apartheid system and the establishment of a free  united and democratic society in South Africa.The Danish Government strongly believes that international pressure on the South African Government must be increased and made more effective with a view to the total abolition of the apartheid system. Denmark supports the imposition of binding economic sanctions against South Africa in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Lack of agreement among the members of the Security Council should not  however  keep individual countries or groups of countries from implementing their own measures against South Africa.To put the apartheid regime under effective economic pressure  concerted international measures adopted by the Security Council or decided by a wide group of countries  including South Africa's major trading partners  will be needed. But a range of varying measures implemented by individual countries or even by private citizens  organizations or companies will constitute significant political pressure and warning. Let us recognize every individual step as a contribution to the common effort.Unilaterally as well as with the other Nordic countries and with our partners in the European Community  Denmark has already  starting more than seven years ago  been implementing a number of concrete measures aimed at reducing our economic and other relations with south Africa. The Danish Government urges other countries to do the same. A good way to begin would be with the voluntary measures urged upon the Member States in Security Council resolution 569 (1985).Any delay in the dismantling of the apartheid system would reduce the possibilities for a peaceful solution to the conflict in South Africa and increase the risk of a far more serious and comprehensive conflict.The internal conflict in South Africa has had negative implications for the efforts to bring about the independence of Namibia. The negotiations which have gone on for so many years have ground to a halt. The Danish Government remains convinced that there is only one internationally acceptable solution to the Namibian question: the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia's transition to independence based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It sincerely hopes that progress towards such a settlement will still prove possible through a continuation of the process of dialog  which in the past has brought promising results.The international community is profoundly concerned at the situation in Afghanistan. That most unfortunate country has become a symbol  as the world witnesses the courage  dedication and determination of this traditionally neutral and non-aligned nation fighting to regain its freedom from an increasingly brutal military occupation. We appeal to the occupying Power to allow internationally recognized humanitarian relief organizations to assist those millions in Afghanistan who are innocent victims of the situation.He pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative for their tireless efforts to promote a political settlement in observance of United Nations resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops  an end to violations of the territorial integrity of Pakistan  which have escalated recently  and the return of the refugees to their homeland in safety and honor.International concern is equally deep with regard to the situation in Kampuchea  which parallels the situation in Afghanistan. My Government appeals to all parties to work actively for a just and lasting negotiated settlement in accordance with United Nations resolutions  we welcome the proposal of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for indirect talks. However  flexibility and a sincere willingness to solve differences at the conference table are needed from all quarters if the occupation is to end and the Kampuchean people are to be allowed to decide their own destiny.My Government welcomes the initiation of direct talks between the south and the north of Korea  and we hope that the dialog established will make a lasting contribution towards the establishment of a state of peace on the Korean peninsula in which the division of the nation may be overcome in accordance with the freely expressed will of the people.Developments in Central America during the past year have shown how difficult it is to find peaceful  long-term solutions to the complex problems of that region. In spite of all setbacks  the four Contadora countries have continued their untiring peace efforts. On behalf of the Danish Government I should like to pay a tribute to them for their perseverance.It is the firm conviction of my Government that there is no alternative to the Contadora peace process. It must be fully supported. We urge the Governments of Central America to observe and implement the principles embodied in the Document of Objectives  adopted within the Contadora framework in September 1983. All Governments must refrain from acts which run counter to the principles of international law.In this connection  I can associate myself fully with the views stated by the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg on behalf of the 10 members of the European Community.The Danish Government is greatly encouraged by the successful outcome of the World Conference in Nairobi marking the end of the United Nations Decade for Women. It is a source of satisfaction and inspiration for all 153 participating States that consensus was achieved in Nairobi on a substantive document concerning forward-looking strategies. We now have to live up to the commitments undertaken at Nairobi by a determined follow-up to the Conference. The conclusions of the Nairobi Conference form an integral part of the impressive body of international human rights standards developed by this Organization and in other international forums  in particular over the last 20 years. It is tragic  however  that the universal consensus on these standards is not matched by a similarly universal adherence to the same standards in the practice of states.Those who exercise their internationally recognized fundamental human rights and those who are active in ensuring the protection of the human rights of others  are often the first to be victimized. Unfortunately  human beings are often subjected to persecution for less  oz for no reason at all. Respect for the right to know and act upon one's rights is indeed an indispensable prerequisite for the realization of all human rights.The political will to co-operate fully with international institutions established to safeguard human rights is another prerequisite for the realization of international human rights standards. Time and time again  however States have refused to co-operate with the international community.It is the responsibility of Governments to respect and ensure the realization of human rights. Fortunately  however  others share our concern for human rights. Without the activities of individuals and private humanitarian organizations the international effort to promote and protect human rights would lack much of its substance. They deserve our respect and support.The international economic situation remains characterized by features of transition. In many industrialized countries the economic recovery  which was vigorous in 1983 and especially in 1984  has still to find a level which is sustainable over the medium term.Invigorated efforts must be made to broaden the recovery and to promote economic development in the third world. In this respect  the role of an open and truly international trade system is of paramount importance. The responsibility for ensuring that this system does not fall victim to the strains inherent in transition should be viewed as one we all share. Other important objectives are the achievement of a further reduction of international interest rates and a higher degree of exchange-rate stability.However  if developing countries are to benefit fully from the economic recovery their own economic policies are of crucial importance. Many Governments have already taken steps towards the painful but necessary adjustments in the economic conditions their countries are facing. Such endeavors aiming at further mobilization and necessary reallocation of domestic resources for development should  of course  be pursued  but they can only succeed if complemented by determined support from the international community.Concessional flows thus remain of the utmost importance to developing countries  in particular to the poorest and least ""developed among them. The empowerment of the global economic situation has been uneven but the recovery now in progress in the industrial world should enhance the possibilities of further increases in official development assistance in the years ahead  strenuous efforts must be made by the industrialized countries to reach the aid targets agreed upon by the international community.Denmark remains committed to contributing its share of development aid. In the spring of this year the Danish Parliament adopted a resolution aimed at reaching the 1 per cent target for official development assistance by 1992. Next year Danish development assistance will rise to 0.82 per cent of our gross national product.As in the past  the- major part of Denmark's development assistance is allocated to the poorest countries. The present disturbing downward trend in these countries' share of development assistance must be reversed quickly. The Danish Government sincerely hopes that the midterm review of the substantial new program of action for the least developed countries  which is to be undertaken in a few days' time  will lead to renewed commitment by all donors to increase substantially their assistance to the least developed countries.In Sub-Saharan Africa the urgent need for emergency relief is likely to persist for some time. But solidarity with the millions of people who suffer today should divert neither attention nor funds from the long-term development needs of the African countries. Emergency aid and development aid must be closely interrelated if the vicious circle is to be broken.The multilateral development institutions play an indispensable role in providing assistance to developing countries. It is  therefore  vitally important to secure a stable flow of funds to these organizations. Eroding their budgets by reducing contributions - be it little by little or suddenly and sharply - would very seriously affect the development prospects of the third world.The survival of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is threatened by lack of agreement among donor groups on the principles for a new replenishment. This fund has proved to be a remarkable field for the pursuit of new ideas  new principles  and new approaches to providing assistance to the rural poor of the developing world. Let us make a strong effort to settle the disagreements quickly so that IFAD will be enabled to continue its highly commendable work.Being one of the major contributors to the United Nations Development program (UNDP)  Denmark has noted with particular satisfaction the steps which were taken at the United Nations Development program's last meeting of the Governing Council to further improve the quality of UNDP's work and to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. It is to be hoped that this will encourage increased support from those donors who at present contribute less than could be expected of them.Improving the health situation is a major task of United Nations development assistance. In accordance with resolutions adopted by this Assembly in 1976 and 1982 children have been the main target group for immunization programs to eradicate by 1990 the six most common communicable diseases. It seems highly appropriate that at this fortieth anniversary session we should solemnly confirm our common commitment to take all necessary steps towards the fulfillment of this target.In my introductory remarks I pointed out that the anniversary celebration in October would be a good occasion for both stocktaking and for looking ahead.The theme chosen for the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations: ""The United Nations - for a better world"" covers both these aspects the stocktaking and  in particular  the forward looking. And with good reason. For a while we can all agree that despite the efforts of the United Nations the world is not a perfect one  there is fortunately still time for all of us to recommit ourselves - as the Secretary-General has urged on numerous occasions - to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and to give the United Nations the priority it deserves in order to enable it to fulfill its vast potential."
"39",1994,"DOM",40,1985,"This session of the General Assembly is of a very special nature because of its great historical significance. The international community has expressed the hope that the year 1985  in which we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  will mark the beginning of an era of lasting peace and justice throughout the world  as well as one of social and economic development  progress and independence for all peoples of the world. In view of the great importance that the work of this session will have for the future of our organization  your election  Mr. President  could not have been wiser or more just. You possess not only a thorough knowledge of the work of the United Nations  acquired over a period of many years  but also a broad understanding of the role that the Organization should play in the creation of a better world. Moreover  your election is a recognition of the outstanding role played by Spain in the evolution of the world's culture and the indisputable contribution it has made to the development of the norms and principles governing the conduct of nations in their mutual relations. It is also a significant demonstration of affection for the noble people of Spain  at present living through one of the glorious periods in its history as a result of its steadfast resolve to live under a system in which democracy and justice prevail. In the circumstances  this special session could not have begun under better auspices.I also wish to take this opportunity to pay a most sincere tribute to the magnificent job done by your predecessor  Ambassador Lusaka of Zambia  whose constant devotion to his work and faith in the organization's future allowed him to bring to a successful conclusion all the activities connected with the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the united Nations.It also gives me great pleasure to mention the dedication and zeal with which the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  is carrying out his important tasks. His confidence in this Organization and his ideas regarding its revitalization  to which all Members must contribute  compel us to follow the guidelines he has laid down  which are both wise and sincere.I cannot proceed with my statement before referring to the great sorrow felt in the Dominican Republic with regard to the tragedy that has befallen Mexico  a country closely linked to ours. We would reiterate the appeal addressed by the General Assembly to the international community that the flow of assistance to the victims should be maintained on the basis of a co-operative effort.The Dominican Government and people reiterate their constant support for the purposes and principles that led to the establishment of the United Nations 40 years ago. The Dominican Republic  together with the other countries of Latin America  had the honor of being represented in San Francisco when the Charter of this international body was signed.I reiterate my country's unswerving support of the principle enshrined in the Charter concerning respect for the self-determination of peoples and our condemnation of attacks against the sovereignty of States  whatever form they nay take. The Dominican Republic is one of the democracies most concerned with preventing the violation of those principles  whose effectiveness is one of the main goals of our world Organization.On the occasion of the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the States Members have the duty to stop and think about the effectiveness of our Organization aware that its success or failure is up to us. This is a responsibility that all the States Members have to assume  thus removing from the United Nations a guilt that is not attributable to it.This is also a time for States Members to reaffirm their determination to unite to combat the serious problems that we are facing in a world that is increasingly interdependent and in which the destiny of union to which the human race is called becomes increasingly clear and inevitable.We agree with what the Secretary-General says in his annual report. His chief concern is the future  threatened as it is by nuclear war  a danger which calls for effective action by the United Nations and political will on the part of its States Members to respect the decisions and resolutions of the world Organization.Thus the developing countries come to this Assembly more resolved than ever to denounce the devastating effects on our economic growth and social peace of the arms race and its astronomical costs. The Secretary-General  in a statement he made during his recent official visit to my country  said that:""The United Nations is sounding the alarm against the accumulation of armaments  which not only increases international tensions but also aggravates and prolongs underdevelopment.""Among the conflicts that constitute a threat to international peace and security we are particularly affected by and concerned at that in Central America. We are a Latin American country  situated not far from the very vortex of this conflict; the struggles and tensions in that area are struggles and tensions among brother peoples.Ever since its present Government came to power the Dominican Republic has firmly and clearly stated that only a peaceful  negotiated settlement can resolve this serious conflict. Consequently the Dominican Government has always maintained its absolutely unswerving support for the activities for peace of the Contadora Group  which is advocating a Latin American solution to a crisis caused essentially by the age-old problems of the underdevelopment and social injustice that prevail in that region.Contadora's magnificent work  as we have said many times  has prevented a widespread conflagration that would jeopardize the peace and security of the region  with serious repercussions that could affect the whole international community.At the present time one last great effort is required to induce the Central American countries immediately to sign the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  which is based on one of the great diplomatic successes of Contadora - the Document of Objectives adopted in September 1983 by the Central American countries.In speaking of the Central American crisis we must stress  as we have said  that its origin is indubitably linked with the serious social and economic problems of that region. However  we fully agree with what was said a few days ago from this rostrum by our dear friend  the Foreign Minister of Mexico  Bernardo Sepulveda Amor  namely:""... we cannot fail to recognize that the conflict implies geo-political considerations of zones of influence and strategic balance; nor is it possible to ignore the fact that the cessation of foreign interference is a decisive condition for achieving any peaceful settlement in Central America."" (A/40/PV.8  p. 29)For that reason  the Dominican Republic has always held the view that the Contadora Group  in its productive activities for peace  requires active support and solidarity from all Latin American countries  particularly from the democracies. That is why our Government was the first to respond positively  decisively and energetically to the recent establishment of a Support Group for Contadora by the South American countries.Furthermore  in this same context  we have always states	clearly andfirmly the need for total support from the United States and Cuba to the Contadora Act as essential for its full and effective implementation.We follow with great interest and concern the development and evolution of conflicts in other areas of the world where there is disregard for the guiding principles of the United Nations Charter concerning respect for the national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  non-intervention  non-interference in internal affairs  the non-use of the threat or use of force  while at the same time attempts are made to restrict the right of peoples to self- determination by means of foreign occupation or colonial domination.We firmly uphold the view that there is no international dispute or conflict that cannot be resolved on the basis of dialog and negotiation among the parties directly concerned; in other words  a peaceful and political settlement.In the framework of the principles that I mentioned earlier can be found the basis for an immediate solution of the problems facing various countries in different areas of the world  such as those of the Middle East  Kampuchea  Korea  Cyprus and Afghanistan  among others  on which we have expressed clear and firm views in earlier statements. In particular  I reiterate the unchanging position of the Dominican Government  namely  that to achieve a durable peace in the Middle East it is essential that all the parties involved in the conflict take part in the negotiating process.We recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  as well as its right to establish a State on Palestinian territory  without disregarding  as far as Israel is concerned  the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) concerning the right of all countries in the region to live in peace within secure and well-defined boundaries.It is important to note  and we heartily welcome  the efforts steadfastly exerted by other countries of the region not directly involved in the conflict in support of the steps to achieve a peaceful solution. At the same time we *re hopeful that other peace initiatives will emerge in the region itself and will have the support of the international community.The Dominican Republic joins in the appeal so often made in this forum for the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory.Furthermore the Dominican Republic also welcomes the progress made in recent months in the talks between South Korea and North Korea in the area of bilateral economic co-operation and cultural exchanges.We are pleased to note that through dialog  negotiation and mutual understanding the situation in Korea may be brought to a satisfactory settlement.Similarly  we endorse the just claims of Argentina regarding the problem of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and we hope that the talks between Argentina and the United Kingdom will be resumed with a view to seeking a peaceful and amicable solution to this problem.Every year the Dominican Republic reiterates its total condemnation of the abhorrent practice of apartheid. In this regard we must express our concern over the worsening and growing deterioration of the situation in South Africa  where the absurd policy of apartheid is producing untold human suffering  arbitrary mass arrests and forced displacement of great sectors of the population. We wholeheartedly join in the unanimous international call for the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.We wish also to reiterate our firm support for the heroic struggle waged by the people of Namibia for its self-determination and independence and to reaffirmour unswerving position to the effect that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the sole acceptable basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian conflict.The serious world economic crisis is becoming ominous. In general terms  growth rates do not even measure up to those of the 1970s. The anticipated recovery in the industrialized countries has not met initial expectations. The limited recovery has not had any significant effect on the expansion of third-world exports. Hence the tendency of concentrating the benefits of world economic growth in the industrialized countries continues.Unemployment rates in the developing countries are reaching alarming levels. In this International Youth Year  millions of young people will swell the legions of those who are already desperately seeking work  but in vain.As I mentioned earlier  the recovery in the major industrialized economies has not had any beneficial effect on the third-world countries. Stubborn protectionist measures in time of depression turn the markets of the developed countries into impregnable fortresses  in violation of international agreements.Over the past 10 years the prices of third-world export products have collapsed and reached indefensible levels  thus destroying the most optimistic programs for adjustment and economic recovery.With regard to international trade  the many meetings of the General Agreement in Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have not managed to meet the aspirations of the developing countries regarding the gradual elimination of the limits imposed on on their export products. On the contrary  after the GATT Ministerial Meeting in 1982  the industrialized nations imposed greater restrictions in disregard of their commitments and the rules and principles of the General Agreement.Last year in this Hall I spoke of the importance for the Dominican Republic ofsugar as a main source of foreign currency and I mentioned the 20 per- cent reduction announced by the United States in the quota alloted to producing countries. In recent days the export quota from my country to the united States market has once again been reduced as a result of pressures from already highly protected producers. These reductions largely cancel out the benefits of the assistance programs that great nation is carrying out on behalf of our people.However  even-more serious for our sugar industry is the continuance of subsidy policies practiced by the European Economic Community (EEC) for the benefit of its producers which substantially depress prices on the international market.A new round of GATT negotiations is under way  and issues vital for developing countries  such as tropical products  quantitative restrictions  textiles and subsidies on agricultural products  remain to be solved. We believe that gradual implementation of the GATT General Convention and the commitments adopted at earlier meetings constitute a point of departure for dealing with new items put forward by countries which traditionally ignore GATT provisions.The debt problem is today the greatest challenge facing Latin American countries. Indeed  the enormous amount of our countries' debt  which has reached $370 billion  constitutes a problem of such magnitude that it can no longer be ignored by those who make demands and call for implementation of traditional economic policies to allow them to recover their loans.Latin America devotes more than 35 per cent of its annual exports to paying the interest on its foreign debt. Payment of the debt is made more difficult by the lack of opportunities significantly to increase our exports. A region cannot develop by exporting capital when it most needs to retain it.The developing countries are not opposed to programs of adjustment as such. Our complaint is that usually the stabilization programs  in particular those ofthe International Monetary Fund (IMF)  do not eliminate the structural imbalances and in practice lead to greater social costs and political pressures.Furthermore  the increased rate of inflation  the problems of exchange rates and the decline of our peoples' standards of living - elements in a typical adjustment program - are not even offset by a sufficient flow of resources from outside. Similarly  in exercising strict control over the adjustment programs the IMF does not take into account the damage caused our external sector by the protectionist and deficit policies of some industrialized countries. In general  the goals of the International Monetary Fund and the development policies of the third-world countries diverge. Frequently the obligation to achieve certain objectives leads to increased unemployment and the reduction of domestic demand  thus harming the production and financial systems.Like other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  the Dominican Republic has been suffering from the instability in international trade  the decline in export income  the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  the recessive effects of adjustment programs and the social pressures that are involved in this situation.The President of the Dominican Republic  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco  in a statement he made on the occasion of the ministerial meeting of the Cartagena Consensus held last February stated the following:""It is essential that the debt be paid - not by impoverishing our peoples even further  but by developing their economic potential. This requires the active co-operation of industrialized countries and international bodies to raise  with their financial and technical support  the purchasing power and productive capacity of the people of the region so that higher production and prices may partially cancel out external obligations  while at the same time improving living conditions in the region.""This would be a firm basis for stability and a stronger international financial system.""Despite the picture I have drawn  our country  under the wise leadership of President Salvador Jorge Blanco  and at great sacrifice in the face of enormous obstacles  has been able to honor its commitments vis-li-vis the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private international banks.The most recent assessments of the international economic situation show that the hoped for recovery has not led to a sustained rate of growth in the gross product of our region. In view of such prospects  it is even more necessary to have a political dialog among creditors and debtors as an effective means of producing general solutions to the debt problem.These demands are a fundamental part of the Cartagena Consensus  which united the efforts of foreign and finance ministers of 11 countries of the region  vigorously supported by their Heads of State. The statements by qualified spokesmen from the region and recent statements made here in this Organization by the Presidents of Brazil  Peru  Uruguay and Venezuela reflect the need for the political dialog that we are advocating.Without any doubt  the Cartagena Consensus  as a concerted-action group  has largely helped to consolidate Latin American solidarity and has produced positive effects on the processes of rescheduling the external debts of our countries.We should refer here to a concept that the Cartagena Consensus group of countries has systematically rejected. I am speaking of the formation of a so-called debtors' club . We oppose that idea  having always understood that it would mean global and collective negotiation of the Latin American external debt. However  we emphatically advocate the institutionalization of a whole set of principles and common parameters that would serve as a point of reference and contribute to the success of the separate negotiations of each country.Among such guidelines I would cite those established by the Cartagena Group to grant the same most favourable possible conditions to all countries as are obtained by a single country in its individual relations. Similarly  it is vitally important to establish a viable relationship between export income  the flow of new capital and- foreign debt-servicing so as to guarantee the payment of external commitments in the same ratio as the region's economic growth.Furthermore  there is no overlooking the fact that the efforts of Cartagena  and its much-needed and reasonable proposals  have contributed largely to the entire international community's perceptibly growing awareness of the problems. This is apparent from statements by high-ranking political figures from the developed countries and from concrete proposals that are beginning to be outlined in those countries. These proposals  if they become effective in the short term  could contribute - if not to solving the entire serious debt problem - at least to initiating effective remedial processes in the quest for a solution.In this context  our attention is concentrated on the results that may emerge from the meeting now being held in Seoul  and from the forthcoming negotiating round on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).The overwhelming debt situation is of such magnitude and its consequences are of such proportions that it is curious but encouraging to see that such influential  and yet such dissimilar spokesmen as Henry Kissinger and Fidel Castro  agree on the peremptory necessity of seeking a solution to this serious problem. Of course  each has his own proposals and approaches.Despite the aforementioned gloomy prospects  third world countries are striving to meet the challenge imposed on them by the present economic crisis. This is apparent from the boom in South-South co-operation  encouraged by the Group of 77  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the active participation of developing countries in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCPAD)  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and other forums of an economic character where negotiations are underway.As part of these efforts  the third world nations have put forward initiatives  such as the Arusha and Caracas programs  they have encouraged programs of co-operation within the United Nations and have promoted the creation of specialized agencies to deal with problems chiefly affecting the third world.In particular  Latin America and the Caribbean  with their firm determination to engage in dialog and consultation  have also created many mechanisms for integration and regional and subregional co-operation. Among them we would cite the particular importance of the Latin American Economic System (SELA)  which was set up in 1975  as a regional instrument to implement the economic guidelines adopted by the Group of 77  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the postulates of the new international economic order.SELA at present is one of the most effective mechanisms for co-operation among third world countries. On the tenth anniversary of the establishment of SELA  we venture  on behalf of the Dominican Republic  to welcome all the initiatives that have emerged from that body with a view to the consolidation of interregional links.Furthermore  we must recognize the valuable contribution of the United Nations system to the success of co-operation programs to benefit developing countries.There is no doubt that the General Assembly's decision to proclaim 1985 as the International Youth Year has led to a vigorous  world-wide movement that has highlighted the importance of youth in the task of forging the future of mankind. We need the support of that valuable sector of the population to create the basis and conditions for a more just and equitable international society.Inspired by these noble goals  the Government of the Dominican Republic set up a national committee to co-ordinate all activities related to the preparation and commemoration of International Youth Year. That committee has carried out an active campaign throughout our national territory with the aim of promoting the role of youth in the process of national development  while at the same time involving young people in my country to participate in the study and solution of our most crucial problems.It is of especial importance that the international community endeavor to encourage programs of action to guarantee economic and social security for elderly people  while offering a whole series of opportunities for them to continue to contribute to the development of their respective countries.Furthermore  the aim of effectively implementing the international plan of action regarding elderly people  adopted by the same General Assembly  the delegation of the Dominican Republic considered it appropriate to set up a similar body to the united Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  in other words  to set up a United Nations program that would be financed by voluntary contributions and that would protect elderly people in the same way that UNICEF protects children.With regard to UNICEF  I must inform the international community in this General Assembly that the Government of the Dominican Republic has carried out an intensive national campaign to vaccinate children against the main lethal diseases that affect children. This campaign has had public recognition from UNICEF  and we shall be able to immunize all of our children before 1990.We consider it very important that this Assembly should encourage all countries that have not yet done so to sign the Convention on the Law of the Sea.Last year in this General Assembly the Dominican Republic gave its determined support to the Quito Declaration on drug trafficking and expressed its total solidarity with the view that drug trafficking was a crime against mankind. Bearing in mind the serious problem of the abuse and illicit traffic in drugs  we welcome and support the Secretary-General's proposal for a world conference to consider the implications of this serious problem.To tackle all the aspects of this scourge of mankind is an unavoidable necessity for the international community  in view of the material and human damage caused to our societies  in particular to young people  and the unforeseeable consequences of that scourge.Aware of the serious repercussions for our national life of the consumption and traffic in drugs  the Dominican Republic has undertaken a firm campaign to combat this pernicious practice. A few days ago  our President informed the whole nation of the arrest and break-up of a group of drug traffickers among whomwere involved both foreigners and Dominicans.At the same time  the Dominican Republic wishes to egress its serious concern over the increase in acts of terrorism in international life. We are concerned over the fate of the daughter of the President of El Salvador  and we hope that she may soon be released  to the relief of her family and so as to reduce the tensions that this kidnapping has caused.It is an essential part of the policy of the Dominican Republic to observe  promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. As a consequence of our strict concern for these guidelines  I can state with legitimate pride that in the Dominican Republic such rights and freedoms are effectively enjoyed. This is an undeniable fact. In view of our interest in this subject  we are always ready to co-operate with the United Nations and all bodies in the United Nations system to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Dominican Republic has enthusiastically supported from the outset the establishment of the Decade for Women and has taken an active part in the various events connected with it  including the most recent Conference held in Nairobi  to evaluate the goals of this Decade  and we share the general concern over the status of women and their participation in development.We  as the host country  have given all the necessary support to the activities of the United Nations International Institute for Research and Training of Women. We are very pleased to see the quality and effectiveness of the work which that body has done. In acting as host to that organization  the Dominican Republic shows its commitment to the United Nations Decade for Women. We wish to make an appeal to all countries here to step up their co-operation with the Institute.The presence at this session of an unprecedented number of heads of State is clear proof of the growing importance that States Members attach to international relations  and the United Nations is the forum par excellence to express our policies and collectively to formulate positions on political and economic situations  as well as to define joint development strategies.In view of the fact that these relations must be intensified  it is for the United Nations to channel them in the most effective manner. It is for the United Nations to play the role of a body where joint negotiations can be held. It is for the United Nations to offer support to States Members in their work to attain economic independence and the growth and development of their peoples. And  what is most important  it is for the United Nations to open the way to the daily struggle for a more just world.At such an opportune time as the fortieth anniversary  we should reflect calmly and deeply on the serious threats hanging over the human race  even its total extermination. Likewise  we must think of the overwhelming obstacles to true social justice in and among peoples.But in the tenacious struggle among men of goodwill for this ideal world of peace  security and justice  solidarity and co-operation  dreamed of by the creators of this great Organization  let us recognize once again that it is the Organization that constitutes the most appropriate instrument to achieve those supreme goals of mankind. By strengthening our faith and our efforts in this Organization  we shall bequeath this ideal world to new generations whose preservation  peace and security are our greatest obligation before history."
"40",2041,"DZA",40,1985,"Mr. President  at this session which is a high point in the life of the Organization  it is indeed fitting that the United Nations should have honored and singled out one of its most deserving and energetic servants. Hence I do not know what would be more appropriate: to congratulate you. Sir  on this honor and distinction that has been conferred upon you or to congratulate ourselves on our judicious choice which ensures for our Assembly an invaluable contribution from one of the most dedicated observers of the vicissitudes of the Organization.At a time when the Organization is reviewing its past  probing the present and wondering about its future  it is extremely comforting to have a man of your commitment  lucidity and selfless dedication guiding us towards what we believe to be best for our turbulent and troubled world. To your country  Spain  we owe a debt of gratitude for having provided us with a citizen of the world dedicated to the ideals of the United Nations.Your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  also deserves an expression of great gratitude. This worthy son of Africa has left you the exemplary legacy of a kind-hearted man. The actions and convictions of a man of his stature and qualities gives hope and strength to those who believe that mankind has the necessary resources to work for justice and a better world for all.A particular tribute must be paid to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The excellent report he has given us is in itself sufficient proof of his determination and courage. In his vast undertaking and the reforms he seeks to be applied collectively  we wish to assure him that we will stand by his side and join forces with him.The United Nations is currently commemorating its fortieth anniversary. In a human lifetime 40 years is already a generation  just as it is also an appropriate time for taking measures to correct  adapt or redirect actions towards goals  aspirations and ambitions in the light of past experience  and the same holds true for organizations. Forty years ago  in the last smoldering fires of a war which shamed mankind  the United Nations was born in a world which had categorically rejected war and made a wager on peace; at a time when colonialism had tarnished human civilization  it condemned the oppression of man by man and chose freedom; in a world living in poverty and destitution  it promised that progress would be made.Emerging from total chaos born out of madness  the United Nations sought to restore order and reason - to its credit  its first step towards dignity for all. That the United Nations has brought together the greatest number of peoples and States mankind has ever known is due to the astuteness of its wager and the majesty of its promise. There is no doubt that this wager and this promise is still the order of the day.The United Nations is an idea as well as an act of hope. It is an idea which will always hold that dialog offers more than an unbridled exercise of force; that fear  even organized fear  can never replace confidence; that the balance of terror still remains terror; that if freedom can accommodate even one single violation  it is no longer true freedom; and  finally  that no order can be acceptable where the opulence of a few draws on the poverty of the many.•The United Nations  therefore  is an act of hope  because of its faith in the capacity of man to come to grips with problems and to make the right choices -especially when confronted with today's very serious problems and prevailing circumstance.Indeed  we are daily coming closer to the ultimate choice: prosperity in solidarity or uncontrollable and inevitable turbulence; to consolidate the bases of guaranteed universal destruction and increase the risk of its happening or ensure harmonious coexistence and friendly ties that will enable mankind to survive.At this period of stocktaking there is no principle of the United Nations that has been altered or made invalid in the 40 years of its existence. Time has not made any of its aims obsolete. Its outlook  its concept and its progress remain as meaningful as ever. The breadth of our ambition has lacked only the power of action and our great dreams have not been made everyday realities.That the United Nations exists is already a meaningful achievement. If our Organization served only as a means of communication between peoples  that alone would justify its being maintained; if it served only as a forum in which our States could speak and listen to each other  it should still be upheld; if it served only to allow dialog to prevail over conflict  it would still deserve our every effort to make it strong.But we expect more than that of the United Nations. If the United Nations is to fulfill our hopes and expectations we must believe in it and make of it a real instrument of peace and co-operation among nations by giving it the necessary means to carry out its universal mission.None of this can diminish the achievements of the United Nations. Even if it has merely transferred conflicts from one arena to another  it has  for the present generation  exorcised the specter of world conflict; in their long march towards their destiny  all the oppressed peoples have seen the Organization join them in their struggle and have found in it understanding  solace and support. To a world divided against itself it has pointed out the path of true reconciliation based on a system of peace through collective security and co-operation.Basically  the United Nations has carried the burden of bringing some semblance of order and justice to international relations. In so doing  it has set forth conditions  formulated guiding principles and outlined a framework. It is most regrettable that the collective effort has not been commensurate with the intentions and that the action taken has not been in line with the new vision of the world. The need for a system of collective security gave way to a stunning accumulation of armaments; true security through disarmament has been replaced by a distorted form of security based on deterrence  as if there were no choice between the imposition of power and collective suicide.Surely this is an immoral state of affairs at a time when not all the people of our planet are assured of food  health  education and shelter and precious resources are fueling the forces of destruction. That represents a clear denial of all the things that constitute the essence and spirit of the United Nations.We must note that the new order of international co-operation announced by the United Nations has not yet been put into practice. The United Nations has not responded to the challenge of a new international economic order  international development strategies or global negotiations. As was the case with disarmament  certain Members lacked the necessary will  conviction and foresight.We need only look at the horizons of Palestine  Namibia  South Africa  western Sahara and other places to measure the extent to which one of the essential tasks of the United Nations has remained unaccomplished.The victim of factitious political quarrels  tainted by the preference for selective bilateralism and oriented away from multilateral action or called upon to take sides when in fact it should be acting as judge  the United Nations is but the image of the society that gave it birth; torn between East and West  North and South  and the protagonists in the last enclaves in which the fate of freedom against oppression is being decided  that society cannot help but transfer its deep divisions to our Organization.The nature of present-day international relations  which are characterized by conflict  reflects upon the United Nations and saps its effectiveness. The attachment of some to the privileges of a garish opulence acquired through their dominant positions and at the cost of the total deprivation of others has condemned the United Nations to inaction. Even the rights of peoples and the causes of freedom are subjected to obstacles that can be explained or understood only in the light of other calculations  other interests and other goals that have no connection with the work of the United Nations. Because we believe that the vision and action of the United Nations are part of the course of history  we cannot remain silent about its weaknesses.Algeria cannot forget that it was at the United Nations that its struggle for freedom received one of the most striking manifestations of sympathy. It was here that Algeria found friends  comrades and brothers  and they were many; it was here  finally  that the martyrdom of its people and the justice of its struggle were made known to the world.The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization is taking place in a situation that clearly reveals what remains to be done.The world climate is disturbed. The reopening of East-West negotiations has occurred in an atmosphere of reciprocal mistrust and amid an escalation of shows of force in all environments  although nature intended them for other purposes.In an interdependent world everything that can contribute  even in a limited way  to improving international relations should be given consideration. We remain convinced of the need to establish a world order free from the policies of spheres of influence  able to rely upon general and complete disarmament and based on a system of real collective security. The extension of the reopened. East-West negotiations to include regional or local tensions  crises and conflicts is meaningful in this regard.There can be no detente unless it is universal  as indeed there can be no security unless it is shared by all.If the continuation of tension  of crises and regional disputes are of concern to the whole international community  then it is essential that a settlement of disputes should not be tied to the geo-strategic interests of any particular Member.In present-day international economic relations  we see proof of the many tasks that the United Nations has not been able to accomplish. We commemorate these 40 years of the existence of our Organization in a world which has been shaken by acute economic crisis. Whether we speak of international trade  of the monetary system  of the financial system  of agriculture  industrialization or the commodities market  it is the very structures of the world's economic system which has been shaken.Worse than precarious  the present system of economic international relations is obsolete. It is not adapted to present-day problems or to the new conditions of our times. And this is undeniable. It was able to carry out its historic task when it was devoted to building up the exclusive prosperity of a few  but this system very quickly showed that it was inadequate when faced with the challenge of universal prosperity.World indebtedness today is the revealing factor which shows up the disruptions and the inadequacies of the system.The economic situation in Africa is another revealing factor  The drama of survival  which Africa lives through on a daily basis  must awaken our conscience. The United Nations has brought solace to Africa in its distress  but action and assistance at present under way are not commensurate with the scope and the reality of the needs in Africa. A consistent and integrated program of economic recovery remains essential for Africa. This constitutes a challenge for internationalco-operation and development which must be recognized in order to reactivate its original spirit and reconcile us to its original vocation.The twenty-first Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (GAU) showed! the way to the rehabilitation of African economies. The African States agreed on the responsibilities they were prepared to shoulder. They also told the international community and the United Nations system what they expected of them.In so far as it is capable of meeting these expectations  the United Nations will find an ideal occasion to live up to its ideals.Over and beyond its immediate intervention in areas of critical interest and its response to calls for assistance from certain countries or regions  the United -Nations has been faced with an overall problem by reason of the world economic crisis. From that standpoint the establishment of a new international economic order is consistent with the course of history.In a world of interdependence  where obviously all problems are closely interrelated  there is no real alternative to global negotiations. In taking note of the obstacles which have prevented them from being initiated  and at the same time assessing their ability to bring a true solution to the problems before us  we cannot but maintain our belief that global negotiations constitute the future for a North-South dialog engaged in loyally and with determination.The international financial and monetary system is one of the main parameters of the world economic crisis which we have to face. Its present inadequacy restricts growth and development. It must therefore be revised in the common interest.The world economic crisis the source of serious instability in international relations. Its continuation will inevitably degenerate into further aggravations for which one day we will have to pay a very high price. Must that actually happen in order for us to effect  at a cost which we cannot count today  the essential changes and transformations which must be brought about in the world economy? The latter provides sufficient grounds for concern which should encourage us immediately to take collective action capable of reversing the present course of events. The world economic crisis  because of the diversity of its effects and its ramifications in international life  must lead us to seek solutions on the basis of shared political responsibility.We can tackle that task provided we can draw  with lucidity and courage  from the lessons we have learned in the past.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has dedicated itself to that particular task  having always emphasized its importance.This is the appropriate time to refer to the contribution made by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in identifying itself with the ideals of the United Nations.The independence of peoples  collective security  disarmament and development  which form the very basis and essence of the United Nations  are also causes to which non-alignment is dedicated.By the very fact that it stands aside from all blocs  non-alignment has made a contribution to peace which is already a fact of history.But by placing Atself outside blocs  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries does not intend to remain passive. An independent source of reflection and action  it has sought to contribute to an improvement in international relations through proposals and initiatives. The difficulties experienced in carrying them out have not discouraged the Movement from persisting in its efforts.After a quartet century of existence. the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has reason to take pride in having served the United Nations.We have come here today to share our satisfaction and our frustrations with regard to the United Nations  but we are also here today to express our firm attachment to the ideals of the Organization. There is no better proof of this attachment than the principles which are the basis of at country's policies and action in our region. The principles are mutual respect  good-neighborliness and co-operation; the action is to mobilize the region's entire potential for the benefit of our stability and the progress of our peoples.Together with all others displaying goodwill  Algeria is dedicated to the establishment of a united Maghreb achieved through reconciliation between all brotherly peoples and the removal of all obstacles  whatever their nature or scope. The Greater Maghreb can only translate vision into reality through a determined commitment of all those involved.If those parties are convinced of the inevitability of the establishment of a United Maghreb  they must create the most favorable conditions for it. The only destiny for the peoples of the Maghreb is a common destiny. Their shared history has foreordained that destiny. Divided  we shall have no power and our voice will not be heard: united  we shall become a zone of prosperity.and be substantial partners as a result of our combined wills and capacities.The choice before us is therefore crystal-clear  and so is the right choice. We in Algeria are confident that the right choice will be made.But the Greater Maghreb cannot be built up through the sacrifice of any one of its peoples - to be specific  the people of Western Sahara - without abandoning our long-held aspirations and without losing our own souls.The Western Sahara conflict is at the same time a national and an international fact. There is both a national and an international reality in that territory. Consequently any final and peaceful solution of that conflict must ensure that that dual reality will be fully taken into account.The Organization of African Unity  the United Nations and  more recently  in Luanda  the Non-Aligned Movement have taken a common stand evoking that dual reality  and defining its framework and the appropriate means. The concept is a decolonization process to be concluded by implementing the right of the people of that territory to self-determination and independence. The framework would involve direct negotiations between the parties to the conflict. The means would be a free and fair self-determination referendum without administrative or military constraints  and both parties to the conflict  identified as such  would negotiate the modalities of such a referendum. There is full international consensus on such a step. It is well known where the responsibility lies for the fact that it has not been taken and also for the attempts to pervert the consensus and distort the settlement process which is the subject of that consensus.In this respect  I would recall these facts. First  that since the conflict in western Sahara concerns a decolonization process that remains to be completed  there can be no viable and credible settlement that is not concluded by the combatants and guaranteed by them; secondly  formally declaring that it will have no other value than to confirm a fait accompli is not a referendum; and lastly i  the Organization of African Unity  together with the united Nations  have full responsibility for a decolonization process described as such by both organizations.Having exercised all means within its power to put an end to this fratricidal conflict  Algeria reiterates; its appeal to reason as well as to the sense of responsibility of those who have still not shown a readiness to enable the peoples of the region to cease using their energies in the service of destruction and to join forces to build their country.Now that the path to peace has been clearly indicated  we congratulate the Organization of African unity  the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement on what they have achieved. We would encourage the United Nations Secretary-General to collaborate with the authorities of the African organization to ensure strict application of the settlement plan  on which there is a universal consensus.The United Nations has condemned apartheid as a crime against humanity. The racial oppression suffered by the South African people  the illegal occupation of Namibia and the aggression and intimidation suffered by the front-line countries cannot be described as anything but crimes against humanity.Some among us here have believed the promises that apartheid would change  while others have actively encouraged those promises. Today that system has revealed itself to the world for what it really is and for what it always has been  it is within its own logic that its truly evil nature is to be found; it is within that logic  but also because of the toleration it has enjoyed that it has been able to survive for so long.Since that awareness has taken considerable time to develop in some quarters  collective action is all the more urgent. That awareness can be expressed only through comprehensive mandatory sanctions.Those who have never abandoned hope in the United Nations and those who have worked for the establishment of justice and peace in southern Africa will draw hope and faith from such action. The peoples of southern Africa and Namibia will be able to draw solace from it in their just struggle. The international community owes the African National Congress  the South West Africa People's Organization and the front-line countries - and through them the whole of Africa - this expression of support in their struggle for their freedom.The crimes of apartheid in southern Africa recall those of Zionism in Palestine and in the Middle East.In speaking here today on this subject I am forced to recall that it was a United Nations concept that led to the present martyrdom of the Palestinian people. In order to ease the conscience of some  a whole people was condemned to exile.The unjust fate of that people  and its unfulfilled destiny  are at the heart of the Middle Bast crisis  with all its regional and international repercussions.This Assembly has recognized the inalienable national rights of the people of Palestine. From henceforth those rights cannot be prejudged or predetermined against the will of that people.Similarly  the General Assembly has bestowed international recognition on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole  legitimate and authentic representative of the Palestinian people. This shows the imperative need for the PLO1s participation in any negotiations on the future of the Palestinian people and therefore peace in the Middle East.Since inalienable national rights are expressed through the natural right to self-determination of all peoples  without exception  it is only logical that the Palestinian people should enjoy those rights without hindrance  particularly through the creation of its independent State in Palestine  its historical homeland. Therefore  any change in the PLO's representative status or its status as a participant in negotiations on the Middle East and Palestine would be totally unacceptable.Finally  in view of the regional and international dimensions of the Middle East crisis and the question of Palestine  it is clear that an international peace conference under United Nations auspices is the only valid framework for a lasting solution.Algeria  which has always believed that Zionist practices are a denial of peace  sees in the brutal aggression against our brother and neighbor  Tunisia  further justification for that belief. The genocide against the Palestinian people  which is a constant goal of Zionism  is being carried to the furthermost corners of the host countries in which the Palestinian people have found refuge. Algeria strongly condemns that new act of aggression and calls on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities and ensure that it does not go unpunished. In acknowledging the wisdom of the purposes and principles of the Charter  we can hope for nothing better than their observance in solving the conflict between Iraq and Iran. Nothing concerns and sadden Algeria more than the persistence of that conflict between two countries with which we maintain brotherly relations. Convinced that the interests of their two peoples lie in an end to the bloodshed and that the waste of energy and strength in the conflict is very 'damaging to their plans for development and progress  Algeria hopes that Iraq and Iran will finally  with faith and courage  prove able to rise above their differences and take up the challenge of peace.Those same purposes and principles of the United Nations must prevail in Central America  where the peoples must together take up that same challenge of peace. The Contadora Group is persevering in a responsible manner to that end. In view of the importance of its task  it deserves broad support and merits our encouragement and our confidence.During its 40 years of existence the United Nations has been the setting for hidden and declared differences  compounded by conflicts of conscience that have increased uncertainty. The United Nations and its multilateral work for peace and development are as valid as they ever were  but while that work has resulted in some worth-while achievements  much remains to be done.The problems of our age demand respect for the ideals on which the United Nations was founded. Any strength that the United Nations possesses can come only from our strength; its rationality can come only from our reason; it can be effective only to the extent that we make the necessary means available to it. Having proclaimed the theme ""United Nations for a better world""  we must remember that that world will be only what we collectively make it."
"41",2088,"ECU",40,1985,"It is an honor for me to convey to you. Sir  the following message from the constitutional President of Ecuador  Mr. Leon Febres Cordero  on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the united Nations:""In the name of the people and the Government of Ecuador  I pay the warmest tribute to the united Nations on the fortieth anniversary of its relentless search for peace and the development of all peoples  and in particular at this time  when in the world such nefarious enemies as violence  terrorism and the traffic in drugs attempt to displace the basic values of mankind and set themselves up as dominant factors on the international scene.The Government over which I preside will resolutely continue to contribute to the task of strengthening the noble principles which inspired the creation of the United Nations and will participate with renewed faith and optimism in efforts to consolidate and implement the principles and purposes enshrined in the San Francisco Charter.""Ecuador's international actions will always take as its norm of conduct the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion and unrestricted defense of human rights everywhere in the world  implemented by its democratic institutions  the universality of our Organization and em end to colonialism.""Given the traditional  peace-loving vocation of Ecuador  X ratified the decision of our national Government to collaborate actively with the world Organization in the search for appropriate ways to maintain peace and strengthen international co-operation.""I wish the President of the General Assembly success in the discharge of his important functions  so that the work of this Assembly may benefit all mankind.""In my capacity as Minister of Foreign Relations  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election. It represents recognition of your merits and your personal prestige  as well as the commitment to international peace and co-operation which has characterized the policy of the Government you represent.I also congratulate Ambassador Paul Lusaka  permanent representative of Zambia  who presided over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly and the preparatory committee of the fortieth anniversary with particular distinction.I also extend my greetings to the Secretary-General of the Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  together with the appreciation of the Ecuadorian people for the effective work that he has accomplished in his very delicate role.I also express the solidarity of the Ecuadorian people and its Government with the fraternal people of Mexico and its Government in the face of the terrible earthquake that has struck them. Fortunately; the Mexican people throughout its history seems to have been able to draw strength precisely from such difficult tines. He wish Mexico a vigorous reconstruction in the face of this disaster.Forty years have elapsed since the horror of the Second World War confronted the international community with the inevitable need to unite the best efforts of peoples and of their Governments in order to organize a lasting peace.It is not easy to attain peace when political antagonisms  extremist ideologies and the very deep economic crisis of a considerable part of the world pose overwhelming problems every day. In certain circumstances  nothing seems easier than to resort to violence and war. Only a system of moral values to which mankind agrees can give a sure guarantee of peace and ensure the effectiveness of the organizations that seek it.The balance sheet of these 40 years of the world Organization yields results which  if not altogether satisfactory  are in any case positive. Many regional conflicts have been held in check. Effective vigilance over the sovereignty of nations has been strengthened. Contributions have been made to systems of co-operation for development and foundations have been laid for the promotion of respect for human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes.We are still far from having fully achieved the ideals of peace  progress and well-being. The United Nations cannot but reflect the tensions and contradictions within and among the States that it comprises. One cannot demand from the Organization results that exceed the contents of its problems or the tendencies of the human groups operating within the international community. Peace cannot be stable unless based on the just solution of existing problems. Hell-being cannot be obtained if there is no will to co-operate  both on the part of the developed and the poor countries. There can be no progress as long as people are denied the possibility of continuous improvement  which cannot take place if peoples' rights are denied in an authoritarian manner and if totalitarian imposition by the State is preferred to the free play of democracy.Regarding non-alignment  the climate of the present-day world is marked by confrontation. Two major ideological trends propose their own scale of values as being worthy of supremacy  and two styles - which  in turn  are two influences of universal scope - are vying for areas of domination. Faced with this phenomenon it is essential to have the presence of non-aligned countries  countries that  in fact  practice independence and autonomy that represents the essence of this historic stance. There such non-alignment is merely apparent and fails to reflect a deeply spiritual attitude on the part of the Governments forming the group  principles will be distorted and a position expected to have a moderating effect will become sterile. Because of such distortions  it risks becoming less serious and influential.Ecuador states once again that it is prepared to continue its policy' of friendship and understanding with all countries in the world. It considers that the differences in political nuances or ideological tendencies cannot constitute an insurmountable barrier to dialog and negotiation. In its relations with other States  and in Multilateral relations  it seeks that which brings unity and not division  that which brings agreement  and not dissent. He seek convergence and not divergence.I now turn to atomic explosions. Along the long and limitless road towards peace  atomic explosions for military purposes must be condemned. It does not matter where they take place  but it must be realized that those carried out in the South Pacific are a subject of particular concern to Ecuador  given its position within the region whose ecological balance may be most threatened. The Permanent Commission for the South Pacific  composed of Chile  Colombia  Ecuador and Peru  has repeatedly condemned such tests. My Government also supports the South Pacific Forum and its recommendation that a treaty establishing a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific be negotiated and adopted.On the subject of decolonization  the United Nations must be the forum where all the peoples of the world are represented. Hence  Ecuador has always supported the process of decolonization and the admission of new States to this forum  thus recognizing the right of all nations to belong to the world Organization and the importance of the United Nations achieving full universality. For all these reasons we would view with satisfaction the admission to the United Nations of the two Republics of Korea  jointly or separately  since the right to belong to the world Organization cannot be made contingent upon peoples being able to act as one.Concerning occupied territories  Ecuador has insisted upon  and will continue to insist upon the withdrawal of foreign forces from all territories which  directly or indirectly  are under occupation by foreign military forces. It is essential that the peoples and territories that are victims of foreign occupation in whatever continent regain the right to self-determination and to the exercise of their own sovereignty.In the matter of relations with neighboring countries  the Government of Ecuador  loyal to its traditional policy of unrestricted adherence to the rule of law in relations among States  and convinced of the need to contribute to the strengthening of a creative peace which allows all peoples to satisfy their legitimate aspirations for progress and well-being  renews its decision to encourage and strengthen friendly relations with the governments of neighboring countries in order to contribute to the well-being of their peoples  destined to have close ties  and to provide the climate for a just  peaceful and honorable solution to the territorial problem within a framework of mutual co-operation.Concerning the Beagle case  Ecuador views with great satisfaction the settlement achieved the peaceful solution of the Beagle Channel issue and congratulates Argentina and Chile for the clear example of Latin American brotherhood that they have given the continent by arriving at this agreement.Regarding geostationary orbit  Ecuador reiterates its position with respect to outer space  to the geostationary orbit  and the frequency spectrum. These resources must be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and for the good of all States  in particular for the development of the developing countries  and with due regard for the rights of the equatorial countries.With regard to the protection of human rights  Ecuador considers that all Member countries of the United Nations are obliged  by virtue of the San Francisco Charter  to protect and respect them. The universal nature of the norms proclaimed by the international community for the implementation of human rights cannot be distorted through selective or discriminatory criteria inspired by reasons of a political or ideological nature.In Ecuador of human rights are fully respected. The rule of law has been consolidated. The present Government takes its inspiration from Christianity as a doctrine that defends the equality and dignity of the human person and is directed towards the goal of the welfare of the people under the rule of freedom and justice.An important contribution to the international law of the sea has been made by the group of countries forming the organization of the South Pacific. The new Convention on the Law of the Sea enshrines the rights of the littoral States. This is clear progress towards the legal development of issues relating to the sea. These principles have been maintained by Ecuador and a large group of developing countries bordering the oceans.My country reiterates its resolve to defend Ecuadorian rights and interests in the context of this branch of international law which is developing so quickly. A few days ago the President of the Republic of Ecuador proclaimed that the continental shelf of Ecuador comprised the sea-bed and marine subsoil situated between the Ecuadorian territorial sea and the insular sea pertaining to the Colon archipelago up to a distance of 100 miles from the 2 500 meter isobath.Ecuador will continue to participate in the development of the new international law of the sea and of its related institutions. It will do so in the work of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-bed Authority and the International Tribunal  which it is attending as an observer.A country devoted to peace  Ecuador feels deep concern at the arras race in which the world is now involved. It recognizes the obvious sovereign right of States to safeguard their internal security  but this fundamental right can very well be reconciled with reasonable policies. There must be no toleration of an aims race which benefits only the arms dealers  while- the safety of mankind as a whole is endangered.In all international forums Ecuador has criticized the arms race  whatever its origin. Ecuador is a party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco which is intended to preserve Latin America as a nuclear-free zone.Disarmament is the goal which mankind must seek  but the least we can do is to seek arms limitation. It follows that Ecuador welcomes the proposal by the President of Peru  Mr. Alan Garcia Perez  to stem the arms race. But we believe that we must go beyond that objective towards real disarmament  above all in the most conflict-ridden regions of the world.Ecuador has traditionally respected fundamental human rights. It considers that the human being  and not the organization or the system  is the essential reason for the existence of the State  and his welfare the sole moral goal of governments.Consequently we have eliminated all forms of discrimination  which can be justified only on the grounds that some human beings are considered to have greater rights than others. No distinctions are made or tolerated in Ecuador for reasons of race  religion  sex  age  nationality or political belief. Women have the same rights as men  and if a woman freely chooses a function within society she does so because of her natural vocation and not because there are laws or policies that bar her from any activity or that limit her aspirations.The Government of Ecuador views with deep concern the increase in the illicit traffic in drugs  and in terrorism. These real crimes against mankind have become the scourge of our generation. Society finds itself threatened by terror as a weapon for domination or political destabilization  and by drug traffic as an -instrument for the organic and mental destruction of human beings and of young people in particular.Ecuador supported the General Assembly's declaration last year in which traffic in drugs has been defined as a crime against mankind  and it is ready to continue to give its support to the world Organization in promoting co-ordinated action by the international organizations and States against terrorism and the drug traffic  in relation to which commitments to fight these scourges were made by various Latin American Governments in the Quito Declaration of 11 December 1984.Terrorism has in recent days caused an international upheaval which deserves the unanimous condemnation of the international community. The daughter of the President of El Salvador  Mr. Napoleon Duarte  has become the victim of a kidnapping. The pressure of the crime of terrorism has gone so far as to involve the most personal feelings of a Latin American Head of State. Ecuador conveys to Mr. Duarte  President of El Salvador  its deepest feelings of solidarity. We strongly condemn this attempt to exert pressure on him. We are convinced that not only the action of the Government of El Salvador  but also the unanimous agreement of the international community in condemning this act will curb the action of terrorism so that the victories it attempts to obtain will in fact only lead to universal condemnation.The debt problem must be the shared responsibility of debtors and creditors. Ecuador has an open attitude to dialog and negotiation with the industrialized countries and the financial organizations. But it stresses the need for renegotiation to allow the essential leeway needed not only for the survival but also for the progress of the debtor countries.While Ecuador has brought to a successful close the process of debt renegotiation  in terms which allow for an acceptable development of our national economy  the only effective and permanent solution will have to come from a restructuring of the economic policies which  having been based on an ill-advised protectionism  are largely to blame for Latin America's growing current account deficit in the balance of payments.Latin America needs access to the market of the Eastern and Western industrialized countries for its exports  with the elimination of restrictive measures that prevent such access. The renegotiation effected by the Government of Ecuador commits approximately 30 per cent of current export revenues to debt amortization. This figure  while still high  nevertheless allows for the development and progress of the Ecuadorian people.Although Ecuador's acute problem has been substantially ameliorated  our international conscience is not dulled to the general problem of the debt and  above all  to the position of the South American countries. Consequently Ecuador supports and participates actively in the Cartagena Consensus group. For the peoples of Latin America the commitment of a disproportionate percentage of their export revenues to debt amortization is not a purely financial problem; it is a historic problem of survival.In the context of this dramatic crisis  Latin America's social  as well as its economic stability  and even the political outlook of its democratic regimes  constitute separate elements in this one basic problem.While it is not admissible for Ecuador to have any intent of declaring a unilateral moratorium  and still less to create debtor organizations directed to that end  Ecuador wishes to make clear to the Governments of the creditor countries  with complete frankness  the seriousness of the Latin American crisis.The contribution of the world Powers to the developing countries must be intensified. Multilateral development projects need to be extended and increased. It is essential that both the donor countries  and the recipient countries should be clearly aware of the fact that capital inflows  the transfer of technology  and the opening of credits and markets by the most developed countries  are all essential in order to promote the economic development and ensure the social peace of the developing countries. Withrespect to the Central American crisis and the Contadora Group  I wish to say that the serious breach of the peace which afflicts the Central American region is of continuing concern to the Government of Ecuador. Nothing that happens on our continent  much less something so distressing  can fail to be of concern to Ecuadorians. The Government of Ecuador considers that the enjoyment of true democracy in Central America is a sine qua non for the restoration of peace. It has therefore welcomed such electoral processes as those which took place in El Salvador last March and those about to take place next November in Guatemala. Moreover  it considers that the disarmament of the region is a necessity  since the imbalance of forces between States normally carries with it continuing threats to peace and constant breaches of the peace.In the same spirit  Ecuador has indicated that the time has come to resume the the conversations between the Government of El Salvador and the rebel forces  and it has given its approval to the proposal by President Ronald Reagan to encourage a dialog between the Sandinista Government and its opponents.In general  Ecuador believes that disputes between States must be resolved by peaceful means. Rational understanding  and not armed confrontation  is the way to solve differences. Consequently  the efforts of the Contadora Group are highly praiseworthy. Not only that means of dealing with the problem  but all those provided for under international law can be  and we hope will be  attempted in order to restore harmony in that afflicted region. To this end Ecuador looks with hope to the blossoming of the basic ingredient of peace  goodwill  that makes it possible to soften intractable intentions and overcome insurmountable obstacles.With respect to our work in the future  the Ecuadorian delegation wishes to stress  as it did last year  that the work of the General Assembly should focus on specific actions which may make it possible to achieve practical results  and seek above all every opportunity for understanding and points of agreement  rather than further deepening the differences  which  by increasing tension  or excesses  hamper the work of the Assembly.The action of States and of the United Nations must be based on the adoption of increasingly positive goals. We must move away from lofty rhetoric and concentrate on a modest but attainable objective. We must abandon the progressive dialectics of insult and instead stress common values. We must foreseen the primitive simplicity of fighting and make an act of faith in the effort of establishing brotherhood. In other words  we must seek harmony: that of man with nature  that of peoples among themselves  and that between nation and nation. The result of such an attitude will be progress and peace.Let us hope that in the last years of this century we may be able to witness the fact these ideals have become an objective shared by all the peoples of the earth."
"42",2133,"EGY",40,1985,"It gives me great pleasure. Sir  to begin my statement by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this session which coincides with the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. We are gratified by the great confidence placed in you through your election since we highly appreciate the close ties of friendship that bind our country to your great country  as well as your praiseworthy record in the promotion of the purposes for which the United Nations was established.I wish to express our sincere condolences and sympathy to the friendly people and Government of Mexico on the tragic calamity which has struck Mexico in the last few days while it was pursuing its efforts towards reconstruction and development. I am confident that I express the sentiments of all delegations present here when I reaffirm our solidarity with the friendly people of Mexico and reiterate that we stand by them while they are facing this distressing ordeal. In such moments  we are guided by the spirit and principles of the United Nations and by our belief that we all  irrespective of our national loyalties  stand in the same trench in the face of dangers and challenges.I speak from this rostrum on an important historical occasion  namely  the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. This Organization was established as an expression of the aspirations of the peoples of the world to begin a new era in which mankind could avoid the scourge of devastating wars and live happily in a climate of just and lasting peace that would enable it to gear its energies and resources towards tackling economic problems and achieving social progress and economic growth  free from despotism  oppression or aggression.The establishment of this Organization did not take place in a vacuum  nor was it an accidental occurrence occasioned by temporary circumstances. Rather  it was an outstanding landmark in the evolution of the international community  which had undergone bitter experiences during two world wars that flared up within half a century  and witnessed the development of sophisticated weapons of mass destruction and havoc  which reached a dangerous peak in the use of the atomic bomb. Such a state of affairs increased the people*' resolve to set up a new international system that would ensure against the outbreak of new wars that would inevitably cause the annihilation of all forms of life over a wide area and wipe out many features of civilization.For all these reasons  the occasion we are commemorating in these days acquires a special importance for Egypt as one of the 51 founding Member States that established the Organization and actively participated in drawing up its Charter and laying down its purposes and principles. This importance also derives from Egypt's geopolitical position at the heart of a region beset by conflicts and tensions. Cross its affiliation to regional and international groupings confronted with crushing  decisive issues which give rise to possibilities of peace or war  survival or death  economic growth or paralysis and deterioration. Thus  Egypt was a founding member of the League of Arab States  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.It is natural  therefore  that Egypt attaches high importance to the establishment of the United Nations  the development of its role and the enhancement of its effectiveness  it is equally natural that Egypt contributes intellectually and substantively to this required development in response to the vast changes that have swept over the arena of international relations since the establishment of the Organization. Some of these changes were: the breakdown of the international alliance which had won the Second World War and set up the United Nations; the unprecedented progress in the production of nuclear bombs and weapons of a destructive capability that far exceeded any imagination; and the changes in the structure of the international community as a result of the accession to independence of many countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America  bringing the total membership of the Organization to 159 countries - three times the original number of States within a short span of time. Moreover  the economic factor in international relations acquired added importance as economic issues and problems became the primary preoccupation of all States  large and small  developed and developing  rich and poor alike.It may not be appropriate here to make a thorough evaluation of the performance of the United Nations since its inception  to enumerate the positive and negative aspects of its activities or to analyze its achievements and setbacks. This topic needs a lengthy expose. Furthermore  much has been said about this issue on many earlier occasions. Suffice it to refer to the valuable report of the United Nations Secretary-General which he submitted on 4 September  Instead  I propose to concentrate on two major points which I believe to be pivotal in any serious attempt to launch the Organization into a new orbit in keeping with present-day challenges.The important thing is neither to look back on the past and weigh success against failure nor to censure or assign responsibility to one party or another. What is really necessary to look at the future   with all its potential fields of action and possibilities of change in order to arrive at a better formula for effective collective action  regardless of existing obstacles and restrictions. It will naturally be necessary to scrutinize the performance of the Organization in the past four decades too find out whether there is a specific pattern covering the fields in which the Organization has succeeded and those in which difficulties and impediments have prevailed. Our objective in such an exercise will be to reform the United Nations system and adapt it to evolving needs.The first point I wish to raise in this regard is that the basic problem facing States  individually and collectively  is the economic one. The issue here is not confined to the problems facing States in their foreign relations; the domestic economy of most States has become a heavy burden which cannot be ignored or underestimated. While all of us are confronted with this problem  the developing countries are the most hard-hit and feel that it is a flagrant injustice to be left to bear the burden of problems in the creation of which they had no say  not having contributed substantially to the establishment of the international system which brought about those problems.It is a source of grave concern that the economic situation in developing countries continues to deteriorate though much is repeatedly said about the need to rectify this situation and halting its deterioration. Thus the gap between hope and reality is continuously widening - a situation that does not augur well. Suffice it to mention here that the debts of developing countries at the end of 1984 totaled $US 900 billion and that this great increase in the volume of debts has been compounded by increasing servicing burdens on the export earnings of debtor countries coinciding with the stagnation of the official development assistance granted by rich to developing countries. Although the International Development Strategy set 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries as a target for official development assistance  this assistance  has stagnated in recent years at less than half the target set in the Strategy. In addition  the terms of international trade have deteriorated and protectionist practices in developed countries have increased. All those factors combined have created a serious situation the consequences of which cannot be limited to a particular international group but will inevitably affect the international system as a whole. Either we tackle this dilemma through a realistic  comprehensive formula that deals with the situation in all due seriousness or we shall all be subjected to more deterioration and loss.The picture is all the more grim when we look at the situation in sub-Saharan Africa  where problems resulting from drought  desertification and food shortages are worsening and have been compounded by the deterioration in Africa's terms of trade and the fall in its commodity prices. This situation poses a serious threat to the lives of millions of Africans  undermines the social fabric of their countries and shatters their legitimate aspirations to stable and continued development at a time when their main preoccupation is to secure the basic means of subsistence.We should all realize that the African continent suffered for a long time from colonization  exploitation and domination and that over the centuries it was deprived of a fair chance to develop its material and human resources or to utilize its energies in the interest of its peoples. The foreign Powers which ruled at that time regarded the continent as a source of raw materials and thus did not allow it to share the fruits of the resultant industrial and technological wealth.For all those reasons it is incumbent upon us to approach the situation in a new spirit that does not count profit and loss in rigid arithmetical terms or stem from narrow individual interests. Such a new spirit should take into account the fact that the interests of all of us are interrelated and that there can be no victor or vanquished in this struggle.Therefore we voice our full support from this rostrum for the call made by the 21st summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for the convening of a special General Assembly session at the ministerial level to discuss the economic problems of Africa  and the appeal to the international community to take the necessary measures to support the efforts made by the African countries towards undertaking economic reform  implementing development projects and staving off the threat of disasters.On the other hand  we appeal to the Governments of creditor countries  financing institutions and international banks to co-operate with debtor countries within the framework of an enlightened political dialog  free from pressure  with a view to reaching a lasting solution to the problem of indebtedness that will preserve the rights of developing countries  safeguard their aspirations in regard to food  basic health and educational services  and ensure their social and political stability.The second point I propose to touch upon briefly is the need to seek a genuine and radical solution to the problem of the lack of effectiveness of the United Nations in coping with the crises which threaten international peace and security. TO our mind  such ineffectiveness is not due to any shortage of resolutions adopted by the Organization and its various bodies in critical times. On the contrary  a host of resolutions have been adopted on all problems  despite recourse to the veto by some permanent members of the Security Council to bar the adoption of certainresolutions on specific issues  for reasons that are no secret to anyone. However  the resolutions adopted remain a dead letter  void of life  ineffective and useless. This undermines the true value of the Organization and weakens its position vis-a-vis the peoples directly involved in the issues. Moreover  it encourages these States which violate the provisions of the Charter to persist in their aggression and defiance of the collective will of the international community.Allow me in this context to refer to three issues by way of example  in the hope that we can examine them in depth in a manner that does not ignore the international status quo but  equally  does not lead to paralysis and helplessness before the attempts made by some States to impose their will by force.The first issue I should like to put before the Assembly is the Palestinian question  on which enough resolutions to fill large volumes have been adopted. However  the Palestinian people still live under the yoke of occupation and military rule in the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli settlements are still being established on their lands and restrictions are still being imposed on their movement and political  economic and cultural activities. Collective punitive measures are still being practised against the Palestinian people  and acts of violence and extremism are escalating. We believe that the key to a beginning to redressing this situation is the implementation of the resolutions that stipulate that the Palestinian people be allowed to exercise the right to self-determination and to establish their own State in the manner they choose  as well as the necessity to halt demographic changes in the occupied territories and to respect Arab  Islamic and Christian rights in Jerusalem.The second issue relates to the deteriorating situation in southern Africa as a result of the persistence of the racist regime of Pretoria in violating the rights of our brothers in Namibia  South Africa and the front-line States  despite the clear resolutions of the Security Council in this regard. It is neither conceivable nor  indeed  acceptable that the African majority of the population should continue to be subjected to the atrocities of this racist regime  which is escalating its practices of violence  suppression and terrorism and which does not hesitate to violate basic human norms and provisions of law  relying rather on brute force  as if it were living in the Dark Ages.The third issue is the war raging in the Gulf between Iran and Iraq and the resulting harm to the interests of both the warring parties and all neighboring countries. This situation gives rise to a state of unrest and tension which could be used as a pretext for large-scale foreign intervention - a development that could lead to a widening of the sphere of conflict and an escalation of fighting and destruction.I do not intend here to delve into the technical aspects of amending the Articles of the Charter or reinforcing the role of the Security Council and improving its rules of procedure. I would only state that the primary issue is one of political will  because  in the final analysis  the United Nations is what we want it to be and it is we who decide how it will fulfill its functions and carry out its mission.We should always remember that the objective is to reinforce this Organization and to lift the restrictions that curb its ability to respond to the increasing demands of the international family of nations in an age pervaded by unrest  uncertainty and insecurity  in which new generations are wondering what the future holds in store for them: comfort or pain  hope or despair  efficiency or paralysis.We firmly believe in the ability of mankind to choose and define targets when it has a clear vision before it  its priorities are sound and its intentions are good and when the dangers are obvious  since the will to live is capable of fashioning miracles.May God guide our steps and bless our actions."
"43",2203,"ESP",40,1985,"First  I should like to express the satisfaction and pride of the Spanish Government at seeing you. Sir  preside over this session of the General Assembly during which the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is being celebrated. Your long professional experience and well-known personal qualities constitute a guarantee that the work of this session will take place under this best possible conditions.I would also like to note the skill and mastery with which your predecessor  Ambassador Lusaka of Zambia  directed the previous session of the Assembly.Lastly  I should like to congratulate Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar for his professional qualifications and devotion to his duties.I come to this celebration in order to share with the great family of the United Nations wishes  but also fears   hopes  but also doubts  aspirations as well as frustrations. I come so that all of us together might evaluate for decades of experience and find paths towards the solution of the many problems that still confront us. I come  in short  in order to try to help make this Organization  the repository of so many hopes  more efficient  more dynamic and more own own.This shared celebration should result in a collective act of faith in the United Nations and in an expression of political will  so that our plans shall not remain  as they have on numerous other occasions  mere words filed away together with many other good projects in the archives of this Organization.It is now 40 years since  in a world leveled and impoverished by a war that brought death and destruction to all corners of the earth  a group of statesmen laid the foundations for a new international order whose basic pillar would be the United Nations. The drafters of the Charter did not limit themselves to drawing the historical lessons of the League of Nations  but wanted to give new juridical expression to the desire for brotherhood felt by all human beings.The United Nations was thus conceived as a center to harmonize efforts on behalf of international peace and security; to further friendly relations among peoples; to encourage international co-operation for the solution of economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems  and also to foster respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.The world turned hopeful eyes towards the city of San Francisco and to this attempt to organize the coexistence of nations around the ideals of peace  justice and freedom. But it did not take long for the crude realities of a political confrontation that divided the world into antagonistic camps to fall upon this historic moment and on the United Nations. In various parts of the planet conflicts fed by old and new rivalries once again flared up. Obstacles arose to plans for the ordering of international economic relations on more equitable foundations; while millions of persons continued to be subject to discrimination and persecution for political  religious or racial reasons.At the beginning of my statement I referred to the origins and purposes of the Charter  as well as its first clashes with reality because I belong to the generation of Spaniards who were born during the period when the United Nations was founded; because in our ""youngest youth""  in the words of Antonio Machado  a Spanish poet  we used as an instrument of struggle clandestine copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  distributing the to our fellow citizens as pamphlets that the existing authoritarian regime considered subversive; because for us fundamental human rights were not facts of life  as they were for some others of my generation around the world but something achieved in Spain by peaceful means. Yet for us those rights were not merely Utopian ideals or unattainable goals  and the proof of that is my presence here in this Assembly as President of the Government of Spain  chosen by the free and sovereign will of our people.For these reasons  it is no mere rhetorical expression or courtesy for me to reaffirm before this Assembly the firm commitment of the people and Government of Spain to defend the principles of the Charter and to strive to achieve its objectives. On the contrary  it is a profound conviction  born of the difficult but encouraging experience of our nation during the recent past.These features of our own experience in turn affect our external outlook  and is reflected in the position we adopt towards international problems.Our world is certainly very far from being the world that the drafters of the Charter wanted to build. The international community is passing through a period of uncertainty and confusion which seems to be testing the principles contained in the Charter and even bringing into question the very authority and efficiency of our Organization.We are all suffering from a climate of international tension exemplified by the persistence of international conflicts  and by the disproportionate accumulation of conventional arms and  above all  of nuclear arms  but also  as already stated in this debate  by the existence of serious economic and social imbalances and by violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms endured by millions of human beings. All this - war  poverty  discrimination - is immediately known in every corner of the world through the powerful communication media of present-day society  giving rise to disillusion among many and despair among even more.I do not intend to make an exhaustive analysis of each and every one of the problems of the international community  nor to make excuses for the responsibilities that any one of us might bear for them  and still less do I intend to rest content with declaratory statements full of good intentions but lacking in realism. I only wish to fulfill a responsibility to contribute to the joint meditation that the fortieth anniversary of this Organization - which has been  is and will continue to be whatever its Members as a whole desire - should stimulate among us.Xt is my belief that the three great problems which confront today's world probably would be even graver than they are if the United Nations did not exist. These three problems - the arms race the violation of human rights and the serious international economic crisis - represent challenges to the United Nations aims of peace  liberty and justice. Because of their scale and the complexity of their causes they concern the whole of icankind to a greater or lesser degree. Moreover  they are interrelated  so that we can affirm that peace is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for meeting the other two great challenges we face. On our capacity to meet these problems and find solutions for them will depend the judgement that history will render on the United Nations and - let us not deceive ourselves - on all of us  political leaders who collectively determine the course of our Organization.International detente  as the road to peace  depends upon disarmament  and the actual state of the arms race is more than discouraging  it is a situation which is shocking to any moral sense and is leading us towards collective suicide.The great Powers continue to pay little heed to the recommendations of the United Nations and are investing enormous sums in nuclear arsenals with an overkill capacity to destroy our planet. As if it were not enough to end human life once  we seem to be intent on accumulating sufficient weapons to destroy all traces of life on this planet several times over. On the other hand  many developing nations are endowing themselves with costly conventional armaments that far exceed their defense needs. Both groups of countries are ignoring the many voices crying out for the use of those resources for the eradication of poverty and hunger. He hope that the forthcoming Conference on Disarmament and Development will provide a powerful stimulus in this area.During its last session the General Assembly urged the United States and Soviet Governments to renew their arms control negotiations without delay or preconditions. Today it is fitting to express the satisfaction and relief of the international community at the reopening of these negotiations  whose results and implication go far beyond those of a simple bilateral dialog.In the unavoidable challenge of disarmament and arms control  much  in fact nearly all  remains to be done. Indeed  given the acceleration and increasing sophistication of the arms race  the road to disarmament seems longer than ever. Nevertheless  we cannot permit ourselves the least discouragement when dealing with our own survival and our legacy to future generations.The United Nations has not remained inactive in the face of this challenge. It has approved important agreements as a first step towards the goals we have set for ourselves. It has promoted the creation of large denuclearized zones; and it has served as a forum for multilateral negotiations that proceed slowly but steadily in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.We must insist once again that the steps already taken should be completed through the strong determination of the great Powers to arrive at significant agreements that will open the road to a new era of confidence and mutual security. These are essential and complementary conditions for establishing verifiable disarmament measures as a firm basis for detente.In addition to these structural problems  there are situations of conflict of a particularly serious nature. I will refer to only two of these  while stressing that this does not imply any lack of concern on the part of any of us  particularly my Government  over conflicts such as that between Iran and Iraq and occupations such as those of Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Namibia.The conflict in the Middle East  with its never-ending train of human suffering and its enormously destabilizing effect  continues any sign of finding a just and peaceful solution. Such a solution would have to be based on the withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967; on respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination  on the right of all nations in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.The Spanish Government follows with interest and hope the praiseworthy efforts now being made to open a path towards peace through dialog among the parties directly concerned  on the basis of the guidelines set by the relevant United Nations resolutions. We have publicly expressed our support for these initiatives.The Central American crisis continues to cast a destabilizing shadow over the whole region. The vigorous efforts of the Contadora Group have succeeded up to now in containing the conflict and avoiding its spread. Nevertheless  the deep roots of the crisis  that is to say  the unjust economic  social and political structures  made worse by the increasing trend to militarization continue to bring about a deterioration in the living conditions and in the security of the inhabitants of the region.In these circumstances  the Contadora Group needs  now more than ever  the committed support of the entire international community  and  in particular  that of the countries with special ties to the region  in the task of outlining a framework for coexistence in Central America that will guarantee the independence  territorial integrity  and relations of friendship and co-operation among all the countries of the area  as well as full freedom for their peoples.In this sense  it is promising to see the backing given Contadora by the four countries of the Lima Group  as well as the possibilities offered by the channels of co-operation already established between the Central American countries and the European Community  including Spain and Portugal.The second great problem confronting us is the systematic violation of human rights in a number of countries and the indifference of their leaders to the appeals from this Organization.At the same time  it must be recognized that the denunciations which have originated here have at times suffered from selectivity  and the discussions on the primacy of individual and collective rights have often concealed a struggle of ideological interests.But in many parts of the world  political convictions or religious beliefs are still grounds for persecution or exile  not to say torture or forced disappearance. The exploitation and lack of protection for workers  even child labor  continues to prevail in many places.Racial discrimination  one of the most odious affronts to human rights  is still a regular practice in many societies. In particular  the policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa has once again shown its most repressive side by causing further suffering to the majority of the population and carrying within it the seeds of regional destabilization.Our Organization  and with it the international community  must rise up with one voice to condemn unequivocally one of the most flagrant and masssive violations of human rights in our time. The measures recently adopted by a significant number of the members of the international community are practical proof of the importance given to this problem and of the need for attaining real advances. Only the disappearance of this institutionalized system of racial discrimination can restore human dignity to the majority of the South African population and ensure a future of peace and harmony in southern Africa.From this rostrum  I wish to appeal to the South African authorities to immediately and unconditionally free Nelson Mandela along with the other political prisoners  with a view to creating the minimum conditions for a dialog that might avoid impending disaster.Faced with the challenge of human rights violations  the United Nations has opened a new era in which it has been possible to establish international means for the promotion and defense of human freedom and dignity. Now  it is possible to hold States accountable for their actions.Spain can legitimately say that it is at the forefront of the countries that have freely agreed to submit themselves to these international controls  both of the United Nations and the even stricter controls of the Council of Europe.To defend human rights is also to protect citizens against terrorism  whose objective is none other than to eliminate coexistence and freedom. Like fascism  terrorism attempts to impose itself on democratic society by force. This new form of totalitarianism  which tramples equally upon the life and liberty of man  each day has a greater international element  and so our response to it must also be international.The international economic crisis continues to have harmful effects in many countries of the world  especially the least-developed nation?. The meager recovery of economic activity  and with it that of international trade  has not sufficiently involved large areas of the world. Neither has it permitted a significant reduction of the most serious problems faced by many industrialized countries and their economies that is to say  unemployment and technological obsolescence.The burdensome foreign debt of many developing countries is one of the major problems posed to the international community today. Together with natural disasters  such as when our hearts went out to our brothers in Mexico following the earthquake  there are also financial earthquakes. Of major importance is the debt problem of the debtor nations subjected as they are to overwhelming burdens. But it is also important for the industrial countries  since it leads to fragility in financial markets. It is important  finally  for the international economy as a whole.Developments which in little more than ten years have led to present difficulties are a complicated story. But it is worth-while to note that in the genesis for these problems  responsibility has been widely distributed. It is important to recognize that the problem of the debt is not an isolated phenomenon  rather that it forms an integral part of economic development in an interdependent world  and its solution  therefore  is a task for all countries  debtor and creditor countries alike.For the heavily indebted nations  their inevitable contribution to the solution of this problem must be centered on the development of policies of economic reform and adjustment. These imply austerity programs  but also the bringing up to date of productive systems and resources. These are thankless economic policies  I know them well  almost always besieged by those who are impatient and attacked with proposals which are as simplistic as they are deceitful. But these policies deserve our respect  encouragement and assistance. We should support them  especially when they are adopted by democratic governments which must with great effort seek means to overcome the crisis and maintain liberties which they have conquered at high cost. That respect and support must be expressed through effective co-operation.We must recognize that  however firm the determination of debtor nations to apply policies of adjustment  there is a limit beyond which undeniable aspirations for human dignity generate social tensions which become irresistible. It is necessary  therefore  that when these countries practice sound economic policies they may count on effective international co-operation to enable them to stagger their actions within tolerable limits  and at the same time to permit them to create a climate of hope for their peoples. The co-operation of creditor nations cannot be limited to dealing with financial problems on a case-by-case basis or to considering the debt problem in isolation.The fact is that the monetary  fiscal and commercial policies of the industrial countries directly and seriously affect the developing countries and condition their ability to pay.This may produce the paradox that the industrial nations maintain disjointed financial policies while by the pressure of external restrictions they force the debtor countries to fight to preserve their international solvency  sometimes at a very harsh social and political cost. It is even more unreasonable to ask the debtor nations to apply policies of structural change while the industrial nations increasingly resort to protectionism as a way of avoiding adapting themselves to the changing conditions of the world economy.Thus  the debt problem demands effort and discipline on the part of the debtor nations  but also requires from the industrial nations clear-cut  intensive co-operation far exceeding mere financial agreements on the renegotiation of liabilities.Spain  because of its relatively modest size economically  cannot hope to play a leading role in dealing with these problems  but it will not succumb to the temptation of irresponsible rhetoric. We believe that the existing difficulties must be overcome through international co-operation within an adequate time-frame and by taking fully into account all the interests involved.I can assure the Assembly that Spain  which  like other nations  has interests of its own in the issue  and has a deep understanding of the problems of the debtor nations and very close ties with some of them  is willing to participate in this co-operation and to stimulate it. To this end  we shall defend these points of view in all the international forums in which we participate and in forums in whichwe shall participate in the very near future  such as those of the European Community.This  in broad outline  is the disturbing picture that a rapid survey of the international scene reveals. This is not the world to which we aspire or in which the Charter of the United Nations has led us to believe. Nevertheless  this Organization has done much in the last 40 years for the peace of mankind and human progress.The judgment of world public opinion on the United Nations depends in great part on its contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. In this regard  it would be unjust to forget what the Organization has contributed in keeping situations of tension from degenerating into open confrontations or in limiting the effects of local conflicts. In the final analysis  the obligation of all States to justify their international actions in this forum increases the political cost of any behavior that is contrary to the spirit or the letter of the Charter.There are other arenas in which the work of the United Nations  seen in historical perspective  is impressive. Now that we are or the verge of commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  how can we fail to recall that the United Nations has been a protagonist of decolonization and that its influence has been decisive in accelerating that process?It is true that there are still questions pending  but in all of them this Organization has drawn up an appropriate framework for a solution  whether it be through the exercise of the right of self-determination or through the application of the principle of territorial integrity.One of the pending colonial questions directly affects my country. I refer to the ease of Gibraltar. Recently  Spain and the United Kingdom have taken an important step towards the definitive solution of the problem by concluding the Brussels Declaration  which provides for the opening of negotiations on all questions  including  therefore  the question of sovereignty. We are confident that we can thus put an end  in accordance with the directives of the United Nations  to an anachronistic dispute which  like others in the world no longer has any reason for existing between two nations united by their common membership in European institutions.Unfortunately  the decolonization effort has not been sufficient. Many countries have remained trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty  made worse on many occasions by the consequences of natural disasters. In this area too  the United Nations has made prodigious efforts through the establishment of funds and development programs  technical co-operation and humanitarian and emergency aid  which have benefited millions of human beings.The record of the United Nations  therefore  is not insignificant  but we must admit that compared with the enormous task that still lies ahead it has not responded fully to the hopes of the founders of the Organization or met the expectations of the peoples. This has brought about a certain devaluation of multilateralism as a method of ordering international society.It is paradoxical that in an increasingly interdependent world that needs international co-operation there is ever more insistent talk about the alleged crisis of multilateral channels and the United Nations is criticized  at times ruthlessly. This anniversary provides a good opportunity for analyzing the causes of the crisis and diagnosing which are due to a lack of will and which to structural deficiencies  so as to be able to introduce suitable remedies and necessary reforms.In order to make the principles of the Charter fully applicable the Organization would have had to be provided with much more comprehensive means. Instead  the Organization's capacity for action was strictly limited. This disproportion between objectives and the means given to the Organization is one of the constant sources of disenchantment and frustration among the world' public.The lack of real power on the part of the Organization could have been compensated for by fuller co-operation among the great Powers. But  after having reserved for themselves a privileged position in the Security Council  these have limited themselves in practice to using the Organization frequently as a marginal forum for political and ideological confrontation.Furthermore  as we near the objective of universality  the composition of international bodies has become more complex and heterogenous. Some countries find it difficult to accept this heterogeneity  which is a reflection of today's world  and criticize the action of specific organs or agencies because they do not correspond to their own interests or aspirations. But neither the policy of leaving seats empty nor the attempts to manipulate an international organization are constructive foundations for the future.The crisis of multilateralism thus has its origins in the interaction of very diverse and complex causes. We should not therefore cherish false hopes as to its rapid solution. Nevertheless  there is a great deal that each of us can do.All Member nations must develop a greater sense of their responsibilities towards the Organization  renouncing any unilateral interpretation of the principles of the United Nations. The permanent members of the Security Council have  moreover  a special responsibility in accordance with the role conferred on them by the Charter. Only improvement of the international political climate and greater co-operation  by the great Powers within the context of the Council will make it possible to lay the basis for re-establishing the authority of the United Nations.The subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies should reaffirm their original objectives so that an authentic differentiation of functions may allow the united Nations system to develop .all its potential in the cause of international co-operation.Finally  we shouU strengthen the authority of the Secretary-General to enable his to carry out fully the mission entrusted to him by the Charter. The joint appeal for the strengthening of the United Nations  which I recently signed  together with other Heads of States or Government  stresses the central importance of the Secretary-General by affirming that he ""should play an active role in the solution of international crises"" and that ""the conflicting parties should use his good offices in a constructive fashion and co-operate with him in mediation efforts"". Before concluding my speech  I think it necessary - although not without risk - to try to draw up a balance sheet. These first 40 years in the life of the United Nations have been  in my judgment  positive ones. Most of the shortcomings on which 1 have commented here are not the fault of the Organization itself  but rather of a lack of political will on the part of Member States  at times because of selfishness or a lack of solidarity  at other times because of indolence  and on not a few occasions because of a lack of trust. We should try to eradicate all these shortcomings. It is certainly true that in order to reach that goal we shall need a different world  but such a world will not be possible without determination on our part to overcome the setbacks of the past and not fall prey to discouragement. The very fact that the leaders of so many and such diverse nations have gathered here to engage in collective contemplation should help us objectively to pinpoint our successes and our failures.Let us prevent the phrase ""too little  too late"" from becoming the epitaph of all those institutions unable to give an adequate  timely and just response to the great problems of their time.We must force ourselves to understand the present with the concepts of today and not with those of yesterday  so that we can prepare for tomorrow. The united Nations should not be only a meeting place for prolonged deliberations on issues of current interest or much less a hospital for the fevers and infirmities of the international community. The United Nations should be  first and foremost  the place where solutions to our global problems and great plans for the future can be jointly worked out and put into practice through multilateral co-operation.In the past we have reacted to crises instead of foreseeing and preventing then. As a result  many of our problems today sees insoluble or insuperable. In the future  we should strive to ensure that our organization is not United to being a safety net in tines of danger  but that it also - and above all - serves as the center for long-tern efforts to resolve the pressing problems and challenges of a world which is in transition and becoming increasingly interdependent every day.Today we face the challenge of having to respond to ambitious objectives with limited means. TL« forces of reason and solidarity must prevail over those of violence and selfishness if we do not wish to be denounced by the men and women of tomorrow for having been blind to the opportunities offered to us by technological advances and for having used them for destructive ends rather than for the building of a better world.Nevertheless  realism obliges me to insist that the only catalyst capable of bringing about the positive synthesis of these extremes is the political will of the States Members of this Organization. The time has come to expect less and contribute more.In a world where the instruments of peace are few and fragile  the united Nations  with all its deficiencies  is our best hope. Let us ensure that this fortieth anniversary will transcend ceremonies  proclamations and good intentions and that from it will emerge a true commitment to advance with determination towards universal peace  prosperity  justice and freedom.I assure this Assembly that the people and the Government of Spain will spare no effort in this common enterprise  to which we are all summoned."
"44",2275,"ETH",40,1985,"At the outset I should like  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and on my own behalf  to congratulate you? Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of this very important session of the General Assembly. I wish you every success  and assure you of the fullest co-operation of my delegation in the discharge of the onerous responsibilities entrusted to you.I should like also to take this opportunity to express my delegation's appreciation to the outgoing President  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the able manner in which he guided the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I also feel particularly happy to express my admiration for the diligence and skill with which our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  is managing the affairs of the United Nations.Forty years ago the vast majority of mankind collectively succeeded in bringing an end to the madness and horror of nazism and fascism. Beginning with the aggression against my country in 1935  these forces of darkness had spread death and destruction on an unprecedented scale throughout Europe  Africa and Asia.Embittered by this horror and inspired by the noble ideal of saving ""succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  the nations of the world entered into a covenant pledging to beat their swords into ploughshares  and established an international organization to harmonize their actions. The United Nations Charter is  thus  an embodiment of this commitment and of the deepest aspirations of mankind for peace  social progress and justice.Since its founding  the United Nations has  without doubt  accomplished much. It has been instrumental in the acceleration of the decolonization process and has also contributed to the strengthening of global understanding and international co-operation in such diverse fields as economic and social development  the respect for human rights and the rights of peoples  and the elimination of all forms of discrimination.However  given our immense capacity for collective endeavors  the wide gap that still exists between the achievements of the United Nations and our collective aspirations as enshrined in the Charter leaves no room for complacency  particularly in the present perilous international situation.Mass poverty and the specter of nuclear annihilation continue to constitute formidable challenges to our common resolve and goals of global peace and prosperity. Lack of trust among nations  the desire to achieve national objectives by the threat or use of force  and indifference to the lawless acts of some not only have run counter to the commitment we have undertaken in the Charter of the United Nations  but have actually become sources of global tension.The retreat from multilateralism by some States has rendered the United Nations less effective in resolving conflicts and in arresting the ever-deteriorating economic and social conditions  particularly of the developing countries. No less ominous is the trend to undermine the effectiveness of multilateral institutions by actual or threatened withdrawal from importantinternational organizations  such as the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Such maneuver obviously constitute an assault on the entire United Nations system and on the very concept of multilateral co-operation.It is  of course  unfortunate that some consider the united Nations to be a mere forum for sterile polemics  where important and pressing international political  economic and social issues continue to appear perennially on the agenda of the General Assembly without any prospect of their resolution. Such views  I believe  underestimate the achievements and potentials of the .United Nations.In this context  we note with gratification the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption in 1960 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  a Declaration which stands as a living testimony to what the United Nations can achieve. The adoption of this Declaration was and still is an act of justice to those who have been and are still denied their inalienable rights to freedom and independence. By invoking this historic Declaration millions of subjugated peoples have been able to attain their independence and join the community of free nations.One significant and important exception is  of course  Namibia. During the past four decades  the United Nations has adopted numerous resolutions on Namibia. But so far it has failed to dislodge the racist regime of Pretoria from its illegal occupation.Indeed  the United Nations plan for Namibia  as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  remains unimplemented as a result of the obduracy of the racist regime and the duplicity of some of its Western sponsors. By introducing extraneous issues into the implementation of the plan and by installing an illegal puppet administration in Windhoek  the forces of racism and imperialism have blocked the peaceful transition of Namibia to independence. In this connection  we vigorously condemn the so-called policy of linkage and call upon its proponent to abandon this self-serving stratagem and work with the United Nations in favor of the speedy decolonization of Namibia.In South Africa  the struggle of the oppressed people has today reached-a crucial stage. The fury of the masses has exploded into popular action. The flame of freedom has been set ablaze.In the hope of extinguishing this flame  the racist regime has  none the less  responded with its all too familiar brutality. With the imposition of a state of emergency  the regime appears bent on leaving no stone unturned in its vain attempt to contain an uncontrollable situation. We are certain that the trepidation of Pretoria's fascist regime and its resort to naked force will only fuel the fire to stoke the flames of freedom and equality.Already  the oppressed people in South Africa and Namibia are intensifying the armed struggle under the leadership of their liberation movements  the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  respectively. We know for sure that the beginning of the end of the racist regime is well under way. But we equally recognize that  unless the international community acts more forcefully and decisively now  much blood is bound to be spilled in southern Africa. Pretoria will  of course  not be the only one to be held responsible for this crime against humanity. Those Western Powers that have aided and abetted racism for so long and continue to do so now will have to share the blame and responsibility.To escape this responsibility  the Western Powers in general and the United States Government in particular must disengage and be seen to be disengaging themselves from the genocide in South Africa. They must also impress uponMr. Botha that the policy of ""constructive engagement"" was not intended to destructively engage the defenseless people of South Africa with bayonets  bullets and bazookas. Disengagement from Pretoria must  therefore  be immediate and total. This  I submit  is the moral imperative of the time.In this regard  we are encouraged by the popular movement in North America and Western Europe for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners  such as Nelson Mandela  and in support of sanctions against South Africa. Without the release of Nelson Mandela and other representatives of the Sou tit African people  there can be no effective political process in South Africa and no bridge can be built across the racial chasm.As regards sanctions  we are discouraged by the hesitant and token measures so far taken by certain Western Governments and their attitude of selective morality. South Africa depends on the economies of the Western States  which are in a position to say  and have a moral obligation to say  to Pretoria  ""we are not prepared to finance apartheid"" which  I submit  is an outgrowth of nazism and fascism. The purpose of sanctions is to avert a racial blood-bath in southern Africa.Already the threat of financial sanctions and disinvestment has driven the leadership in Pretoria to think about reforms. But apartheid cannot be reformed. It has to be dismantled completely  and for that the pressure has to be continued. We therefore call upon Western Governments to join us here and now in the United Nations in imposing comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa through the instrumentality of the Security Council.History has demonstrated that freedom  equality and independence do not come without sacrifice. The oppressed in southern Africa know this and  for their freedom and dignity  are prepared to sacrifice and are sacrificing even their lives  let alone the few marginal benefits that result from the merciless exploitation of their resources.From this rostrum I pay a tribute and homage to the millions in Namibia and South Africa who have sacrificed so much for so long to bring closer the day of freedom and independence. Their cause is just and their sacrifices shall not be in vain. In Ethiopia  indeed in the whole of Africa  are resolved to assist the armed struggle and the campaign to isolate Pretoria until Namibia accedes to independence and a just and democratic society is established in a united South Africa  with the current leadership swept on to the rubbish heap of history. Socialist Ethiopia also reaffirms its militant solidarity with the front-line and other neighboring-States in their heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught and resist the pressure of racist Pretoria.For close to four decades armed conflicts in the Middle East have not only claimed a huge toll of lives and destruction of property but have also been sources of grave danger to international peace and security. An end to the blood-letting in the area can only come about with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all territories occupied since 1967 and the exercise by the suffering Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination and to a sovereign and independent statehood.Another essential ingredient for peace in the Middle East is scrupulous respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and all other States in the region. In this connection  Ethiopia condemns the recent Israeli aggression against Tunisia and its deliberate extension of the Middle East conflict to the Maghreb.Other international problems which still engage the attention of the international community are the Iran-Iraq war and the situations in Western Sahara  Afghanistan  the Korean peninsula  Kampuchea  Central America and Cyprus. Ethiopia's position on all these issues has been repeatedly expressed in the past from this same rostrum and needs no further elaboration. Nevertheless  I should like to reaffirm our solidarity with the Nicaraguan people and Government in their just struggle to defend their revolution and sovereignty from imperialist and externally-supported elements and express our full support for the Contadora peace process.Our solidarity also goes to the Korean people  who are striving for their peaceful reunification. We are convinced that the withdrawal of foreign forces and the dismantling of foreign military bases in the peninsula will go a long way to accelerate the process of national reunification.Our persistent expression of concern at the aggravation of international tension and our insistent call for the peaceful resolution of international conflict stem partly from knowledge of the possibility that any local  regional or international dispute could eventually lead to a nuclear confrontation. Nuclear weapons  as we all recognize  have made the world an unsafe place to live in. And yet no single issue has more completely failed to meet even the minimal aspirations of the peoples of the world than that of disarmament.The desire o£ imperialism to achieve military superiority under the guise of nuclear deterrence has surely exposed mankind to the danger of global nuclear holocaust. The so-called strategic defense initiative  contrary to the argument of its proponents  would undoubtedly markedly increase the risks of nuclear war. Every step in the sophistication of such weapons continues to accelerate man's journey to doomsday. With the nuclear arms race  not only have the sense of insecurity and the risks of nuclear war been increased but  as a result of the huge human  financial and material resources absorbed by arms production  the progress and prosperity of much of humanity has been unjustly forfeited.We are  however  gratified to note that the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States have at long last agreed to meet in Geneva to resume serious bilateral negotiations on questions related to space and nuclear arms. We hope that the negotiations will open the way for an effective disarmament agreement.We reiterate our steadfast position in favor of the denuclearization of Africa and the maintenance of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace as part of the disarmament process in general and the control of the spread of nuclear weapons in particular. In this respect and in line with the long-standing decisions of the United Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  as well as those of the Organization of African Unity  we call once again for the elaboration of a treaty on the denuclearization of Africa and for the speedy convening of the conference on the Indian Ocean.I should like now to turn to the very serious economic and social situation facing much of humanity. It is a fact of contemporary international life that the world economy is becoming more and more interdependent  requiring the intensification of co-operation among nations on a mutually beneficial basis. At the present time  however  world economic relations are unfortunately characterized by inequalities and imbalances to the disadvantage of the developing nations. The incessant and just call of the developing countries for the establishment of a new international economic order has so far been neglected and their efforts have been frustrated by the few nations which benefit from the existing lopsided relations. Despite such resistance  the world community should none the less strive to bring about international co-operation in establishing a just and equitable international economic order. Co-operation implies a sense of shared responsibility for human welfare and an unswerving commitment to human solidarity. Failure to achieve global co-operation for the betterment of mankind will undoubtedly result in a grim alternative  the alternative of more rigid  fragmented and power-dominated international economic relations.In this context  it is disturbing to note that the situation of the least developed countries  far from being ameliorated  has further deteriorated  largely owing to the devastating impacts of the international economic crisis and recurrent natural disasters. Although some donor countries have increased their assistance since the adoption of the Substantial New Program of Action  its volume has been so insufficient and its distribution so uneven that it has failed to enable the least developed countries to achieve a minimum degree of performance in economic and social development as envisaged in the Program.The accelerated  effective and full implementation of the Program during the remaining part of the decade  I submit  is a commitment that the international community has entered into and from which it cannot shy away.As is well-known  most of the least developed countries are in the African continent whose already critical economic condition has been further exacerbated by the unfavorable world economic environment  characterized by the collapse of commodity prices  the spread of protectionism  the decline in official development assistance and the increasing burden of external indebtedness. Moreover  the fragile economies of African countries have also been hard hit by the prolonged drought and other natural calamities as well as by the alarming pace of desertification.While this economic and social crisis of Africa has fortunately drawn the attention of the international community  Africa itself has set out long-term  medium-term  and short-term strategies at the national  sub-regional and regional levels  not only to cope with the emergency needs but also to lay the foundation for an internally generated and self-reliant process of development.Much of Africa's efforts and resources have to be complemented by that of the international community  however  and the twenty-first Assembly of Heads of state and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has called for the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly  both to sensitize further the world community and to mobilize additional resources. African leaders have also called for the convening of an international conference to search for ways and means to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by many African States. We have every confidence that those calls will receive the favorable response they so rightly deserve from the international community.While referring to the economic crises in Africa  I cannot but make some brief remarks about the situation in my own country. I have  of course  to preface my remarks by expressing the deep and heartfelt gratitude  of the Ethiopian people and Government  to all those Governments  to the United Nations system  to intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations  to the relief workers  theartists and the media  indeed to all men and .women of goodwill who have so generously given us-assistance to save the lives of the drought victims in Ethiopia. Without their help and assistance  thousands would have perished for lack of food and adequate medical care.In this connection  a sincere word of thanks is due to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations and to all the heads of the agencies within the United Nations family  indeed  to all those indefatigable international civil servants for all they have done to give life and hope to millions of my compatriots. At this juncture  I would be remiss in my duty if I were to fail to express Ethiopia's gratitude to Mr. Bradford Morse and his colleagues in the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa and to Mr. Kurt Jansson  the united Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Emergency Operations in Ethiopia  whose unparalleled contributions and compassion have strengthened our faith in both the Unite.3 Nations and in humanity at large.While relief assistance and logistical support from the international community will have to continue for the immediate future  I have to stress that attention and assistance must now be focused more on how best to avoid similar tragedies in the future. This of course  leads us to the question of rehabilitation and long-term development.For its part  the Ethiopian Government has already mapped out strategies for an integrated rural development  including the voluntary settlement of people from drought-prone areas to more fertile  but sparsely populated parts of the country. Mobilizing the human  material and financial resources at its disposal  the Government has so far settled over half a million people in the more fertile parts of the country. Furthermore  the Ethiopian Government has already determined that food production and the rehabilitation of agriculture will be given high priority in the nation's development efforts. All these plans will  undoubtedly  require resources  of various kinds  which we do not possess in adequate amount. Much as we are determined to make the present tragedy the last in our history  we dare hope that the international community will help us in this noble endeavor by matching its humanitarian relief assistance with increased support for rehabilitation and development.At a time when the Ethiopian people and Government have been engaged in a massive campaign to contain and indeed eliminate the consequences of drought  an operation was set in motion by Israel  with the connivance and participation of the regime of former President Nimeiry  to lure and forcibly abduct members of the Ethiopian Falasha community to Israel. The Falashas  who have lived among their Ethiopian compatriots for thousands of years and who have no connection with Israel whatsoever  were uprooted from their original habitat and are now living in a land with which they have no cultural  geographical  historical  religious or anthropological links. Discriminated against and totally isolated from the Israeli society  they now lead a strange and miserable life in Israel. From this rostrum  I therefore call upon the United Nations and the international community to help us in the immediate and unconditional repatriation of our Ethiopian compatriots  to live in dignity  in the land of their birth where they rightfully belong.In connection with the plight of children  I am happy to inform this Assembly that the Ethiopian Government is fully committed to realize the goal of universal immunization by the year 1990. Already a trial immunization campaign is under way in Addis Ababa in which most of the children under the age of two have been immunized. This campaign will be expanded in a phased manner throughout the country. In commending the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and their executive heads for their efforts in this regard  I should like to call upon the international community to increase its assistance to Member States and to the agencies involved.Regarding the status of women  one of the most productive segments of our society  again  Ethiopia recognizes that its revolution would not he complete  and indeed  would be less deserving of that name without the full and effective participation of our women in the development process. We therefore welcome the successful conclusion of the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women held recently in Nairobi and the adoption by consensus of the Forward Looking Strategies.Over the past 40 years  the United Nations has traversed a long and difficult path and we can all be proud that our Organization has survived  and has even thrived in some respects. Its membership has grown threefold  while the network of organizations within it and the variety of activities undertaken by it have greatly expanded. For us this underlines the fact that the United Nations remains the last hope of mankind and the sole universal forum for multilateral efforts in the search for solutions to common problems.Although the past performance of the United Nations leaves much to be desired  its failures cannot be ascribed to shortcomings in the structure and function of the Organization. The strength and weakness of the Organization corresponds to the support which its Members are ready or reluctant to give it. Our task today should  therefore  be one of introspection. We should also utilize this occasion to rededicate ourselves to the noble objectives of the United Nations. We have to strive that the future which we will bequeath to our children and grandchildren will be markedly different from the past we had to endure.Let us  therefore  march forward together with the United Nations for a better world  and in the meantime  the struggle continues."
"45",2321,"FIN",40,1985,"It is most appropriate  Sir  that at its fortieth session the General Assembly should be presided over by a diplomat who is as experienced in international affairs and as skillful in the business of the United Nations as you. I wish to congratulate you warmly and to assure you of the operation of the delegation of Finland in your challenging task. May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to our outgoing President  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  fog his distinguished service.I wish to take this opportunity to express  on behalf of the people and Government of Finland  our deepest condolences to the people and Government of Mexico for the devastating natural catastrophe that recently occurred in their country.In commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and  at the same time  the thirtieth anniversary of Finland's membership  my Government wishes to reaffirm its full support for the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the strengthening of the United Nations as an organization. We are grateful for the annual report of the Secretary-General  in which he wisely emphasizes that international co-operation is not a choice for the nations of the world  but a necessity. We entirely concur.For 40 years  the United Nations has stood at the center of mankind's aspirations for a more secure and just world order. For 40 years  the United Nations has fulfilled its main task - that of maintaining international peace and security. While there have been many local and regional conflicts  the world has been spared a conflict on the scale of the Second World War.In the course of the past four decades  economic and social problems have come to occupy an increasingly prominent place among global concerns. One after another peoples that were not free in 1S45 have assumed their right to self-determination. The membership of the united Nations has more than tripled. Today  the agenda of the Organization reflects the foremost concerns of the majority of its present membership.While the world has changed greatly in the past 40 years  so have the challenges mankind faces. There is the challenge of halting and reversing the mindless arms race  particularly in nuclear arms. There is the challenge of new frontiers of human endeavor  above all that of outer space. Space holds great promise for mankind  yet it may become an arena of unprecedented peril. There is the challenge of saving our environment  maintaining the natural infrastructure without which human life on Earth is impossible. And there is the challenge of survival and development  of ensuring basic needs and better standards of living for the hundreds of millions who today live in misery  while these challenges are awesome  mankind is in a better position than ever before to meet them. A new kind of interdependence among nations and issues  as well as rapid technological advances  represent a potential that should be tapped for the benefit of all.The commemorative session offers a timely opportunity to discuss these and other common concerns of mankind and to assess the role of the United Nations in managing them. As the only universally representative forum  the United Nations system is in a unique position in this regard. The presence of many Heads of State or Government at that session testifies to the importance they attach to such an opportunity. The President of Finland is one of them.Speaking about the world situation from this rostrum one year ago  I saw little reason for optimism. Uncertainty and even hostility characterized international relations. Since that time  the atmosphere has improved and dialog has been rediscovered. This gives us reason to expect a positive change.The Government of Finland has welcomed the Soviet-American talks on nuclear and space arms begun in Geneva earlier this year. These talks between the two Powers with preponderant military might offer the best chance of curbing the arms race in those areas where it matters most for the preservation of peace - indeed  for the very survival of mankind. They should  as the mandate says  result in effective agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in space  terminating it on earth  limiting and reducing nuclear arms and strengthening strategic stability.Arms control efforts are an integral part of international politics. Periods of reduced confrontation have been more congenial to arms control efforts. Impulses originating at the highest political level have often been necessary to narrow differences in views and to prepare the ground for negotiations. The meeting of the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva in November is  in our view  a welcome opportunity for dialog in the interests of peace and international security.Only a few days ago  at the Third Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  an overwhelming majority of Member States reaffirmed their conviction that the Treaty is the most important instrument in the pursuit of basic security interests of the international community. The Final Declaration approved unanimously by the parties to the Treaty confirms that its three main goals remain valid: preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons  developing the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and working towards nuclear disarmament.While the responsibilities of those who possess nuclear weapons are great  international security is also a collective responsibility. The United Nations Charter and the Organization founded upon it are our joint recognition of that fundamental fact.The broad concept of security enshrined in the Charter finds regional expression in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The recent meeting in Helsinki commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Final Act demonstrated  at a high political level  the continued commitment of the signatory States to the CSCE process. One subject of discussion at the tenth anniversary meeting holds particular promise for lessening the risk of military conflict in Europe. The Stockholm Conference needs to show that militarily significant confidence- and security-building measures are achievable. That would make it possible to broaden its horizons to include an even more ambitious goal  that of curbing armaments on the continent with the heaviest concentration of weapons. The CSCE process provides for all the participating States an important forum in which to pursue a policy of co-operation as outlined in the Helsinki Final Act. Finland has consistently given its active support to these endeavors and  in so doing  served its own interests as well. In its immediate vicinity  the region of northern Europe  Finland will persevere in its efforts to maintain basic stability. Consolidating the absence of nuclear weapons from the territories of the Nordic countries through the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone would make a signal contribution to that stability.Among the challenges of our time the use of outer space is a far-reaching and complex issue. Finland deeply believes in the goal expressed in the space Treaty of 1967; space should be used for peaceful purposes to benefit mankind as a whole. My Government has consistently supported the work on outer space that has been carried out within the United Nations system over the years. Now that new technologies are making the economic utilization of space even more attractive and now that more countries  including mine  are interested in these possibilities  the time has come to think about a more comprehensive approach to the use and management of this resource. This should most properly be undertaken under United Nations auspices.At the same time  there is a growing risk that outer space may become a new arena for military competition. Finland is gravely concerned over such an eventuality. It was most welcome that the General Assembly last year came to an agreement which provides the basis for considering within the Conference on Disarmament the question of preventing an arms race in outer space. In addition  the United States and the Soviet Union have committed themselves at their negotiations in Geneva to seeking agreements on this issue.*Co-operation in the field of environmental protection has developed in an encouraging manner during recent years. The United Nations Environment Program has since its foundation done valuable work in the field of environmental protection. Its role as the main organization responsible for United Nations activities in this field should be further strengthened. But  although the challenge is now better understood  the threat has not abated. In Europe valuable conventions have been concluded relating to the reduction of long-range trans-boundary air pollution and to the protection of the marine environment. In other regions of the world also  agreements have been concluded. There is a close interdependence between economic development and the state of the environment. No country can afford to ignore the deterioration of the ecological infrastructure. The Government of Finland urges the adoption  unilaterally  bilaterally and multilaterally  of stringent measures to save our common environment. The environment is a shared responsibility.The situation in South Africa is rapidly deteriorating. Violence and bloodshed are increasing. The state of emergency recently proclaimed by the South African Government has intensified the conflict between the Government and the majority of the South African people. Only the abolition of apartheid  together with the recognition of the civil and political rights of all South Africans  can provide the basis for a peaceful and democratic evolution of South African society. Demands for the intensification of pressure against South Africa have been repeatedly made. This was again reflected in the recommendations included in Security Council resolution 569 (1985). It is essential that the Security Council decide on effective mandatory sanctions against South Africa.At the same time  the international community as a whole has an urgent need for concerted action to secure an end to apartheid. It is our wish that the draft resolution on this issue to be introduced during this General Assembly session will receive the unanimous support of Member States. In March this year  the Nordic Foreign Ministers decided to strengthen and expand the Nordic Joint Program of Action against South Africa adopted in 1978. New measures are at.present being discussed among the Nordic Governments. A revised program will be adopted at the next meeting of the Foreign Ministers  in October. On the part of the Government of Finland  further measures to increase pressure against the South African Government have been under fresh review  and new legislation to this end is shortly be introduced. The Finnish Government has also decided to widen significantly its co-operation with the members of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference so as to help the countries of the region to become less dependent on South Africa. Our direct and indirect assistance to the liberation movements and oppressed people of South Africa and Namibia will also be further increased.At this moment there is a special reason to re-emphasize that Namibia is a unique responsibility of the United Nations. Only a week ago South Africa committed an armed invasion of Angola  apparently in order to frustrate the efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978).Finland welcomes the unanimous condemnation  in resolution 571 (1985)  by the Security Council of this act of aggression against a sovereign country. Earlier in June  after a lengthy pause  the Security Council reaffirmed the United Nations Plan for the Independence of Namibia in its resolution 566 (1985). The resolution confirmed the unconditional commitment of the international community to the Plan. The Council also condemned South Africa for its refusal to abide by the decisions of the Council  and warned South Africa that sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter would be imposed if it persisted in its policy of illegal occupation of Namibia  m this anniversary year it is for the united Nations to make a firm commitment to implement its Plan  as universally accepted. The General Assembly  in its resolutions  can do nothing less than send a clear  effective and unequivocal message to South Africa on an early independence of Namibia without further pre-conditions.The Government of Finland remains convinced that the basis for a comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict lies in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel must withdraw from Arab territories occupied since 1967. Acquisition of territories by force is inadmissible. The right of Israel and all other states in the area to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must be guaranteed. Furthermore  provision must be made for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to national self-determination. This presupposes the right of the Palestinians and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as the most significant representative of Palestinian national aspirations  to participate in negotiations on their own future within a comprehensive solution to the conflict.Finland has given its support to proposals and initiatives that contribute to a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East through negotiation. We hope that the latest initiatives will speed up the process towards a negotiated settlement.My Government is greatly distressed at the continued violence in Lebanon  The unique opportunity presented by withdrawal of Israeli forces did not bring about a credible ceasefire between the internal parties in southern Lebanon  nor did it restore the authority of the Lebanese Government in that region. We believe that agreement between the warring factions is the only way to save Lebanon's independence and sovereignty. The territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries must be strictly respected.By taking a balanced and conciliatory position on the various controversial issues in the Middle East  Finland maintains good relations with all parties concerned. A tangible expression of our policy towards the Middle East is the contribution which Finland is making to united Nations peace-keeping activities in that area.The United Nations and its peace-keeping operations play a vital role  often under difficult circumstances  in creating favorable conditions for a peaceful political solution. In order to be successful  peace-keeping operations require an authorization given by the Security Council - an authorization which is implementable - and full co-operation of the parties concerned. The incident last June where Finnish soldiers of the united Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were taken hostage raises fundamental questions of principle. A new effort to work out unambiguous and realistic guidelines covering all aspects of united Nations peace-keeping operations should be made.In Central America  a lasting solution to the problems can only be arrived at through dialog and negotiation based on the priorities and concerns of the States of the region  their sovereignty and their territorial integrity. Finland supports wholeheartedly the efforts of the Contadora Group toward a peaceful and comprehensive solution. We welcome the increasing support for the Contadora process elsewhere in Latin America.Persistent problems of development remain on our agenda. Despite efforts by the international community during more titan three decades  the plight of many poor countries has not been eased. Difficulties accumulate upon the poorest of the poor  making survival  not development  their major challenge. Changing this trend is our collective responsibility.The economic crisis in Africa is a tragic demonstration of the severity of these problems. Millions are still faced with famine and death. World Bank forecasts suggest that even in the most favorable circumstances  per capita growth in Africa w<ll be negative until at least 1995. This outlook is a challenge to the entire international community. Present policies are simply not enough.Any significant improvement requires concerted action. All should contribute to efforts aimed at creating an international economic environment more conducive to policy reform and sustained development. The developing countries themselves bear the main responsibility for their own development and for ensuring the efficient use of the resources at their disposal. This notion is one of the cornerstones of the Third International Development Strategy and has been repeatedly acknowledged by the developing countries themselves. The role of the industrialized countries is to support the efforts of the developing countries by providing adequate assistance. Above all  the flow of concessional assistance to the developing countries is more important than ever.In 1977  I was able to declare from this rostrum that my Government had decided to double the gross national product share of our official development assistance funds during the period of five years. That pledge was kept  and in 1984  for the first time  Finland reached the average level of development assistance among the countries of the Organization for ISconoraic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In July of this year  the Government of Finland took a policy decision by which it committed itself to substantial increase in its official development assistance in 1986 and 1987  with a view to reaching the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by the end of this decade. This decision is fully reflected in the budget bill now before our Parliament. My Government is backed in this matter by an active public opinion.Increasing the volume of aid is necessary  but it is not enough. All aid must be judged by the results it produces. The primary purpose of development co-operation is to achieve sustained economic and social progress in recipient countries. Other motives must be subordinated to this primary concern. An international re-commitment to this principle is called for. More can be achieved with the resources invested in development co-operation. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and its recent achievements give ample evidence of this. It is the responsibility of donors and recipients alike to ensure that these resources are used effectively.A new and integral approach is needed  one which takes population  natural resources  the environment and technology into account in the process of development. Human resources  the key element of sustained development  urgently need increased attention. The administrative and absorptive capacities of the developing countries must be strengthened in order to help them manage their own development.The process of development is basically the same in all societies. The economy can be developed only step by step. There are r.c easy shortcuts to higher levels of well-being  in the first place  a people's basic means of livelihood must be assured and sustained. This requires that priority be given to food production  education and health. It is encouraging to note that many developing countries have adopted this approach as a basis for their own development policies.The world is living through an age of rapid technological change  through a new technological revolution with profound consequences for all societies. These new technologies pose new challenges and open up new prospects also for developing countries. The latest achievements of technology make it possible to adopt modes of production which cause less social and ecological strain than the conventional technologies of industrialized societies. It is our common responsibility to ensure that developing countries can benefit from technological advances and that they can avoid repeating certain negative features of development experienced in the industrialized countries.Despite the complexities of development  the international community cannot evade its responsibilities by claiming that no solutions are available. He have sufficient experience to attack the problems of development. More realism  higher ambitions and an open dialog between the North and the South are called for.The Charter of the United Nations established respect for and promotion of human rights as one of the principles of the Organization. During its 40 years of existence  the United Nations  together with its Member States  has made great progress in the codification of human rights  whether defined in terms of political rights  economic  social and cultural rights  action against racism or the general development of the international bill of human rights. Finland welcomed the adoption by consensus by the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.The implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms remains inadequate. Violations of human rights are the rule rather than the exception. Yet all Member States have undertaken a solemn commitment to promote and respect human rights. Observance of human rights is not an option  but an obligation.He envisage a great task for all countries in promoting and implementing human rights both nationally and internationally. Progress in this task will help to strengthen the rule of law and to build a durable world order in peace and security.The world conference to review and appraise the achievements of the United Nations Decade for women  held at Nairobi two months ago  was a significant step towards full equality between women and men at all levels and in all spheres of life. The adoption without a vote of the final document on forward-looking strategies to improve the status of women to the year 2000 was a successful conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women. Global  regional and national mechanisms for advancing the status of women have been constituted. That process must be carried on.The General Assembly has designated this year as International Youth Year. The Year aims at focusing international attention on issues of interest to young people and on their aspirations  problems and concerns. During the Year  these issues have been highlighted all over the world. In order to improve their position  young people themselves should become more active  not only at the national level  but internationally as well. The active participation of youth awakens new hope and brings renewed energy to the affairs of societies and to the international community.The United Nations is an organization for the future  for our children and for our youth. Today  young people are confronted with a world plagued by many serious problems. However  there exists a universal and strong will among the peoples of the world to overcome these problems and to provide a better future for coming generations. This will should be fully reflected in our work at the United Nations.Forty years ago  the peoples of the United Nations committed themselves in the Charter to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors  and to unite their strength to maintain international peace and security. Today  on behalf of the people and the Government of Finland  I renew that pledge. By pursuing our policy of neutrality we wish to serve the international community for the benefit of peace  security and development."
"46",2412,"FRA",40,1985,"I should like first to congratulate the President on his election. I see it as a tribute not only to him personally but also to his country which holds a distinguished place in international co-operation. Everyone knows how much Spain means to France. In the very near future  our peoples will be together in the European Community. I am pleased that a common future now stands before them.I should also like  before beginning my address proper  to add my expressions of sympathy to those already voiced by numerous speakers before me regarding the tragic events that have just occurred in Mexico.The international community quickly demonstrated its solidarity  and my country joined in this widespread movement. I should also like to express here the respect that France has for the courage and dignity shown by the Government and people of Mexico in the face of their terrible ordeal. The catastrophe there reminds us that the happiness of men is uncertain and their destiny precarious. May they by their actions avoid compounding the suffering caused by nature.This session of the General Assembly marks the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. It is the age of maturity  a time for reflection and for taking stock.Speaking on behalf of France  a Founding Member of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council  I should like to refer to the three main ideals of this Organization which are the reason for its existence  namely  security  freedom and development.With respect to security  the power of the atom is the dominating factor.Peace through deterrence has so far prevented East-West conflicts from taking the form of direct confrontations between nuclear Powers. Maintenance of the balance of forces - nuclear as well as conventional - is of vital importance. This armed peace must be maintained for the future at a verifiable level of arms at the lowest possible level.	""	 The Soviet-American talks in Geneva on nuclear arms and space should lead the two countries directly concerned to proceed to deep cuts in their most destabilizing offensive weapons while maintaining strategic equilibrium.France welcomed the resumption of contacts between East and West and is particularly pleased that the General-Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev  is to visit Paris shortly.New technologies have led some people to think that we could be turning a page of the nuclear era in 10 or 20 years  at the end of some ill-defined transitional period. This idea  which is attractive at first sight  merely reopens an old debate which has nurtured an illusion in mankind - the illusion that security can be achieved through invulnerability. Have we realized the extent to which a would-be aggressor could turn this risky situation to his own account?At the Geneva Conference on Disarmament in June 1984  and then again this year  France made two proposals: first  that the two super-Powers limit the military uses of space at the same time as they reduce their offensive nuclear systems; and  secondly  that multilateral negotiations strengthen the international administration of the organization of space for peaceful uses.The use of devices in space to see  listen and communicate contributes to security; satellites already constitute guarantees for peace and could fill this function even better if the international satellite monitoring agency my country proposed more than seven years ago were established. But  on the other hand  let us acknowledge that the deployment of new types of anti-missile or anti-satellite weapons on earth or in space would lead to a new race  with its risk of destabilizing effects. We see that possession of anti-missile and anti-satellite operational devices by one of the two super-Powers is viewed as justification for the other's efforts. It is high time that the two super-Powers agreed not to continue in this direction  they should distinguish very well between research  testing and development.During the same time  the Conference on Disarmament should in our view set forth the rules limiting anti-satellite systems. It should also establish real confidence-building measures for space  strengthen the existing system of notification of launches of objects into space  and  lastly  extend to the satellites of other countries the bilateral commitments already made by the United States and the Soviet Union concerning the immunity of their observation satellites.Those proposals are intended to be constructive and realistic. They take into account both the destabilizing nature of certain military activities in space and the difficulty of verifying the dismantling of systems already in place.Let us therefore define the true nature of the challenge in space so as to avert the risk of a new arms race. But  in so doing  let us not forget the main objective: the reduction of the offensive nuclear weapons systems of the two most heavily armed countries.As far as my country is concerned  the President of the French Republic defined in this very body two years ago the conditions in which France would be ready to participate in this undertaking. Our willingness on this score has not changed; it has not diminished.It is in the context of such a process that France judges it necessary to raise again the question of nuclear testing designed to modernize its defensive force. I know that many delegations consider this a painful problem for which a solution is long overdue. We respect their concern  but in the case of issues like this we cannot settle for fine words or an imprecise assessment. So let us examine the facts.To date  France has carried out less than one-tenth of the total number of nuclear tests carried out by the Soviets and the Americans. As of 1974 it ceased tests in the atmosphere. It takes every precaution in carrying out its tests  and this was confirmed  in particular  by the team of international experts that went to the site last year. No other nuclear Power did this before and none has done it since. Only recently  in Mururoa  the President of the Republic renewed the invitation he had extended to the countries of the South Pacific to see for themselves  at the actual site  the harmless nature of French nuclear tests.Though not bound by any negotiated agreement  France has reduced the power of its tests below the threshold of 150 kilotons  a figure that the Soviet Union and the United States have presented to this Assembly for the past 10 years as a step deserving of the highest praise. At every opportunity  France demonstrates its goodwill  but it will never compromise its security interests; nor will it renounce the legitimate exercise of its sovereignty  whatever the cost to it. Continuation of the tests is in fact necessary to maintain the credibility of its forces. The limitation of tests could only be understood and be meaningful in the context of an eventual deescalation by the most heavily armed Powers.But the debate on international security is not limited to the problems of nuclear disarmament.The Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe is to cur mind very important. Thirty-five States are participating and are seeking to define concrete measures to establish confidence among all.In addition to threats of conventional conflicts  the specter of the use of chemical weapons has also resurfaced recently. I should like to repeat strongly ray country's condemnation of any violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925  wherever it takes place. France supports and will continue to support the efforts of the international community and  in the first place  those of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  to proceed without delay to an impartial establishment of the facts where allegations of the use of these weapons have been made. France has not hesitated to speak out in favor of the work of the Conference on Disarmament toward negotiating a convention banning the manufacture of chemical weapons and providing for the destruction of existing stockpiles under international supervision.More generally  the deterioration of the security conditions in the world is a check to development when it does not wipe it out altogether. That is why we repeat that disarmament and development must be linked. The President of the French Republic made this point in 1983 from this very rostrum. France is ready to serve as host to an international conference on this subject in Paris.The recent work of the preparatory committee of the United Nations conference on the relationship between disarmament and development has confirmed during the course of the summer the readiness of everyone. X am therefore pleased to state again here France's offer.I come now to the second part of my statement.France will speak out against all attacks on liberty  on the physical and moral integrity of the individual and the dignity of the human person  and will act indefatigably wherever these values are threatened.We recently celebrated at Helsinki the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.That anniversary reminds us of the great ambitions we had at that time: to formulate for the old continent rules other than those imposed by threat  force or ideology  building not only between States but also between their citizens  new and peaceful relations based on the sovereignty and equality of each State and on the right of peoples to self-determination  with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Let us look back at the record of the past 10 years. It is mixed. Certainly  Europe has escaped the wars that are devastating so many other parts of the world  and its borders have been respected  and that is the main thing. But economic co-operation  cultural exchanges and contacts between people have not developed as they should. Human rights are still all too often  sometimes seriously  violated or ignored. Much still remains to be done  therefore.Governments must win the confidence of their citizens. Let us earn that confidence by guaranteeing them the exercise of all their freedoms  without which there can be no genuine democracy.Let us reunite families. Let us allow people to move and ideas to circulate without hindrance. Let us guarantee free exchanges. Let us agree to live in the diversity of our cultures.How can I fail to mention under this heading one of the tragedies of our time - apartheid? The origin of the conflicts that are convulsing South African society is to be sought in that system  which is based on an odious doctrine and shameful practices.Responses to our many appeals have been announced by Pretoria; they are not enough. Only by the speedy and total elimination of apartheid will there be salvation for South Africa.The opening of genuine dialog between all the communities and recognition of the same civil and political rights for all South Africans constitute the only possible and acceptable basis for change. The current repression and violence can only lead to an impasse.Faced with the deteriorating situation  France felt the time had come to take concrete initiatives. As early as May 1985 the Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to take measures against Pretoria if significant progress was not made within a reasonable period of time. Because of the worsening situation resulting from the imposition of a state of emergency  France recalled its Ambassador and decided on the immediate suspension of any new investment in South Africa. It then won adoption in the Security Council of resolution 569 (1985)   which recommends that States take voluntary measures against South Africa in order to induce its Government to engage in dialog. Since yesterday all the members of the European Community are taking actions to that end.Since we took action other countries have joined us. That is what is most important. The freedom and dignity of a people are at stake.The intransigence of the South African Government over Namibia is not acceptable either. After the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola in April 1985 there was some ground for hope. But the establishment of a so-called interim government in Windhoek  the action of South African military forces in Angola last May and again a few days ago and the raid on the capital of Botswana have shattered those hopes and helped to block negotiations. Despite those setbacks and difficulties  the international community must continue tirelessly to repeat that only Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes an acceptable basis for a definitive settlement to the question of Namibia.Toe many conflicts are causing bloodshed in the world  bringing suffering and death in their wake. In the Middle East the United Nations is endeavoring to secure respect for the principles enshrined in its Charter.France supports all initiatives that will help lead to progress towards a solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict through dialog and negotiation. It approves the initiative of the King of Jordan last 11 February  in agreement with the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  and will continue to provide assistance and support  just as it will encourage the Head of the Government of Israel in that regard.My Government  as it has demonstrated on many occasions  is ready to support the efforts of those who sincerely desire to work for peace  which can be based only on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In order to be lasting  that peace must take into account two principles that are indivisible: the right of Israel to exist in security and the right of the Palestinians to self-determination  with all that that implies.As for Lebanon  which has been so sorely tried  it  too  has the right to peace and its inhabitants have the right to security  whatever the community to which they belong. France has continually asserted that the solution to the crisis in Lebanon must be based on the respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unity of that country. That in turn presupposes a genuine national reconciliation among all the Lebanese  My Government is working ceaselessly to that end  giving assistance and support to the lawful authorities of the country.I wish also to mention here the fate of individuals  French and others  held hostage in Lebanon. The French Government condemns categorically that odious blackmail  and solemnly appeals to all those who may be able to help secure their release.I turn to the conflict between Iran and Iraq. The international community has often expressed its extreme concern about that endless and bloody confrontation.It is essential that there finally be a cease-fire and that the relevant Security Council resolutions  which have lost none of their value and relevance  be accepted at last by the two belligerents and implemented in their entirety.In order to speed up the start of the necessary negotiations  France encourages and supports international initiatives - in the first place  naturally  the action taken by our Organization.In Afghanistan  foreign intervention has been sustaining the war for almost six years. Far from abating  the fighting is spreading and growing in intensity  exacerbating the trials of a courageous people. There as elsewhere  justice is consistent with good sense. An answer is to be found only in a political solution that will secure simultaneously the withdrawal of foreign forces  the free self-determination of the population and the stability of the region.We know that those are the principles that guide the good offices of our Secretary-General. France supports them  without overlooking the fact that their success depends first on the intentions of the occupying Power  which alone is in a position to remove one of the major causes of international tension. Did the head of the Soviet delegation  when he spoke the day before yesterday open the door to hope?With regard to the distressing and dangerous situation in Cambodia  France reiterates its condemnation of the occupation of that country by foreign forces. It deplores the exacerbation of suffering inflicted on civilian populations by the recent military operations on the Khmer-Thai border. It stresses the urgency of a peaceful solution based on the withdrawal of foreign troops and the national reconciliation of the Khmer people.The division of the Korean people - a tragedy that has been with us for 40 years - still continues. In the last few months a few encouraging signs have appeared. Recently  separated families were able to meet again for a few hours. I see in that reason for hope.At this point I should like to mention the hope that is emerging from the changes in an entire continent: I refer to South America. Happily  democracy continues to be consolidated there. France welcomes that  especially as a difficult economic situation and the burden of considerable foreign debt have imposed difficult economic policies on Governments.In Central America  clearly the conflicts cannot be resolved by military means. The countries of that region should be encouraged to find quickly among themselves the path to negotiation. The Contadora group therefore has our support and backing.I now come to France's third priority in external policy - development. The overriding need for solidarity between the industrialized and the developing countries derives from the conviction - which has been repeated many times by the French Head of State - that the future of the North and the South is linked and that there can be no lasting growth for the developed countries if the developing countries are excluded. For the past two years the international community has accomplished a great deal towards helping these countries - first of all  during crisis situations.Who could deny that Governments and public opinion responded rapidly and generously to the extreme hardships of the African countries? I should like to praise the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in particular the organization last March of a donors' conference in Geneva and the creation of the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa.This aid drive is without precedent. Almost 7 million metric tons of grain have been collected for Africa - a considerable figure commensurate with the tragedy that is taking place. The European Community and France made a substantial contribution to that effort  as the representative of the presidency has indicated from this rostrum. But the main problem is to avoid a recurrence of such a situation  thereby ensuring a resumption of the development process on a permanent basis.It is essential to maintain the flow of official development assistance. For its part  France will contribute more than 0.55 per cent of its gross national product in 1985  a figure close to its 1988 target of 0.7 per cent.The poorest countries deserve priority attention  for without an increased flow of financial resources it will be difficult  if not impossible  for them to face a particularly unfavorable international economic climate. The establishment of the Special Fund for Africa under the auspices of the World Bank - to which France has made a decisive contribution - constitutes an important step in that direction.It is also with the hope of eradicating famine that France has proposed to our industrial partners a ""plan for Africa""  which provides among other things for increased agricultural development and a co-ordinated program to combat desertification. We are pleased that that plan has been adopted and that work currently being carried out by experts will make it possible to implement it soon.Finally  I should like to confirm here the French President's intention to convene an international conference on forest protection in Paris next February. That conference could  in conjunction with other international organizations concerned - primarily the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) - propose concrete answers to the concerns of countries which see their forests disappearing and with them often all forms of life.Those efforts were a response to the most critical situations. For the rest  this past year has seen a relative improvement in the situation of the third world.But I should like to make two remarks on this subject. First of all  this progress is related to the economic improvement in the developed countries. The relative decline in real interest rates and the value of the dollar have accentuated this trend. But these phenomena  while positive  are primarily and essentially cyclical and short-term  and therefore remain precarious. Let us hope that the decisions taken here in New York last Sunday by the finance ministers of the five most industrialized countries will help to consolidate this trend.The second point is that we must guard against excessive optimism. Admittedly  the problem of international debt has been brought under control for the time being  thanks to the joint action of the Paris Club  banks and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and especially the extremely austere and courageous adjustment policies adopted by the debtor countries and their peoples. But let us be careful.The improvement in external accounts has come about at the cost of lowered income for populations - a situation that cannot continue for long.Debt-servicing  principal and interest  still absorb often considerable amounts  if not all  of annual export earnings.The fragile nature of this improvement is therefore blatantly obvious. An entire continent of which I have already spoken  Africa  remains on the sidelines of this progress and continues to become increasingly impoverished. The same danger will beset the other continents; and unless we manage steadily to channel capital from the developed to the developing countries  whose financing needs remain structural  the situation will be aggravated.Here  we cannot be satisfied with the trend of these past few years which have seen a slow-down in direct investment  a reduction in bank credits and repayments to multilateral financial institutions of amounts greater than withdrawals. All this has led to an inversion of North-South capital flows. The developing countries are now paying more to those in the North than they receive from them.It is essential to improve the existing mechanisms for debt management by providing developing countries with adjusted financing. This is the objective of France's repeated appeals to increase World Bank capital  issue additional special drawing rights  and more generally increase official development assistance.It is also to be feared that in the months to come the slow-down in the American economy - inadequately compensated for by the growth in Europe and Japan -may have serious consequences for the developing countries; or that rising protectionist pressures in the North will stifle developing countries by limiting their export possibilities and therefore their ability to repay debts.Certainly  as I said a moment ago  increased dialog among the main industrialized countries is leading to an improved international climate. That dialog should be stepped up in all existing forums and on all occasions. The time has come for a comprehensive and serious consideration of this subject.Let us take another example - monetary affairs. France  on several occasions in particular when the President of the Republic addressed this Assembly two years ago - has called for an international monetary conference that would seek to define new guidelines  thereby making monetary fluctuations more stable. Industrialized countries and groups of developing countries  in particular the non-aligned countries  advocate a comparable move. It is only through such discussions that we can make the progress the world needs so urgently.France for its part is ready for dialog and action. In the monetary  financial and commercial fields  its determination remains firm.At one time the North-South dialog inspired much hope  in particular within our Organization. However  global negotiations never took place  and meetings between experts in international forums have yielded very few concrete results. Today  approaches based on sectoral strategies  integrating emergency aid and giving priority to rural development and training  are being launched and developed. My country approves these approaches  which meet today's needs. But it remains essential that we formulate without delay reforms that will bring about deep and lasting changes in relations between States for the benefit of peoples  their individual liberties and their rights.In reviewing the principal tasks incumbent upon the United Nations I have been forced to recognize that the present state of the world is far from satisfactory. More than ever  we need the United Nations  the forum pat excellence for meetings and discussion. During the fortieth anniversary we shall have a special opportunity to underscore the need to make negotiation prevail in conflicts and solidarity triumph over selfishness.This unfortunately gloomy picture does  however  have its bright spots and more encouraging prospects. I wish to conclude on a positive note by mentioning an undertaking on which my country sets great store. I refer to the construction of Europe.Forty years ago Europe was a devastated battlefield. What has it become today? It is a community without precedent in history  a force for peace and equilibrium in the world  a community that has learned its lesson from its past and that practices  among its members and vis-&-vis the rest of the world  the peaceful settlement of disputes and solidarity with the very poor.Our colleague from Luxembourg has reviewed the main lines of our action. A few words will suffice to recapitulate: the coming expansion of membership to include Spain and Portugal; the renewal of the Lome Convention with 66 countries in Asia  the Caribbean and the Pacific; the establishment of direct relations with the countries members of the Contadora Group and also the work now in progress to improve institutions and technological capacities with the Eureka project and to move towards a Europe of citizens  a political Europe. Indeed  European construction will be one of the great ventures of the second half of this century.In conclusion  let me say that France wishes  together with others  to pursue its work for peace. It has heeded the message that has come to us from the depths of history. To those who are distressed by the future of the world  it hopes that we may respond together in the name of the principles that  40 years ago  were the. cornerstone of our action."
"47",2527,"GBR",40,1985,"Let me first join those who have congratulated Mr. de Pinies on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Our affairs could not be in better or more experienced hands. It is a source of pleasure and pride to my country that we should have as President at this fortieth session the representative of a country shortly to become a full member of the European Community.It is in the same spirit that I express our thanks to the outgoing President  Paul Lusaka  the distinguished representative of a Commonwealth country  for the impartial and skillful way in which he conducted the Assembly's affairs over the past 12 months.I should like also to renew my tribute to our Secretary-General. I salute his dedication and persistence in seeking solutions to the world's problems. His latest report  like its predecessors  is another eloquent and persuasive testimony to the importance of this Organization. We shall continue to lend his efforts our fullest support.In a few weeks we shall mark the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. In doing so we shall reaffirm the insight defined by the then British Prime Minister  Clement Attlee  at the first session of the General Assembly  in London  as follows:""the realization by all nations that without co-operation for peace there can be no security for any nation"". That thought is just as valid today as when he spoke to a world then riven asunder by the second global conflict in 30 years  a world in which war had brought the international trading system almost to a halt  a world in which many of the greatest cities lay in ruins  a world in which some of today's greatest nations had yet to be born.In the years since then the membership of this Organization has grown dramatically. Together we can take credit for much of the progress that has been achieved  we have moved away from the sharpness and the savagery of world conflict and undertaken a massive task of reconstruction. We have managed a period of unprecedented economic growth alongside an enormous population explosion. We have welcomed and fostered the emergence of over 100 new sovereign nations. We have fashioned and developed a range of effective institutions for international co-operation.Britain is proud  too  to belong to two very different groupings which each in its own way demonstrates the growing pattern of interdependence. This year in the Bahamas  Commonwealth Heads of Government representing 49 nations from all continents and outlooks will be meeting together. By the end of this year  too  the membership of the European Community will have expanded to 12 with theaccession of Spain and Portugal. It is now substantially the world's largest trading bloc  and its role on the world stage is becoming steadily store significant. In his statement yesterday the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg gave eloquent expression to the shared values and common approach of all the members of the European Community.Tomorrow the commemorative meeting of the Security Council will give us a chance to take stock of all that has been achieved over the past 40 years. We should at the same time acknowledge the scale and complexity of the tasks that still challenge us. We must not underestimate the efforts the international community still has to make if our actions are to achieve the goals sat by the founding fathers.We still live in a world wracked by continuing violence and conflicts  by economic and social hardships and by famine and disease. Last week's massive natural disaster which has brought such tragic suffering to the Mexican people is a grievous reminder of man's vulnerability to his environment. We all pay a tribute to the courage with which the Mexican Government and people have responded to this catastrophe.In the Secretary-General's own words ""We face today a world of almost infinite premise which is also a world ofpotentially terminal danger."" {A/40/1  p2)  As he so rightly argues  the solution lies in our own hands  in our will and determination to decide the kind of world we wish to see in the years ahead and to take the steps necessary to achieve it. So this special anniversary is an occasion on which we should not just reflect on our past but  much more important  look ahead to the questions that will face us in the future and start shaping our policies now.The need for such foresight applies with particular force to our economic agenda. The appalling famine in sub-Saharan Africa has shown how a series of problems - some natural  some man-made - can case together to bring unimaginable suffering: long-run degradation of the environment  progressive failure of agricultural production and prolonged drought. This disaster has evoked a dramatic response from many countries. The West has led the way  The United Kingdom alone last year contributed a quarter of a billion dollars. Almost half of that came from private donations  the gifts of individual men and women. Moreover  we have not stopped providing funds. We have made sure through the provision of aircraft of the Royal Air Force that our supplies reach those most in need as quickly as local conditions will permit.But spontaneous generosity even on this scale offers no long-term solution because we live in a world of paradoxes. Some areas of the world still face acute hunger and are unable to feed themselves. Other parts - astonishingly more and more - face mounting problems of over-production. The pattern of this development is itself remarkable. The vast populations of China and India  despite all the prophecies of doom  are now more them self-sufficient in food. Increasing reliance on the enterprise of individuals and on the incentives of the market place has in many cases provided the spur to growing efficiency. By contrast  other countries  some of them better endowed with natural resources  still face the need to import food. And in some regions natural resources are being threatened or destroyed by over-exploitation while nearby  sometimes even in the same country  they are underdeveloped and under-used.If we are to resolve these contradictions  ensure a more balanced development of the world economy and secure a rising standard of living for all our citizens  we must create a wider understanding of the reasons for success and failure.We must identify ways to exploit and yet preserve our resources more effectively. We must train our people more imaginatively  deploy our common technological knowledge more skilfully. We must shape our institutions and societies so that the natural forces of economic change and growth are encouraged and not stifled. As has been shown in Ethiopia  the United Nations can play a vital role in matching resources to needs.Sustainable economic growth is essential if we are to secure a reduction in the present crippling burden of debt in many countries. Last year the world economy grew by 4.3 per cent  the fastest rate for six years. Many countries have acted courageously in meeting the economic and social pressures of adjustment. We have heard in this debate why it is necessary for this difficult match of problems to be handled sensitively. That is why there is a duty on us all  as we respond through the international institutions on a case-by-case basis  to take account of the very real problems faced by debtor countries. We must try to create the stable framework that will enable them to pursue their policies of adjustment. That is the importance of the continuing need to reduce deficits in some of the industrialized countries.Almost three years ago I had the privilege of presiding as Chairman of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a substantial increase in IMF quotas. Last year  at the Economic Summit in London  we were able to encourage the introduction of multi year rescheduling agreements where appropriate. We need new to address ourselves to the level of resources available to the World Bank. Britain would like to see early agreement in principle to a general capital increase for the World Bank and stands ready to play its part.An urgent and continuing need is for us to support and strengthen the open trading system. This is essential if we are to resist protectionism and ensure thatour trade contributes to the prosperity of all countries  particularly those in the developing world. We welcome the forthcoming meeting of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to discuss a new round of negotiations. Without such a new round the forces of protectionism will gain in strength. Time is running out.We need not simply preserve the open trading system but also see that it works more openly and more widely. Open trading needs to be broadened to include the service industries and the expanding economies of those countries that are' increasing their industrial base. Greater stability in world currency markets is essential. In particular  we need stability at rates that will promote the expansion of world trade rather than increase protectionist pressures. That is the importance of the agreement reached in this city only three days ago at the meeting of Finance Ministers and central bankers of the major industrialized countries.But the need to look ahead is not confined to economic issues. We need the same approach in tackling the complex political and security issues that face us. The Secretary-General has reminded us of the extent to which the fundamental architecture of this Organization has been flawed by what he refers to as ""the lack of that unanimity of the permanent members which was to have been its main driving force"". Nowhere is this more evident than in the division between East and West. Perhaps the most important question facing this Organization during its fifth decade is whether we shall be able to record positive steps that will narrow this crucial gap.I believe we can. The last two years have seen a considerable increase in contacts between East and West. I welcome that. Since becoming Foreign Secretary I have made a point bf visiting every one of the countries in Eastern Europe and getting to know their leaders. In the same spirit we welcomed Mr. Gorbachev's important visit to Britain at the end of last year. The first meeting betweenPresident Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev will take place this November. That will be an important opportunity for searching and substantive discussions which can lay thefoundation for greater mutual confidence between East and West. It should demonstrate that the leaders of the world's largest Powers are serious in their desire to overcome the difficulties between them.But contact alone is not enough. The true foundations of understanding cannot be laid in an atmosphere of mistrust. Mr. Gorbachev has said ""there is no fatal inevitability of conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States"". In that he echoes President Reagan's belief that ""the Soviet leaders have much to gain from joining the West in mutual arms reductions and expanding co-operation"". The Soviet Union and its leaders need have no doubt about the sincerity of the Western commitment. The people of Britain would like nothing better than a reduction in tension and an increase in co-operation. The task for statesmanship roust be to transform common aspirations into the substance of agreement.The world needs this most urgently in the field of arms control. We warmly welcomed the resumption of the Geneva negotiation on nuclear and space arms between the United States and the Soviet Union. We support their aim of preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth.Our overriding objective must be to obtain security at the lowest level of armaments. We do not believe that either side should strive for superiority. The aim must be mutual balance  taking account of current developments. The outcome of the process should enhance and not undermine deterrence. The negotiations must be on the basis of compliance with existing obligations. These talks present a forum for hope  a chance for constructive negotiations  and a potential for real and verifiable progress. It is only at Geneva that public declarations can be transformed into agreements that are seriously intended. Megaphone diplomacy leads only to a dialog of the deaf. But a genuine wish to serve the cause of peace will meet a swift response from our side.Recently Mr. Gorbachev told the world that his country trusts the United States no more than the latter trusts the Soviet Union. Mrs. Thatcher made much the same point when she said that neither side looks at each other through rose-tinted spectacles. Verification provides one of the essential elements in any arms control agreement. In itself  it breeds the confidence essential to the preservation of a regime of arms control. Equally  verification requires a measure of confidence on both sides in the good faith of the other.If that objective is to be achieved it is vital that countries comply with the treaties and commitments which they have undertaken. Particularly important are those treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union which govern strategic relationships: the strategic arms limitation agreements and the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile System. These agreements form the foundation for the present structure of mutual security.Concern for international stability was of course a prime motivating force behind the Non-Proliferation Treaty. For that reason  we were particularly pleased with the successful outcome of the recent Review Conference and the substantive final document agreed by consensus. We share fully the Conference's conviction that the Treaty is essential to international peace and security. We support unreservedly their determination to enhance its implementation and further strengthen its authority.There is no doubt that this result reflects the renewed commitment of the international community to use the Non-Proliferation Treaty to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. We call upon those who remain outside the Treaty especially those with significant unsafe-guarded nuclear facilities - to accede to the Treaty is soon as possible and so help to protect the world against the potential horrors of nuclear war.But equally we must not overlook the importance of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in promoting the safe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  particularly in the developing world. We have announced our intention to double  between now and 1990  the funds we contribute to developing countries party to the Treaty through the technical assistance projects administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). By these actions we shall continue to demonstrate our commitment to check uncontrolled nuclear proliferation.It is right that we should concentrate our attention on the global issues that threaten all nations' security. But in this world of close interdependence  more specific regional issues also affect our interests. I think in particular of southern Africa  where the growing crisis in South Africa and the continuing threats to her neighbors cause us grave concern.We strongly condemn the incursion into Angolan sovereign territory by South African defense forces. We have joined with the rest of the Security Council in giving force to this condemnation. Such acts can only undermine the stability of the region and damage efforts to achieve Namibian independence. South Africa should be in no doubt of our determination that Namibia must be brought quickly to independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)j this resolution remains the only internationally accepted basis for a Namibian settlement.Southern Africa has seen major changes in recent years with the coming to independence of Mozambique  Angola and Zimbabwe. It is essential that all the countries of the region should be freed from the present tensions and allowed to concentrate on building a peaceful and prosperous future in harmony with their neighbors.In South Africa itself we deeply deplore the failure of the South African authorities to lift the state of emergency  the continuing repression of peaceful protest  and the detention of citizens without trial. More fundamentally  we reject the system of apartheid - which is so contrary to the values of the United Nations Charter and which undermines much of real value in South Africa. He call upon the South African Government urgently to move beyond mere words to actions which are long overdue: to end apartheid  and to establish a system of government acceptable to the people of South Africa as a whole.Britain is united with other countries in its determination to see fundamental changes made. We have consistently brought pressure to bear on the South African Government to achieve this. We comply fully with the United Nations arms embargoes  we do not collaborate with the South Africans in the development of their nuclear program  civil or military. Our guidelines for the disposal of North Sea oil exclude sales to South Africa. We operate controls on a wide range of sensitive exports to South Africa. We fulfill our obligations to discourage sporting contacts. We have fully applied the European code of conduct to British companies operating in South Africa to ensure that they contribute as effectively as possible to the crucial changes we wish to promote.Where we differ from some is not in our willingness to apply pressure but in our judgment of the likely effectiveness of mandatory economic and trade boycotts. I understand the passions that prompt calls for such measures. But we are not persuaded that measures of this kind would achieve the aims of those who call for them. They would diminish rather than increase effective pressures on the South African Government to introduce fundamental changes  and would bear most heavily on the weaker sections of the population and neighboring countries. We believe that all those with longstanding political  economic and diplomatic contacts with South Africa have a responsibility to use such links to promote fundamental change.In keeping with this approach  we have reached agreement with our European partners on a number of measures which we believe will strengthen the forces for change in South Africa. I have today announced our adoption of all the measures agreed at Luxembourg on 10 September. These measures build on the recent visit of my three Community colleagues which clearly demonstrated European concern. In recent weeks there have been signs of movement by the South African Government. These must now be translated into firm decisions to dismantle apartheid. To this end there is now an urgent need for dialog with genuine representatives of the African majority.In the Middle East tension has too often flared into violent conflict. It is a sad reflection that in no single year since the United Nations was founded has this area been at peace. Nowhere are negotiated settlements more urgently needed.In Lebanon there can be no peace until the communities there themselves work together to rebuild their country free from outside interference. Israel must withdraw all its forces from Lebanese territory as soon as possible. And the Lebanese themselves must put an end to the appalling cycle of violence in that country. We condemn without reservation the kidnapping of innocent hostages  including the British United Nations official  Mr. Alec Collett. His kidnappers should release him without delay. In the Gulf  we are all appalled by the tragic and wasteful conflict between Iran and Iraq which has now lasted almost as long as the Second world War. We deplore the use of chemical weapons. And we entreat both sides to refrain from attacks on civilian targets - particularly those on merchant shipping in international waters. An early initiative to end the war is desperately needed. The Secretary-General's eight-point proposals offer the best way forward. We will continue to give him our full support.A solution of the Arab/Israel dispute has been a major goal of this Organization almost from its foundation. That in itself testifies to the exceptional difficulties in securing a balanced settlement. But I believe that this year there are signs of readiness to seek peaceful solutions to the dispute. I think in particular of the constructive moves by King Hussein of Jordan  for v. \ch Mrs. Thatcher has recently reaffirmed our active support. The world community must give firm backing to all those who eschew violence in favor of patient diplomacy. That is the way towards a just and lasting peace based on the principles long espoused by the United Nations.Only the parties directly concerned can negotiate such a peace. But if they are to have the confidence to enter what are bound to be difficult and delicate negotiations; they will need strong encouragement and support from the entire international community so fully represented here in the United Nations. This Organization is based on confidence in the power of diplomacy  negotiation and dialog. Hy Government shares that faith. The vital necessity is for the process of dialog to get urgently under way in this area where for so long minds have failed to meet.I am conscious that it is only too easy for speakers addressing this Assembly to call on other countries to put their house in order. I should therefore like to turn to two issues where Britain is making a direct and positive contribution.The tragic divide in Cyprus continues. The Secretary-General has shown skill and determination in seeking to bring the two parties together after the failure of talks in January. We wish his current initiative every success  and hope that President Kyprianou and Mr. Denktash will agree to meet as soon as possible. The British Government continues to do everything it can to assist the Secretary-General. An agreement has been tantalizingly close before. All the parties have a responsibility to see that it does not evade us again.Over the past year we have kept up our active search for ways to restore more normal relations with Argentina. Since the conflict  we have removed financial restrictions  and offered talks on a series of practical issues. On several occasions we have pressed for the reciprocal lifting of restrictions on trade. In the absence of an Argentine response we took yet another unilateral step last July - to improve trading relations by lifting our ban on Argentine imports. Argentina has failed to reciprocate.We shall continue to look for ways of improving relations with Argentina. At the same time we shall maintain our firm commitments to the people of the Falkland Islands.By insisting that Britain must first commit itself to negotiations on sovereignty before there can be discussion of any aspect of our bilateral relations  Argentina has blocked progress. Ours is the sure realistic approach to the re-establishment of confidence between the peoples of the United Kingdom and Argentina and the reduction of tension in the South Atlantic.There are many areas where mutually beneficial co-operation is possible  for example  in the increasingly urgent task of conserving the South Atlantic fisheries. Informal discussions in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have shown that an international effort will be required to deal with this. We are ready to give our support to the FAO's constructive initiative and hope that the Argentines will be equally prepared to work with the FAO.This international approach to the conservation of fish stocks has been seen to be effective in other contexts. We were encouraged  for example  by the progress made at the recent meeting in Hobart of the Commission set up under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.Fisheries are only one aspect of the complex task of managing the resources of the continent of Antarctica. This has been successfully achieved under the Antarctic Treaty for a quarter of a century. The Treaty has preserved the continent as a zone of peace  free from nuclear explosions and dumping  militarization  or active territorial disputes. We firmly believe that an attempt to apply a common heritage regime would upset this proven system  risk destabilizing the region and jeopardize the present close international scientific collaboration in Antarctica. We shall maintain our support for the Antarctic Treaty system.In Central America there is widespread agreement on a number of objectives: the need for greater stability  for economic progress and for the reinforcement of democracy. These objectives are clearly set forth in the Con tad or a documents. The Contadora process has our firm support. The path to peace must lie through the strengthening of democracy and the limitation of arms; above all through the ending of cross-border subversion and interference. The present tense situation calls for the greatest possible restraint on all sides. The planned meeting in Luxembourg later this autumn between the Foreign Ministers of the Ten  plus Spain and Portugal  the Central American States and the Contadora countries will be a further demonstration of our support for peace efforts.In recent months  there have been a number of direct contacts between North and South Korea  contacts which are continuing and broadening. It is my profound hope that these may lead to a peaceful and lasting solution to the Korean problem  and that the people of Korea may shortly be represented at this forum.Viet Nam's illegal occupation of Cambodia is a continuing affront to international law. It jeopardizes regional stability. It flies in the face of international opinion. We give our firm support to the efforts of the members of he Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to persuade the Vietnamese Government to reach a political solution based unequivocally on the principles approved by the United Nations.The sixth year of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan has witnessed intensified Soviet efforts to subdue the Afghan people and to put pressure on Pakistan  where some 3 million Afghan exiles have found refuge. We hear much from the Soviet Government about its support for the oppressed peoples of the world. Yet in Afghanistan they are the oppressors. Why do they not honor their principles and signal their support for the admirable effort of the Secretary-General to achieve a solution  by agreeing to withdraw their troops? Only this concrete action will satisfy the demands of the world community and bring peace to Afghanistan.It is clear that in founding the United Nations our predecessors were as much concerned to promote the interests of individuals as to further those of their Governments. It is therefore particularly deplorable that 40 years later the rights  liberties and well-being of so many individuals should be at risk: not just from poverty  hunger and disease  but also from the policies and actions of Governments.We must all do everything we can to give force to our fine words about human rights. I said in Helsinki last July that while the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) had lit a beacon  the future strength of its light would depend entirely on the performance of the signatory States.That holds good in the United Nations context as well. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations organizations have a major role to play in making the existing human rights instruments more effective. But to achieve their targets they must have the full co-operation of the Member States.The United Nations finds itself today deeply involved in threats to our societies undreamed of by the founding fathers. The modern problem of drug abuse continues to take on new and more horrifying forms. This is a vice that particularly threatens our young people - and hence our future societies. Britain is increasing the resources devoted to the war against drugs and introducing new measures designed to strip those involved in drug trafficking of their ill-gotten rewards. Every Member State needs to take firm national action. But national efforts are only a part of the solution. Effective international co-operation to eradicate production  trafficking and the illegal harboring of offenders is urgently required. The Venezuelan initiative for a possible United Nations convention is a useful start. But we must all make a sustained and united attack on this vicious problem.Equally effective co-operation is required if we are to halt the spread of terrorism. Every attack on an innocent individual  every hijacking and every bomb is an attack on us all. Britain has taken steps to tighten control of unacceptable activities by members of diplomatic missions. In order to reduce the scope for aircraft hijackings Britain has also put forward specific proposals for extra international action to take sore stringent security measures at airports and in civil aviation operations. As the Secretary-General has pointed out  many of the necessary international agreements are in place. They need to be enforced. We must all sake it clear that we will not submit to blackmail  that we will not tolerate terrorist acts and that we will not harbor terrorists.The agenda of international problems is long and complicated. But if we are to take the right measures  we need to have the right mechanisms. On the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we should undoubtedly look again at the way in which this Organization works: to learn from its failures and to build on its successes.There are many ways in which this Organization can be improved. We must get better value for money throughout the united Nations systems. We must look for more effective co-ordination. We must prevent politicization of the technical bodies. We must try to streamline and make more relevant the work of the political organs. Many sensible and practical suggestions have been made. I think in particular of the recent proposals put forward by past Presidents of the Assembly on how this body can be more effective. But we must act on them.I have today concentrated on the challenges that still remain after the efforts of 40 years and on the dangers of complacency and inaction. But I am heartened by the evidence I see of a more practical and pragmatic approach to co-operation between our peoples. The General Assembly played a part with its economic declaration of last year. This year's human suffering in Ethiopia has prompted encouraging examples of international co-operation: British and Soviet aircraft worked side by side; united Nations and voluntary agencies pooled their efforts.Most striking of all was the moving response of our young people. The Live Aid concerts touched the hearts of millions of young men and women around the world.Their reaction showed that idealism and energy can rise above the barriers that divide us. It showed  too  the vigor of free societies  where individual initiative can still set a standard for Governments to match and can remind us of the real brotherhood of man.We who hold the responsibility of political leadership have to show that we are capable of rising to that challenge."
"48",2598,"GHA",40,1985,"It is a great pleasure  Sir  for my delegation to see you preside over the deliberations of the General Assembly at this historic session marking the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. The Assembly could not have been more fortunate than to be under your leadership at this time. Your personal association with the United Nations in the service of your esteemed Government spans over three decades and your wisdom and diplomatic skills are qualities that are well known to and revered by all. We extend our sincere congratulations to you personally and to your country and its people.To your immediate predecessor. Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  we also wish to express our thanks and appreciation for the excellent and skillful manner in which he managed the affairs of the last session. He deserves particular commendation for the arduous and extensive consultations that he conducted  within the framework of the Preparatory Committee in successfully planning the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.We should like to take this opportunity to express our sincere sympathy and condolences to the Government and people of Mexico on the devastation caused by the recent earthquakes in that country. We hope that the international community  through the United Nations system and otherwise  will offer adequate assistance to Mexico to enable it to recover quickly from the disaster.Forty years ago  out of the ruins and ashes of the Second World War was rekindled a new hope for mankind in the birth at San Francisco of the United Nations. The founding fathers  chastened by the experience of the most traumatic and devastating war in the history of mankind  were determined to prevent its recurrence. They vowed to seek a more peaceful and harmonious world through international co-operation. The Charter that they fashioned was the product of experience  wisdom and the international co-operative effort*In many respects  this unique Organization has proved in the last four decades more responsive and adaptable to the challenges that have confronted the world than could have been envisaged 40 years ago. With all the limitations placed on it by Member States  it is to our common credit that there has not been another world-wide conflagration in the 40 years the Organization has been in existence. Some would of course contend that the relative peace the world has enjoyed over the period has been due more to the so-called nuclear balance of terror than to the ministrations of the United Nations. But  no matter what the reasons  there is evidence of our ability as an Organization to maintain relative peace between the super-Powers and among countries of different ideological persuasions.True  the threat of nuclear war and the certainty that once unleashed it will lead to the annihilation of mankind  has also had its sobering effects on the nuclear Powers. We will not deny the role played by the nuclear balance of terror in contributing to the relative peace enjoyed by the world over the past 40 years. But let no one deny that  but for the involvement of the United Nations  some of the disputes and conflicts that have at times put various Member States at odds with one another might have engulfed the whole world in a conflagration that would have had unpredictable consequences. The United Nations must be duly recognized and commended  therefore  for the generally effective and successful role it has played in keeping the peace and maintaining international security.To those who are quick to deride the world Organization  let me recall but a few contributions that it has made in altering the course of history for the better. In the political and humanitarian fields especially  the United Nations must count among its landmarks or achievements: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted in 1948  which has inspired two major binding Covenants  one on civil and political rights and the other on economic  social and cultural rights  both of which were adopted in 1966; the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted in 1960; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  adopted in 1965; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  adopted in 1979; the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief  adopted in 1981; and the Convention against torture  adopted in 1984.In addition  the United Nations must be credited with the overwhelming social and economic improvement and benefits it has brought to the lives of millions of people all over the world through the activities and programs of such bodies as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAD) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  and the various other organs created in response to human needs and development.None of us can  of course  claim to be completely satisfied with the United Nations record in all fields  but we must remember that the Organization only mirrors the difficulties that we encounter in global co-operation. We cannot create obstacles within the Organization and then stand outside it to point an accusatorial finger at it. We are either internationalists or we are not.In many such instances the United Nations has been frustrated in its peace efforts either by parties directly or indirectly concerned in a particular dispute or by some Member States which simply refuse  for instance- to bear their share of the financial burden arising from the Organization's peace-keeping operations. Yet the Organization continues to soldier on in its efforts to keep the peace in flash points of conflict and generally to assure regional and international security. Our efforts in the Congo and Cyprus  to name but two  are proof of the moderate successes to the credit of the united Nations.It is clearly evident that it is the internecine character of the disputes between countries more than any failing of the United Nations that has prevented durable solutions over the years. Such seemingly intractable disputes that continue to plague and haunt our Organization are legion  but I shall limit my remarks to a few only.The Palestinian people continue to be deprived  because of Israeli intransigence  of their legitimate right to their homeland and to establish a sovereign and independent State of their own. Israel persists to this day in refusing to surrender Palestinian and Arab territories it has illegally occupied and annexed through acts of aggression and terrorist intimidation  in spite of resolutions of the General Assembly. For nearly as long as the United Nations has been in existence the Palestinian people have been denied their right to self-determination  independence and national sovereignty - goals that are in principle very dear to all of us.Even now that  at great cost to itself  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has softened its position and accepted United Nations resolutions which implicitly commit it to recognition of Israel's right to exist  there is still a baffling unwillingness to deal with its representatives as acceptableinterlocutors. It is obvious that those who are obstinately refusing to take part in dialog with the PLO are interested in achieving not a peaceful settlement but rather the abject humiliation of the Palestinian people. What is greater testimony to this than Tuesday's brutal Israeli raid against the PLO headquarters in Tunisia. In one stroke  Israelis have caused the death of many  including innocent Tunisians  and have jeopardized the momentum towards a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question. Let me once again repeat the view of my Government that there can be no surer prescription for continued tension and instability in the Middle East than the injustices and sufferings to which the Palestinian people are still subjected.The situation in Lebanon  as we know  has worsened considerably because of Israel's determination to maintain the so-called security zone in southern Lebanon after giving the world the impression that it was withdrawing its occupation troops from Lebanon. Israel's continued support for its surrogate force  the South Lebanon Army  which is active in south Lebanon  can only weaken the efforts of the Lebanese Government and the United Nations to restore the territorial integrity of the country.This is contrary to the purpose of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The mandate of UNIFIL  to which Ghana is proud to be a modest troop contributor  is to assist the Lebanese Government to establish its authority and secure its control over the entire territorial boundaries of Lebanon. Israel's establishment of a security zone inside Lebanese territory in the south is therefore in breach of Security Council resolutions and of international law. It is also distressing to see Iran and Iraq still locked in a costly  destructive and utterly futile war. The only beneficiaries of this harrowing conflict are those who sell arms to both sides. The cost in human lives and physical destruction to both sides is heartrending. We condemn the novel use of chemical weapons in the conflict as well as the resort to wanton military attacks on civilian populations. We appeal once again to Iran and Iraq to co-operate with the Secretary-General and to help turn the present lull or relative stalemate in the conflict into a cease-fire that would lead to an early and permanent cessation of hostilities and the eventual peaceful settlement of the conflict.In his report to the Security Council in June on the Cyprus question  the Secretary-General expressed his belief that agreement was within reach. He had come to that conclusion after almost a year of intensive consultations culminating in a high-level joint meeting between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot sides. It is  therefore  disappointing to note that the expected agreement has still not materialized.On the one hand; the Greek Cypriote have accepted the draft agreement drawn up by the Secretary-General as a basis for negotiations. On the other hand  the Turkish Cypriots  while committing themselves to the pursuit of a federal solution  have turned away from further substantive discussions and proceeded with a referendum and elections of their own. The Turkish Cypriots' actions in this regard are obviously in breach of United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984) and cannot be condoned if their ultimate objective is to transform the northern part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish community into a separate entity.The unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus must remain the fundamental basis for an honorable and peaceful solution to the Cyprus question. The process of balkanization will only deepen division and animosity between Greek and Turkish communities  which  willy-nilly  have to live together. We urge both sides to work for a lasting solution on the basis of the establishment of a federal State  as proposed by the Secretary-General  without further delay.There has been no let-up in the barrage of intimidation  vilification and open threats of invasion against the people of Nicaragua  in spite of their commitment to a peaceful solution to the dispute with their neighbors in Central America. The free elections conducted by the Government of Nicaragua have been spurned and denounced for no apparent reason by the very people who insist that there should be a return to democratic process in that country. It seems to us very strange logic indeed that the victims of the so-called contras  those whose ports have been mined and their economic installations sabotaged  should now be called terrorists.On this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations we owe it to international peace and friendly relations to point out to the United States without fear or favor that its conduct towards Nicaragua is in violation of the Charter and needlessly sacrifices human lives in favor of parochial interests. Our ethical and legal values prevent us from condoning the injustices being perpetuated daily against the Nicaraguan people with such blatant cynicism. The elements and basis for a peaceful solution are still available in the Contadora process  which enjoys the blessing of the Security Council and the international community as a whole. We urge the international community to persuade the United States that might is not always right  certainly not in the case of Nicaragua.In spite of the strenuous diplomatic efforts deployed within the framework of the united Nations and outside it  the conflict in Kampuchea still eludes solution. The continued military conflict has only accentuated the regional and international geopolitical dimension of the conflict.The withdrawal of all foreign troops as well as of support for guerrilla activity  is also central to a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. The principleof non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan must be respected by all concerned in the dispute. We urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts towards this end through the proximity talks conducted by his special representative.It is a happy coincidence that this year  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  also marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted by the General Assembly as resolution 1514 (XV) on 14 December 1960. The historic significance of this Declaration is evident in the greatly enlarged membership of the United Nations today. The vast majority of Member States present here today owe their freedom and independence to the firm and decisive assault launched by the United Nations to eradicate the evil of colonialism from the face of the earth. He recall that many Member States at the time were not in favor of the Declaration but  once adopted  it quickly gained international support and proved to be a turning point in modern history for us all. Regrettably  however  we must record on this otherwise happy anniversary that the process of decolonization is still not complete in several cases  such as New Caledonia and  principally  in southern Africa.Namibia and its long-suffering people are still held under the oppressive and illegal colonial yoke of racist South Africa. It is clear that underlying South Africa's actions on Namibia has always been an all-pervasive pattern of duplicity and bad faith. However  now even South Africa itself seems to have run out of tricks and has had to come into the open with its real intention of continuing to hold Namibia firmly in its colonial grip by installing the so-called interim government. That act confirms South Africa's determination to set up a puppet regime in Namibia.That racist regime has clearly no interest in the United Nations independence plan for Namibia and has drummed up every irrelevant excuse for delaying its implementation. The real purpose of South Africa is to circumvent Security Council resolution 435 (1978) altogether; but the United Nations should not permit the charade to continue any longer and should ensure that South Africa tackles the only real outstanding issue in the United Nations plan for Namibia  which is South Africa's choice of the electoral system to be used in ushering the Territory to independence.South Africa is obviously trying to buy time in its latest actions. Even the proponents of ""constructive engagement"" have been dismayed by it and have joined the international community in roundly condemning the illegal move and in declaring it null and void. The United Nations should exert pressure on the South African Government to proceed to the independence of Namibia without any further delay.By dint of repetitive propaganda  the so-called policy of linkage has been elevated to the status of a full-fledged precondition for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Thus the independence of Namibia has been hijacked and taken hostage apparently to secure the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola - an issue which is totally irrelevant to the United Nations independence plan for Namibia.It cannot be repeated too often and too strongly that Angola  in the exercise of its national sovereignty  has every right to station on its soil whatever troops it chooses to assist in the defense of its territorial integrity. Was South Africa not responsible in the first place  through its aggression  for the introduction of Cuban troops into Angola? Is South Africa not still persisting in its support of bandits and counterrevolutionaries operating in Angola? Is it not South Africa which carried out an abortive commando attempt in May to blow up oil installations in tile Cabinda province of Angola? The racist regime only wants the Cuban troops out of the way so that it can have the unfettered freedom to undermine the independence and sovereignty of Angola and of other front-line States on the false pretext that they harbor African National Congress freedom fighters.It is significant that South Africa and its supporters have conveniently ignored Angola's offer of a phased withdrawal of Cuban troops included in the Lusaka Accords. Angola has been perfectly reasonable and gone out of its way to seek a compromise on the issue. We therefore cannot allow the freedom and independence of the people of Namibia to be sacrificed on the altar of the so-called linkage and constructive engagement.Security Council resolution 566 (1985)  unanimously adopted at the end of the Council's debate in June  did not go far enough. The request of the non-aligned countries for the imposition of mandatory sanctions was opposed by the usual quarters and the resolutions did no more than merely urge selective voluntary measures against South Africa.The world was promised that it would see more severe action  including possibly the taking of measures under Chapter VIZ of the Charter  if South Africa did not mend its ways and failed to co-operate fully in the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia by September 1985. Since no such compliance has been forthcoming from South Africa the world is entitled to see the measures promised against it made good.We urge that effective action  in particular comprehensive  mandatory sanctions  should be invoked by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter since South Africa persists in obstructing the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). No other choice is left to the Security Council if it is not to lose all of its credibility and authority in this matter.Racist South Africa's repeated military attacks and terrorist aggression against neighboring States are matched only by the violence and brutality it routinely metes out to its black majority population  living under the inhuman conditions of the so-called bantustans. The events that have unfolded in that country in the last year have been enough to stir even the most conservative and heartless Governments and peoples into action against the racist regime. Even then  the situation has deteriorated  leading to a considerable loss of life.The state of emergency imposed on 36 districts in July has been futile  and desperate attempts by the racist South African regime to shore up apartheid in the face of the mounting tide of resistance by the black population is failing. The writing is clearly on the wall. The oppressed people of South Africa have run out of patience and are no longer willing to suffer the indignities and injustices of their condition in silence. They are no longer willing to put up with police harassment and the denial to them of basic rights; nor are they willing any longer to forgo their right to participate in the political process of their country on the basis of ""one man  one vote"".The struggle for freedom and for the destruction of apartheid in South Africa has reached a critical stage  and it behooves the international community to intensify its support for the freedom fighters in order to hasten the final demise of apartheid. This is why the people of South Africa felt painfully let down when  in response to Botha's state of emergency  the Security Council for the second time this year could not muster enough political will to impose mandatory economic sanctions on the racist South African regime.On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations it is entirely appropriate and imperative that the General Assembly should rededicate itself to launching a final assault on the citadel of apartheid in South Africa and on the last major stronghold of colonialism in Namibia. We must act to hasten the tide of history  even though its march in the direction of larger freedom  dignity and justice for the people of South Africa as a whole  without distinction of race or color  is indeed inevitable.In addition to its political problems  the continent of Africa continues to be caught in the throes of an economic crisis  with very little prospect of relief. The nature of this catastrophe and the consequential actions so far taken to deal with it are too well known to bear repetition.Africa's crisis requires that the international community address itself urgently to the short-  medium- and long-term development needs of the region while continuing its commendable efforts to meet the remaining emergency requirements of the countries most seriously affected by severe food shortages. African leaders  at the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in mid-July in Addis Ababa  again committed themselves to intensified efforts to overcome the economic crisis and rehabilitate their shattered economies. It is therefore time for developed countries to translate their statements of support and concern into actual commitments of resources and the implementation of the Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa  adopted by the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session in resolution 39/29  and the resolution on the same subject adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its second regular session  held in July 1985 in Geneva.In this context  developed countries  in view of their economic development and predominance in international trade  bear a special responsibility to complement the adjustment efforts already made by African and other developing countries through measures to facilitate a restoration of financial flows  the alleviation of the debt burden and the improvement of commodity prices.In a situation fraught with so many dangers  we believe that this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provides a good opportunity for all States to engage in a serious discussion of the urgent steps needed to restore the world economy to sustained growth. Interdependence has little meaning if we cannot act together to solve economic problems confronting both developed and developing countries.Permit me now to say a few words about Ghana's recent experience. We have made strenuous efforts to put our own economic house in order by implementing policy adjustments to restore incentives to producers  to rehabilitate the infrastructure  and to improve the overall management of the national economy.While some international support has been forthcoming  which we acknowledge with appreciation  this falls far short of the levels required and has still not been commensurate with the sacrifices of the Ghanaian people. Unless the international community seriously complements our efforts  the statements of support we have heard will have a painful and bitter ring  not only in our ears  but also in the ears of all those who are also striving to improve their economic lot.May I conclude my comments in this regard by restating our view that piecemeal and ad hoc solutions will not resolve the deep-seated  complex economic problems confronting the world today. At best  they will postpone the time when circumstances will force the developed countries to face up to the need for structural reform - for a fundamental restructuring of international economic relations to enable developing countries to achieve sustained growth and development. Today  a significant proportion of the international trade of developed countries is with developing countries; many millions of jobs in the industrialized countries depend on exports to the developing countries. Whether acknowledged or not  our fates are linked  and therefore over-abundance and deprivation cannot indefinitely continue to live peacefully side by side. Let us hope that this fortieth anniversary will bring leaders of the developed countries to a deeper understanding of these important issues.On this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the eyes of the whole world are riveted on this Assembly for unequivocal solutions to the serious problems of international security  colonialism in southern Africa and feeding the world's increasing number of the hungry. Such solutions are indeed within our grasp if only we can summon the necessary political will to achieve them. Let us work together for a better future  for failure would be too costly to contemplate."
"49",2644,"GIN",40,1985,"The President of the Republic of Guinea  Brigadier General Lansana Conte  President of the Military Committee for National Recovery  while conveying his regrets that he is unable to attend this session because of last-minute changes in his work program  did me the honor to appoint me to represent him here. I am pleased to be given the opportunity to participate in this session of the General Assembly  which commemorates the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of our world Organization.First of all  like all those who have preceded us  my delegation wishes  on behalf of President Lansana Conte  his Government and the people of Guinea to assure the Government and people of Mexico of their sympathy and solidarity at this time of deep affliction following the devastating and deadly earthquakes of 19 and 20 September. I ask all Mexicans to accept our most sincere condolences.I should like to congratulate you most warmly  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Guinea on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this Assembly. Your outstanding qualities as a statesman are  in our view  a guarantee of the success of this session  which is being held at a time when the international situation is of particular concern  both politically and economically.We wish also to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation of the very positive work accomplished by Mr. Paul Lusaka throughout his term of office as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.Lastly  we commend our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the constant and effective efforts that he has made in the service of peace and social and economic development and to ensure respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.The people of Guinea  under the guidance of the Military Committee for National Recovery  has embarked on the building of a democratic and prosperous society that respects fundamental human rights and freedoms.In keeping with the legitimate aspirations of our people  the Military Committee for National Recovery and the Government of the Second Republic have drawn up a program of action which is contained in an interim national development plan for 1985 to 1987. This interim plan focuses basically on agriculture  energy  education  transport and communication - in other words the restructuring of the economy and the administration.Since the development of agriculture and energy are among the priorities in our economic strategy  our efforts have focused on the search for ways and means of developing our vast natural resources. That is why we have embarked on an open-door policy which makes it possible for us to co-operate with all the countries of the world unconditionally and on the basis of equality and mutual interests  in the deep conviction that only such a policy of co-operation can prove viable and fruitful for Guinea and all its partners.In this respect we welcome the importance attached by the United Nations to the integrated development plan for the Fouta Djallon massif with a view to creating a protective green belt against the progressive desertification of our region and thus making its immense hydroelectric potential available to all the States of the region.Our new approach  which is reflected in a development-oriented diplomacy  will be supported within the country by a policy of freeing the economy and encouraging enterprises and private initiatives that were for a long time stifled.We believe that the record of the United Nations in its 40 years of existence can be considered positive. In fact  even though our objectives are not always achieved  we may well be pleased that the hopes aroused throughout the world bythe establishment after the Second World War of the united Nations persist. The maintenance and promotion of international peace and security remain the essential purpose of our Organization  which cannot tolerate the serious hotbeds of tension which still persist throughout the world.Among those serious hotbeds-of tension that command our attention  southern Africa and the Middle East are the most troubling because of the immense loss of life and the extent of the material damage involved. In southern Africa the racist regime of Pretoria is stepping up its defiance of the international community through its systematic  ferocious oppression of the black peoples of South Africa  its acts of aggression against neighboring countries and its persistent refusal to grant independence to Namibia.It is fitting here to reiterate our unconditional support for and active solidarity with the national liberation movements and the peoples that they represent.The interim government established in Namibia by the contemptible regime in South Africa  without a referendum and completely ignoring the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the nationalist movement recognized by the international community  has no legitimacy whatsoever and is therefore null and void.We take this opportunity to commend the position of the Western countries that have decided to impose sanctions against the apartheid regime.In the Middle East  the continuing illegal occupation of Arab territories by Israel  made worse by the fratricidal war in Lebanon  makes the prospect of a solution to the Palestinian question seem even less imminent. The Republic of Guinea reaffirms its firm support for the Palestinian people in its struggle under the leadership of its sole representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  to exercise its inalienable right to existence and to a national identity.As a member of the Islamic Peace Committee entrusted with seeking a peaceful solution to the Iran-Iraq conflict we believe  in spite of the obstacles encountered  that the common destiny of those two brother Moslem countries will lead them to cease hostilities for the sake of fraternal coexistence.With regard to the Cypriot question  the Republic of Guinea  as in the past  continues to support our Organization to bring about a just and negotiated solution.Other hotbeds of tension also Reserve our consideration. In Afghanistan  as in Kampuchea  we have before us a situation which continues to be of concern to the international community. The Government of the Republic of Guinea believes that the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples must be allowed to choose their own political system in complete freedom.Also in Asia  a new glimmer of hope has emerged as to the outcome of efforts to ensure the peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland. In this respect  we reaffirm the complete support of the Republic of Guinea for the steps already taken in many forums and organizations with a view to the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the transformation of the armistice agreement into a peace agreement.In respect of the Western Sahara  the Republic of Guinea supports unreservedly the right of peoples to self-determination in the spirit of United Nations resolution 1514 (XV) and therefore believes that the time has come for the current President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to join efforts in order to find at last an honorable solution to that painful conflict.In connection with Chad  that brother country which only wants to live in peace within its borders  we applaud and support the efforts made by the Congo to bring all parties in Chad around the same negotiating table.The peace and security that we all need and for which all of us struggle daily can only be obtained through the establishment of a- new international economic order  making trade equitable and bringing about a just distribution of benefits among States.^here can be no development of the peoples without meeting the primary needs of man through the complete economic development of nations in a climate of peace and security for all.In the context of the New International Economic Order  we wish to encourage the North-South dialog and to place particular emphasis on the need to promote South-South co-operation.The persistent economic recession which is creating increasing difficulties for the poor countries requires that the international community become more aware of the situation  otherwise its efforts to safeguard peace will be doomed to failure.We are also giving close attention to the problem of disarmament  at this time when we are witnessing the development of a new stage in the arms race. What do we see? The arms race  far from slowing down  has been increasingly extending into outer space. We believe that this question should not be discussed in a bilateral framework which places the United Nations at a secondary level. This question should be resolved in a universal framework where all the nations of the world can contribute to the preservation of mankind from a possible war of self-destruction.Peace is one and indivisible. The United Nations must without delay assume its full role in an undertaking as delicate as that of general and complete disarmament.Consequently  in view of the increasing enlargement of the sphere of activities of our Organization  it is essential to adapt its structures and its functioning to the demands of our day.Thus  we must recognize that the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular cannot fully and effectively play their role unless the Member States agree to give them complete responsibility in correctly implementing the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and of the rules of the Security Council.Ignorance  disease and hunger remain ills from which almost two thirds of the population of our world suffer  and it is on that sad note that we would like to make an urgent appeal to all nations for solidarity  above all to the most advantaged nations  so that they may demonstrate greater political will through practical action  in order to put an end to these scourges and ensure the survival of mankind.We endorse and firmly support the goal of the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund  that is  the universal immunization of children by the year 1990. As we all know  children represent mankind's most valuable resource."
"50",2808,"GRC",40,1985,"Let me at the very outset extend to Ambassador de Pinies of Spain my warmest congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly. The Greek Government is particularly happy with his election  seeing in him the representative of a country with which Greece maintains traditional bonds of friendship  both countries being Mediterranean neighbors. Moreover  we welcome the election of a person with long years of experiences in the United Nations and with great diplomatic skills and innate tact. These qualities ensure the success of his mission.I also wish to congratulate the outgoing President  Ambassador Lusaka  on the successful way in which he carried out his difficult task.It could be remiss of me not to refer at this point to the complex and demanding work of the Secretary-General. Devoted to his mission  in spite of the obstacles he encounters  he spares no effort to serve the cause of peace and to secure the best possible functioning of our Organization.Our thoughts turn at this time to the people of Mexico  who have been grievously tried by the earthquake that struck that country. In a hopeful sign of international solidarity  the world community has declared itself ready to assist the Government and people of Mexico at this moment of hardship. My country will offer assistance within its possibilities.The United Nations - that is to say  all of us - is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. The Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic  Mr. Papandreou  will be presenting to the General Assembly  in a few weeks  Greece's views on the future of the Organization. At this time  however  I should like to point out that the United Nations constitutes a highly important international forum. This is so not only because of the wide spectrum of participation in it or of the Organization's prestige but mostly because it provides mechanisms that can be of help in the cause of peace  on condition that the political will of States concurs. We should not  however  underestimate the importance of our Organization as a venue where it is possible to meet and to exchange views and ideas.For all these reasons  Greece has consistently supported the principle of the universality of the Organization. We hope that the obstacles still hindering the accession to membership of a very small number of States may be removed so that universality can be fully implemented.It is still  however  a sad fact that  40 years after the foundation of the United Nations  some of its basic principles remain in many cases dead letters. The United Nations has often confined itself to the role of passive observer of violations of its Charter. Interventions to resolve armed conflicts  when undertaken  have come late and focused rather on the external symptoms than on the real causes. We have  therefore  to find ways that will enable the Security Council to deal with conflicts from the very outset and establish procedures that will secure the implementation of the Council's resolutions.Nevertheless  the United Nations should not be blamed exclusively for not having succeeded  during its 40 years of existence  in preventing crises  wars and bloodshed. This is because the Organization is based essentially upon the political will of its Members and its effectiveness depends primarily on the orientation of their policies  especially those of the great Powers. That is why Greece  along with all other countries  particularly the smaller ones  is looking forward to the forthcoming meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev and expresses the hope that positive results will be achieved - because  to be quite frank about it  the policies of the two super-Powers  as well as the relationships between them  have a decisive impact upon the issues of international security. We sincerely hope that a sense of high international responsibility will prevail at that meeting  since a number of important issues depend on its outcome.The Foreign Minister of Luxembourg  Mr. Poos  President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  of which Greece is a member  has presented the views of the Community on various international problems. I should like  however  to refer to certain points on the agenda  stressing Greece's position on them.Unfortunately  this year's agenda still focuses on items such as international security and the closely related question of disarmament  the huge chapter of human rights  the issue of international economic disparities and violations of fundamental provisions of the Charter in the form of infringement upon the sovereignty of various States. That provides a sad and most alarming picture of world affairs. Will it be possible to achieve some progress  however modest  on these questions during this year's session of the General Assembly? As I have said  the answer will depend on the will of the Members of our Organization.As regards the main items on the agenda of the General Assembly  I should like to start by outlining the basic positions of the Greek Government concerning the issues of security and the arms race.Greece is deeply attached to the fundamental principles and ideals of the United Nations Charter and advocates the peaceful settlement of disputes  being convinced that security cannot be maintained in a climate characterized by recourse to force  military interventions  acts of aggression or occupation of territory by foreign troops.Security and disarmament are closely linked to each other. Therefore  strengthening international security cannot be achieved through increased armaments.Only the creation of a climate of mutual confidence in relations between States can lead to the solution of international security problems.We consider it necessary to reinforce the mechanisms of disarmament as well as all the efforts of the United Nations aimed at safeguarding peace and at eliminating the risks of a nuclear disaster.Greece is in favor of a mutual and gradual reduction of nuclear armaments by both the East and the West to the lowest possible level and supports all necessary efforts to that end  such as the adoption of effective means of verification.We are firmly opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons? Their introduction into outer space could lead to great tensions with grave consequences for mankind.Greece also attaches particular importance to the limitation of conventional armaments  not only because their accumulation has considerable economic repercussions on the peoples of the world but also because the existence of huge conventional arsenals could lead to local conflicts and possibly even to nuclear confrontation.We are deeply concerned about the proliferation and use of chemical weapons in violation of international commitments. For this reason we are convinced that the total ban on the production and use of these weapons as well as the complete destruction of existing stockpiles is one of the most important issues we face.I should not fail to mention  at this point  how significant disarmament is for economic growth  especially that of the less developed countries.Being a small country firmly attached to the cause of peace  not only out of necessity but also because of its long cultural tradition  Greece has no illusions as to its power to influence international developments in .a decisive manner. Nevertheless  the Greek Government believes that the cause of peace is of critical importance for the whole of the international community and therefore even smaller countries can contribute to it  both through their bilateral relations and through their overall policies.In this spirit of collective responsibility for world peace  Greece makes every possible effort to contribute towards detente at a local or wider level. Within this framework  the Prime Minister of Greece  Mr. Andreas Papandreou  together with the Heads of state or Government of Argentina  Mexico  the united Republic of Tanzania  India and Sweden  has joined in an appeal  the ""Initiative of the Six""  which calls for a freeze on the testing .	j.on and development of nuclear weapons and for the adoption of similar measures in the field of space weapons.In the same spirit  the Greek Government  while promoting bilateral relations  attaches particular importance to the situation in the Balkans  an area regarded only a few decades ago as the powder-keg of Europe. To this end  we are promoting the proposal to transform the Balkans into a nuclear-free zone. These efforts have not as yet yielded concrete results; nevertheless  positive steps have been taken in the direction of multilateral co-operation on security matters. In the bilateral field  Greece has also reached an enviable level of co-operation with most of its neighbors.Within this context Greece closely follows developments in the Mediterranean  a sea not only of the Balkan peninsula and of the rest of Southern Europe but also one that links three continents. The Mediterranean  therefore  receives directly repercussions from the various crisis points in the area. For these reasons  my Government fully supports every effort which could lead to the consolidation of peace  the expansion of co-operation and the unhindered development of all the Mediterranean peoples  so that the Mediterranean may one day become a sea of peace and not an area of military confrontation.Consistent with its overall policy in favor of peace and detente  my country has always supported the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process as a means of maintaining a dialog between East and West. We should like to reiterate our hope that existing differences will be finally overcome so that the Stockholm Conference may achieve its objectives in due course.I should like to refer  within the overall context of international peace and security  to another phenomenon which in recent years has repeatedly shocked the international community  that is to say  various cases of terrorist activity. The Greek Government categorically and unreservedly condemns these acts.Another question that deeply preoccupies my Government is the protection of human rights  namely  the well-established civil and political liberties and the social  economic and cultural rights. We see with great satisfaction that the United Nations continues its efforts in this field  without being discouraged by the many obstacles it encounters and the many flagrant violations of human rights that frequently occur all over the world. The last session of the General Assembly approved  by consensus  the international Convention against torture. We hope that this Convention will be universally respected.By enacting recently a special law categorizing torture as a criminal act  Greece has become a pioneer in the field of attempting to eradicate torture. Greece has also submitted recently to the Council of Europe a proposal aiming at the adoption of similar legislation on torture by the member states of this organization.The Nairobi world Conference of 1985  marking the end of the United Nations Decade for women  identified the obstacles as well as the achievements of the goals of the Decade. It adopted new strategies for the rest of the century which are designed to improve the status of women and to integrate them into all aspects of development.The Greek Government believes that  although the Decade has contributed substantially to a world-wide awareness of women's problems as well as to a greater understanding of their needs  the challenge remains. We still face the question as to hew to intensify our efforts for the adoption of concrete measures for the total eradication of discrimination based on sex  at the national  regional and international levels.We therefore hope that the spirit of compromise which prevailed at Nairobi will be maintained at the General Assembly for the adoption of the Forward-looking Strategies by consensus  as well as for the adoption of concrete measures for the implementation of the achievements of the Conference.The Greek Government is seriously concerned about the problem of international economic disparities. Foe third-world countries their excessive external debt is a major negative factor in their efforts to achieve development. A great part of their financial resources  which would otherwise be directed towards development targets  is spent in OEdeE to service their external debt. He consider that the adoption of long-term approaches would be the most appropriate method of coping with this problem. The stagnation regarding the North-South dialog is also particularly disturbing. We believe that no effort should be spared to overcome existing difficulties. Greece has consistently supported effoEts to EeinfoEce international solidarity aiming at a more balanced development of the international economy.The unprecedented drought and the subsequent famine which  particularly during the last year  have hit almost the entire African continent have aggravated the severe economic crisis as well as the tragic problem of the continent's nearly 5 million refugees. Despite this year's relative improvement in some areas  the rapid desertification of wide areas is still spreading and famine still exists. It was gratifying to see the international community take vigorous measures with a view to averting greater disasters.Unfortunately  all these efforts are but half-measures. Such disasters have occurred in the past and are bound to occur again. The only solution is through long-term structural reforms to support the fragile structures of the economies of the African countries  and also to enhance the effectiveness of the system designed to deal with the famine crisis and natural disasters. The fact that during our era of waste and affluence there are still people being deprived of the primary human right - the right to life - is a disgrace to our civilization. The Greek Government has taken action  within its capabilities  to assist in the relief of the distressed peoples of Africa  and will continue to do so for as long as the need is there.We have had no indication during the past year that solutions to the various problems which confront the United Nations are forthcoming. In fact  some of them - the situation in South Africa in particular - have deteriorated.During the past few months the international community has been hocked by developments in South Africa. The serious deterioration in terms of bloody clashes in South Africa  especially during the past year  which culminated in the proclamation of a partial state of emergency  urgently calls for immediate  practical and substantial measures on the part of the South African Government. It is now absolutely imperative that a real dialog be established between the South African Government and the authentic representatives of the non-white population of the country  directed towards the peaceful abolition of the inadmissible system of apartheid. The insistence by the Government of Pretoria on maintaining the inhuman system of apartheid has brought about  as expected  universal revulsion. Greece has repeatedly and in the strongest possible terms condemned this repugnant system reject any attempt by the South African Government to split the non-white majority  either by selectively granting nominal rights to parts of the population or through the continuation of its homelands policy.Last year we expressed the hope that the agreements concluded between south Africa and neighboring States could contribute to the normalization of the situation in the region. Unfortunately  the expectation that those agreements could contribute to a climate of dialog  peace and detente in the area has not materialized. During  the past year South Africa has continued its destabilization policy against neighboring States  particularly Angola and Mozambique - a policy which has been condemned by the Security Council and the entire international community. The front-line States should be given full international assistance so •>at they may safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity  and promote their economic and social development  which is now in jeopardy.The persistent refusal by South Africa to grant effective independence to Namibia constitutes an unacceptable offense against the will of the international community. It is the Greek Government's firm conviction that the question of Namibia can be solved only through the full  immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The Middle East problem dates from the very first years of our Organization. It may present itself occasionally under different aspects  but the substance of the problem remains always the same - how to find a way in which the Arab countries and Israel may coexist in peace.My Government's position on this problem is clear and has been repeatedly stated. We believe that the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied since 1967 is a sine qua ran in order to achieve a just and lasting solution  which will be beneficial not only to one side but to both parties to the conflict. We believe that the Palestinians  no less than all the other peoples on earth  are entitled to exercise fully the right to self—determination  including the right to create their own State. We believe that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has an essential role to play in the efforts to reach a solution to the problem - efforts in which all interested parties should participate.It goes without saying that sty Government  as well as supporting the rights of the Palestinian people  supports the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders.Greece attaches particular importance to the security of the inhabitants of the occupied territories  who have repeatedly had their rights violated during the past years. In the Middle East conflict  as in the Cyprus question  we condemn without reservation all efforts to impose faits accomplis. we condemn any form of violence against inhabitants of the occupied territories.During the past months we have observed increased activity on the Middle East problem. It may still be too early to tell whether those efforts will bear fruit. The Greek Government is watching those efforts closely and with great interest  and supports any initiative which would lead to a just  comprehensive and lasting solution.The situation in Lebanon causes us grave concern. We appeal to all the parties involved to cease this fratricidal struggle and devote themselves to the difficult task of reconciliation and the rebuilding of their country. We also call upon all-those who exert influence in Lebanon to make every effort to ensure that the confrontation ends so that Lebanon may deal with the problems of reconstruction as a unified  independent and sovereign State  with its territorial integrity unimpaired and its central authority extended over the whole territory of the Republic.The Greek Government strongly regrets the prolongation of the war between Iran and Iraq. Despite a certain decrease in military operations  the perpetuation of the war causes  among other things  heavy human and material losses  and is a constant threat to world peace. Greece  which maintains friendly relations with both parties  believes that only early negotiations can restore peace in the region. Greece is prepared to offer its good offices to help bring the war to an end.The Greek Government is also concerned with two cases of continuing foreign intervention in Asia: I am referring here to Afghanistan and Kampuchea. I should like to stress unequivocally that foreign troops in those countries should be withdrawn as soon as possible  in accordance with United Nations resolutions  so that those countries may regain their independence and non-aligned status. I should like  in this context  to praise the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat in general. I also express my appreciation for the efforts made by the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in order to promote a solution to the problem of Kampuchea.In Central America the situation remains fluid and gives cause for concern. We continue to believe firmly that a solution to the region's problems can be obtained only through peaceful means with significant steps in the social and economic fields.In its desire to contribute to the solution of those problems  ray country  as is known  participates with the other member states of the European Community in the common effort to help promote dialog with the countries of Central America  which started last year in San Jose. We look forward with particular interest to the continuation of the dialog with those countries  to be resumed at ministerial level in Luxembourg on 11 and 12 November. We support the efforts of the Contadora group  and we hope that the interested parties will show the necessary political will so that those efforts may lead  as soon as possible  to the signing of the Revised Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.We cannot but express our deep satisfaction over the recent developments in certain countries in South America. The transition of many South American countries from an authoritarian to a democratic regime of elected Governments constitutes a fact of great importance  which we all welcome. At the same time we express the wish that that process of democratization will extend to those South American countries which still do not enjoy a free democratic life  whose peoples are obliged to struggle for the conquest of democracy.I have left for the very end the issue which is of primary importance to my Government and also for Hellenism in general. I am referring to the Cyprus question. I shall be brief  both because it is for my colleague  the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Cyprus  to refer to the details of the problem and because the facts are more or less well known to all.Eleven years have passed since the Turkish army invaded Cyprus  and Turkey proceeded to the de facto dismemberment of the Republic by militarily occupying roughly 37 per cent of its territory and through the subsequent forced movement of the population. Ever since  the Turkish side has tried to impose an exceedingly complex and unyielding constitutional system in order not only to legalize partition but also to obtain effective control over the whole of the Republic. Turkey  furthermore  is trying to perpetuate the presence of its troops through the pretext of Turkish guarantees.To put it bluntly  Ankara wants in practice to make of the Republic of Cyprus a Turkish protectorate. If it were only a question of the security of the Turkish-Cypriot community  as Turkey claims  that could easily have been achieved through reinforced effective guarantees by the international community  as has repeatedly been proposed by the President of the Republic of Cyprus  supported by ray Government.For more than a year the Secretary-General has given the Cyprus question his particular and active attention. My Government has from the beginning supported  and it continues to support  the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus has shown good will and great flexibility  and has made concessions which may have gone beyond safe limits. Turkey  however  pursues in Cyprus its own geopolitical goals and therefore remains intransigent  raising completely unacceptable claims. It is against those goals that all efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem have foundered.The Greek Government has repeatedly stated that it supports a just and viable solution of the problem  to the benefit of all Cypriots  both Greek and Turkish. Furthermore  it has clearly stated that it would be inconceivable to contemplate any solution which did not entail the complete withdrawal of Turkish occupation troops from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus at the time of the agreement.We sincerely hope that the Secretary-General's efforts will succeed  so that at last there may be reached a solution guaranteeing the territorial integrity and the unity of the Cypriot State  in order that the whole Cypriot population may live according to established democratic principles  under conditions of freedom  justice and security.When States take an independent position vis-a-vis existing blocs  that is an invaluable contribution to the cause of peace  since it creates a balancing factor between opposing views. For that reason I should like to express once more the profound esteem of the Greek Government for the non-aligned countries and to express the hope that they will continue to affect positively the international situation  with cohesion and with a high sense of international responsibility.Greece continues to trust in the United Nations  in spite of its inevitable weaknesses. If Member States apply in practice the principles we unanimously adopted 40 years ago  we can hope for a better future. Our ultimate goal should remain world peace in freedom and justice."
"51",2896,"GTM",40,1985,"Mr. President  I am pleased on behalf of the people and the Government of Guatemala to offer you our most cordial congratulations on your election as President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that your personal qualifications as well as your full knowledge of international problems will guarantee the success of our deliberations and the progress which will no doubt be achieved in the work of this session. I am pleased to extend to you the full co-operation of my delegation in the difficult and important tasks which have been entrusted to you.I should also like to express the gratitude of my delegation for the excellent work carried out by Ambassador Paul Lusaka in his capacity as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session.May I also  on behalf of the people and the Government of Guatemala  and on behalf of the delegation over which I preside  offer a most cordial greeting to His Excellency  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of this Organization  and renew to him our support for the efforts he has been making to achieve peace and progress for the peoples.I should also like to greet the representatives to this Assembly  whose task it is to share in the efforts and responsibilities during this session of the General Assembly in order to make a positive contribution to the strengthening of the principles which inspire the Charter of the United Nations.In addition to the official condolences conveyed by my Government  I avail myself of this opportunity to renew our sympathy to the people and the Government of Mexico on the natural disaster suffered recently by that country  and to make an appeal to the Members of this Organization to lend their support to the extent possible to Mexico  as they did for Guatemala when an earthquake devastated our territory in 1976. Guatemala feels very close to the brotherly people of Mexico in this time of sorrow.On 26 June of this year we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco. As a founding member of this Organization  Guatemala has taken part in  encouraged and followed always very closely and with great interest the work of the Organization in the last 40 years. There is no doubt that the United Nations to some extent is the reflection of the problems and realities of the countries which make it up and therefore it can solve those problems in the extent to which States display a genuine political will to do so. We must therefore look back on the work of the most representative international Organization of our contemporary world and not only discuss with objectivity its achievements and failures but most importantly look at future possibilities to strengthen it so that it may eventually comply fully with the lofty goals for which it was established.The United Nations constitutes a body which enables peoples and Governments by means of ongoing dialog and relations to know each other better and also to share experiences and efforts in order better to deal with the complex problems which affect the international community in all fields.Clearly  this most important world political body is an arena for the promotion of an open dialog  and despite the differences between countries in ideology and in economic and social conditions  it may  within a framework of understanding and respect  provide the channels for co-operation which will benefit mankind as a whole.Despite its considerable limitations  this Organization still offers real hope for international coexistence and solidarity. Nevertheless  we must recognize that the expectations which went into the making of this multinational body have not always in practice been translated into tangible responses to the great challenge of maintaining international peace and security.While it is true that mankind has succeeded in avoiding a third world conflagration  which could lead to chaos and total destruction  we must also say that violence is still spreading and intensifying in many countries  regions and continents  leaving an increasing number of victims in its wake. These conflicts  unfortunately  have not been halted despite the constant appeals by our Organization.But in another order of ideas  the achievements of the Organization are also quite clear and meaningful in the scientific  humanitarian  technological  social  economic  cultural  conceptual and practical fields.We must admit to the fact that the United Nations  which is made up of different States  very often acts slowly in responding to crisis situations  and it is frustrating to see its inability speedily to arrive at the compromise formulas which are required by circumstances. There is no doubt that the creation of the United Nations is the expression of an act of faith by those countries which had suffered from the terrible scourge of the Second World War. It stems from the shared purpose of establishing a collective security system and a system of collective international co-operation.International relations at present are very different from those which existedin 1945. The number of states which have become independent has grown tremendously  and the Organization now has 159 members. At the same time different kinds of organizations have emerged over the years  not only regional or sub-regional organizations  but also organizations at the multilateral level  dealing with co-operation.Thus  in this complex context this international body has contributed in the last four decades to the quest for peace  co-operation  justice and development. No doubt  we are better prepared today to deal with various kinds of realities  because while it is true that poverty continues mercilessly to strike in all corners of the world  we have also witnessed the incredible and constant miracle of the progress of science and technology  the free and creative product of the human mind. And while it is true that man seems unable to forgo and rid himself of the germ of self-destruction  it is also true that man is capable of achieving the highest values which ennoble him and make him special  exceptional and unique. Therefore  we reaffirm our faith in man  so that man may freely and responsibly seek greater achievements and regain spiritual values  thus achieving the greatest benefits through his full development.It is that same man who constitutes the key element in the organization of States  and the sole and ultimate party responsible for coexistence and solidarity among peoples to which the United Nations contributes to some extent. We are aware of the fact that many factors aggravate the international crisis  particularly economic and financial factors  coupled with social and natural issues of dramatic proportions. But while we understand the complexity of the solutions required  we must not be discouraged but rather prepared to make whatever sacrifice may be required by circumstances.I would like to appeal to all Member States of the United Nations jointly to contribute to the achievement of the goals and objectives and put into effect fully the principles so clearly defined in the Charter signed in 1945.I should like now briefly to refer to the most salient aspects of the national and international policy of Guatemala. It is with great satisfaction that I venture to state before this Assembly that the promises made by the provisional and temporary Government of Guatemala two years ago have been carried out to the letter without any changes. We can reaffirm today that the process of democratization in Guatemala and the bringing about of a more open society is now becoming a reality. The new constitution was solemnly enacted on 31 May last  after 10 months of hard work by the National Constituent Assembly  which was elected on 1 July last year in free exemplary elections  where all citizens without any pressures came to the polls in unprecedented numbers in the political history of our country  thus demonstrating the true democratic ideals of our people.This electoral event  whose purity cannot be in doubt  made it possible for the 18 political parties and civilian committees to elect deputies representing various sectors and ethnic groups making up our society.The new constitution  which will come into effect on 14 January 1986  is in keeping with the most modern theories and trends of constitutional political law and regulates  with the proper checks and balances  the exercise of public power  as well as the administration and management of the business of state. It places special emphasis on the defense of our constitutional order and guarantees the establishment and functioning of political organizations so as to ensure the exercise of democracy by means of pluralism and the greatest possible participation.The new constitution recognizes and guarantees fully human rights and incorporates the texts of international treaties and conventions to which Guatemala is a party. We must also emphasize social rights which include the promotion of all issues relating to ethnic groups  thus stimulating and promoting their associations and organizations in order to ensure their full development.Our Constitution also includes the establishment of a Guatemalan equivalent of an office of defender of human rights through the setting up of a commission and an attorney-general for human rights  enjoying broad powers not only to promote and facilitate governmental action in this area  but also to counter improper administrative conduct and publicly to condemn actions which run counter to constitutional rights.The National Assembly continues to function and has been mandated by the people to decree permanent electoral laws  as well as the law of ""amparo""  the habeas corpus law and constitutional law  which we hope will be issued at the end of this year. In early June the Government called for general elections which will take place on 3 November and  as was done last year  we have invited observers of international organizations  of friendly countries  as well as journalists and political and academic figures  to witness the event in which the President and Vice-President of the Republic will be elected  as well as deputies to the National Congress  mayors and members of all municipal entities in the country.If no presidential candidate obtains an absolute majority  there will be a second electoral round  on 8 December  between the two candidates that will have received the largest number of votes.After the deadline for registration of candidates has been reached  the people of Guatemala will have clear choices of a wide range of ideologies.For the first time in the political history of Guatemala  we have eight presidential candidates  all of them civilians. The Government of Guatemala maintains absolute neutrality in the electoral process and has granted all the necessary facilities for this purpose  so that the political parties may conduct their campaigns in an appropriate climate without any kinds of limitations.All this leads us to believe that in November there will be a larger number of voters than those that came to the polls last July  when 73 per cent of our citizens voted. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal  which is independent from other State bodies  will be collecting and counting the votes and issuing the results.All of the above summarizes the situation in Guatemala as it obtains now and the decisive steps which we have taken for a return to democratic institutions. Our Government takes this opportunity to express its profound recognition to the friendly countries which have constantly demonstrated to us not only their interest but also their solidarity and support for the process in which we are engaged.The people of Guatemala wants to exercise its legitimate right to choose freely its future leaders in peace and tranquility without outside interference. Therefore my people wishes its right to self-determination respected and thus it strongly and energetically rejects and denounces any attempt by purely minority totalitarian sectors  supported and encouraged from the Outside  to obstruct the voting procedure by means of destabilization  violence  intimidation and terrorism. We have not the slightest doubt that these actions are repudiated by an overwhelming majority of Guatemalans  who  like other Latin Americans  are determined to consolidate their democratic institutions on the continent.In the period 1980 to 1982 Guatemala experienced ? resurgence of subversive violence  which compelled thousands of Guatemalans to abandon their communities of origin and move to safer areas. Many of them chose to cross the border into Mexico  where they settled in camps. The solution of this problem in an overall and definitive fashion is a major concern of the present government. Along these lines we have held talks with the Government of Mexico and contacted the Mexican Red Cross  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the League of Red Cross Societies  in co-operation with the Guatemalan Red Cross  so as to implement agreed procedures to facilitate the return of our compatriots to Guatemala in a voluntary and orderly fashion  not only giving them the protection they require but also creating the conditions to enable them to return to their usual occupations and  if possible  to their communities of origin  so that they could be incorporated in productive activity  thus actively participating in the development of our country.I am pleased to report that thousands of refugees in recent years have voluntarily returned to Guatemala by their own means. However  according to the figures supplied by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and theauthorities of the Mexican Government  there still remain approximately 46 000 refugees  mostly women and children  in Mexico.The pacification of what was earlier called ""areas of conflict"" at present makes it possible to give the displaced Guatemalans the services and infrastructure necessary for their personal well-being  including among other things food assistance  housing  health assistance and training for productive activities particularly in agriculture  and thus we hope that in the near future consultations will make it possible for them finally to return  so that they may exercise their legitimate right to live in peace in the land in which they were born.The respect and full implementation of human rights must remain one of the main concerns of Governments  since their observance is fundamental to the achievement of the well-being and security of peoples. Hence it is essential to create the necessary conditions and take the necessary measures to protect and guarantee the exercise of individual as well as social human rights recognized by the international community. Unfortunately  in the recent past my country has been in one way or another the victim of violence and terrorism promoted from outside  with the ensuing negative effects in regard to human rights. Despite all the difficulties and adverse factors  considerable improvement has taken place in Guatemala in this area and the level of violence has considerably decreased.Guatemala is continuing its ""open door"" policy  a policy of unconditional co-operation with all governmental and non-governmental humanitarian agencies interested in the promotion of human rights  and therefore we have provided to them all the necessary facilities so that their representatives may visit our country and ascertain directly and personally the true situation there. A special reference should be made to the visit of the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission of Human Rights  Viscount Colville de Culross  who has received every co-operation and has been able to interview leaders and representatives of all social sectors  including  among others  politicians  trade unionists  religious leaders  academics and government authorities. Thus he has been able  without any limitation  to go through our territory and gain first-hand information and knowledge about the true situation. He have also received a visit from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and many delegations from private entities  which  like any Guatemalan citizen  have enjoyed every possible freedom of action and movement to carry out their mandates. He are truly interested in ensuring that the realities in Guatemala are known world-wide so as to thwart the systematic campaigns of dogmatic political groups interested in presenting a negative image of our country  in a gesture of goodwill  Guatemala accepted the renewal of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  who has been dealing with the realities in our country for three years. He want it to be known that our Government has a positive attitude in this regard and this I feel is the right time to appeal to the international community for its full co-operation towards our new Government which will take power next year  and we hope it will not be necessary to renew at that time the mandate of a Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for Guatemala.He also take this opportunity to call upon the world Organization to depoliticize debate on human rights and to abandon the practice of selective treatment in this matter. In its unacceptable to treat States with different yardsticks regarding human rights. It is absurd to single out for censure some small countries while others which are engaged in flagrant violations and are involved in military or economic alliances with powerful nations are left alone. The latter are not even mentioned in this forum  much less criticized.The Government of Guatemala  presided over by General Oscar. Humberto Mejia Victores  has maintained a steadfast policy of respect for the principles and norms of international law and the principles and purposes of the Charter of the world Organization- particularly with regard to the sovereign equality of States  the territorial integrity  independence and self-determination of peoples  non-intervention  the maintenance of international peace and security  the promotion of and full respect for human rights and the strengthening of co-operation among nations. In keeping with these tenets  we have always had our own dynamic international policy based on moderation  acting in solidarity with just causes.The Central American region has for some time been suffering from a profound crisis which has affected it at all levels and which stems from different factors  internal as well as external. Never before in our history have we had to deal with a combination of so many adverse elements. There are serious political  economic and social problems which lead to tensions and confrontations and affect all the countries of Central America. Peace and security are seriously threatened by a worsening of internal conflicts which generate friction between countries  with the danger of generalized confrontation whose consequences cannot be foreseen. It would seem ironic that Central America  this great homeland of ours  united through history and with a common destiny which seemed quite promising  with integration systems that have functioned in an exemplary manner for the past quarter of a century creating development and trust  has in the past few years been afflicted by a climate of uncertainty  misunderstanding and distrust.Nevertheless  hope for understanding and reconciliation is emerging. Indeed dialog and communication are maintained  and it is with renewed efforts that the Contadora group continues to provide its most valuable mediation services. This truly Latin American peace plan  which enjoys the full support of the international community  has made it possible for Central Americans to maintain negotiations with a view to finding formulas for the alleviation of tension and to bring about lasting peace in the region. Guatemala firmly believes in the process of the Contadora group  which  with the greatest objectivity and a clear vision of the potential scope of the crisis in Central America  has proposed formulas based on norms and principles of international law  taking into account the specific conditions prevailing in the area. We must mention  as one of the major achievements of this negotiation process  in which there has always existed frank and open dialog  the consensus of Central American Governments and the adoption of the Document of Objectives  with 21 points  fully covering principles and commitments which could ensure peace in Central America.Recently we have been given a revised version of this Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America to be considered and discussed by plenipotentiaries in a period of 45 days. This document  which has been revised and perfected in the light of contributions by the Central American Governments  is  in my opinion  a document which could become a binding juridical instrument. The Central American Governments and the Contadora Group must know that Guatemala will maintain its constructive attitude and that it will continue to lend its support so that the Act may enter into force as soon as possible.Guatemala has welcomed the creation of a group for the political support of the Contadora Group consisting of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay which  during the meeting held by their respective Ministers for Foreign Affairs at the invitation of the President of Colombia  Mr. Belisario Betancur  in Cartagena on 24 and 25 August of this year  outlined the important tasks which will be carried out for the purpose of seeking formulas for substantive and definitive solutions for the problems of Central America.The contribution of the countries forming the support group is of supreme importance for the peace process promoted by the Contadora Group because it introduces into the negotiations a new dynamic factor  a very authoritative  credible and well-respected factor  namely the support of Latin America in the efforts for the establishment and consolidation of peace  democracy and economic and social development in Central America.Finally  with regard to Contadora  Guatemala would like to express its recognition for the admirable efforts made by the Group on behalf of Central America for almost three years.Guatemala's determination to see Central America achieve integration is well known. This has been the traditional policy of ray country in the region  for weremain convinced that fraternal peoples sharing the same historical destiny cannot live separated from each other. We have much in common and have achieved much together. Despite the political crisis  the scheme for Central American integration is still alive. We are convinced that  even in the context of the existing structural problems in the region  this process is a proper strategy to promote the joint development of the Central American countries within the framework of mutual respect and recognition of the specific characteristics of each and every one of its members. In other words  we accept and recognize unity in diversity.The regional institutions have been working properly; the ministers of the five countries involved meet often to discuss and solve common problems; and  recently  following difficult negotiations  we have signed an agreement establishing common tariffs in Central America. This will be a most important instrument of development within the policy of regional integration.I would like to point out that  in light of the profound crisis confronting Central America  the co-ordination and harmonization of the actions of the five Central American countries with respect to the rest of the world is becoming increasingly relevant.The historic meeting which we held one year ago in San Jose de Costa Rica with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Communities  Spain and Portugal  together with the Ministers of the Contadora Group  has been a major contribution in this effort and has opened new options for our peoples. We hope that the next meeting  which will be held in November in Luxembourg  will be not only one more step forward in this historical encounter with the members of the European Communities but will also be an opportunity to reaffirm the integrationist bent and political will of the participants to give effect: to the purposes and principles of the Joint Decleration of San Frisco.Like all the developing countries  Guatemala has also been affected by the current international economic crisis to which references have been made by the personalities and delegations who have spoken in this General Assembly. There can be no doubt that  in order to overcome this situation  which seems to be a chronic one  it is indispensable further to strengthen multilateral co-operation  particularly in those areas which are interrelated  such as finance  debt and trade. Only through political will on the part of the developed countries in this multilateral effort will we be able to reach a solution of this crisis  which gives rise to so many difficulties and affects the well-being of our peoples.For Guatemala the crisis is acute indeed. External debt  the drop in the prices of our exports  the investment retrenchment  the flight of capital  the progressive erosion of the external value of our money  the negative growth rate.  and unemployment create political and social tensions which threaten the current process of democratization and endanger the stability and future of my country.Hence  Guatemala  in addition to the internal efforts which it is making  is following attentively and taking part in the multilateral initiatives which are being taken for the purpose of finding viable solutions to these problems. We therefore support the Cartagena consensus to hold a multilateral meeting with the industrialized countries to eliminate those factors which give rise to the monetary  financial and trade crisis which besets us.Latin America is confronting a very complex crisis in a very confusing world. To face up to this crisis we cannot fail to emphasize the importance of the problem of external debt. That is why there must be reasonable negotiations between debtors and creditors  which would take all factors into account. In this connections Latin America calls for a political dialog  because we feel that it is not right to sacrifice the development of its peoples to service the debt under such rigid conditions  we hope that the industrialized nations will adopt a realistic and understanding attitude because a Latin America in which economic problems are out of control is a political problem for the rest of the world. We therefore repeat our concern at this grave situation  which is serious also for the entire international community.I should like now to refer to the still unsettled question of Belize. Guatemala in all good faith has held informal exploratory talks with the United Kingdom with the participation of representatives of Belize in order to find a just and honorable solution which will satisfy and safeguard the legitimate interests and rights of the parties involved. Guatemala  as has been done earlier  reiterates its firm will to continue such negotiations with an open mind and a constructive attitude in order to achieve points of agreement which will make it possible to lay the foundations for a definitive settlement. We are convinced that a sincere dialog must be pursued to promote understanding between the parties. We expect that our positive and realistic attitude will be reciprocated  and we expect that the other party will unequivocally display the political will necessary for a solution.Nevertheless  the Government of Guatemala wishes once again to state that it reserves its rights over the territory of Belize as long as the dispute has not been resolved. Consequently  we do not recognize either the independence of Belize  or the State of Belize  or its alleged sea or land frontiers. We also wish to repeat that we intend to promote and strengthen economic  social and cultural relations with the people of Belize in order to promote better understanding- and mutually beneficial co-operation.In connection with the question of the Malvinas  we support the Latin American position on this problem. We note that talks between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina have not led to any final result on the dispute between the two parties  we again appeal for a renewed dialog between them in compliance with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations so as to give effect to Security Council resolution 502 (1982).With regard to the situation in Kampuchea  we repeat that the people of the country themselves have the exclusive right freely to determine their destiny and that there must be an unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces  to guarantee the country's effective independence  territorial integrity and the exercise of its sovereignty.The Government of Guatemala is gratified by the renewal of talks between the Red Cross of South Korea and North Korea  the economic talks seeking bilateral co-operation and cultural  artistic and other exchanges which have been taking place. These and other developments will promote a dialog with a view to the eventual reunification of Korea  an outcome which should definitely be supported by the international community.My Government believes that South Korea and North Korea should be admitted as Members of the United Nations  if they so request  so that they also may take part in united Nations efforts to maintain international peace and security and strengthen international co-operation.The war which is still being waged between Iran and Iraq is a source of grave concern to the international community. The protracted and intensified conflict places the peace and stability of the region  in grave jeopardy. We therefore insist that the parties involved bring about a cessation of hostilities so that a satisfactory solution can be found. Guatemala also regrets the great losses of human life and material damage caused by the war.In relation to the Middle East  Guatemala expresses solidarity with the people of Lebanon suffering from the painful impact of violence and fratricidal confrontation. We believe that to restore a climate of concord and peace it is necessary immediately to withdraw all foreign forces from the occupied territory. Also  we believe that peace in the region must be based on mutual respect and that there must be recognition of and respect for the independence of the State of Israel  without denying the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to settle in their own territory.The General Assembly and the Security Council have devoted more than 20 years in a quest for a solution to the problem of Namibia  on which several resolutions have been adopted demanding independence for the Territory. Guatemala believes that sufficient time has elapsed and that all ways have been explored for an orderly and peaceful transition of Namibia to independent life  within a united and integral territory. We believe that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) represents the only acceptable basis for the peaceful and final solution of the question of Namibia.Guatemala categorically condemns the racist policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of South Africa  which is an attack on human dignity and fundamental human rights  we believe that the situation which prevails in southern Africa is intolerable  and the international community cannot permit it to continue. We are at one with those who are suffering from the effects of that reprehensible system. We expect good results from the efforts undertaken by the United Nations in implementation of the Program of Action for the Second Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.Guatemala is a profoundly peaceful country and expresses its concern and alarm in this international forum at the escalation of the arms race.My country is a party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which proscribes the introduction and use of nuclear arms in Latin America. Thus we support all the initiatives to declare nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions of the world and understand the fears of those countries which have denounced nuclear tests in places from which they can be seriously affected.Guatemala addresses an appeal to the nuclear Powers to limit and avail themselves of the research of nuclear technology solely for peaceful purposes  for the benefit of mankind  and abstain from the production  stockpiling and use of any type of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.Disarmament talks between the super-Powers are crucial and we hope for positive results.Also  we believe it is absurd and nonsensical to invest fabulous sums in arms when millions of human beings are suffering from hunger and poverty. This shows in dramatic terms the reality of a world in which some nations believe that peace must be achieved by means of a balance of forces or nuclear terror. The developing countries cannot fail to speak out most resolutely against such policies and demand that these huge sums of money be invested in assistance and support programs and development projects  with a clear sense of international justice.I also express my Government's profound concern at the resurgence of terrorism which has become international practice. I express most energetically our condemnation and repudiation of such acts of cruelty which are completely inhumane and absolutely unjustifiable. No Government  organization  association  entity or individual can morally invoke any pretext whatsoever to justify the commission of such acts. In the course of this year we have seen with horror repetitions of acts of this nature that have affected many countries and have been denounced by the international community. Unfortunately  the Central American region has not been spared such irrational acts  and a sister country - El Salvador - which has suffered from them deserves our special solidarity in connection with the kidnapping of President Duarte's daughter by a terrorist group.We repeat before this General Assembly our profound concern at the fact that the question of Afghanistan has not yet been resolved. We believe that the presence of foreign occupation forces in that country is in violation of the most elementary principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and international law and endangers the peace and security of that region. A solution of the problem of Afghanistan requires respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and non-aligned status of that country. We support the General Assembly resolutions 37/37  38/29 and 39/13 which reaffirm that the Afghanistan has the right to decide its own form of Government and choose its own political  economic and social systems  without foreign interference  coercion or limitation of any kind  and that the interested parties should co-operate with the United Nations to achieve a political solution that will respect the will of the Afghan people and achieve an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of that country.Guatemala supported the decision to declare 1985 ""International Youth Year; Participation  Development and Peace""  recognizing the importance for all of us to focus world-wide attention on the needs of young people throughout the world owing to the vital role that they are called upon to play in the quest for a more just  equitable and peaceful world. We believe that the principles and tenets which inspire the Charter of the United Nations are a guide for youth to become aware of their responsibilities and the role that they will have to play in the world of tomorrow.Likewise  Guatemala supports the recent resolution of the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) which decided on the goal of universal immunization of children by 1990  by accelerated action in accordance with objectives already established by the world Health Assembly.We cannot ignore the terrible problem of drugs which affects  to a greater or lesser extent  almost all countries of the world. Trafficking in narcotic drugs which has increased in recent years  constitutes a serious threat to the international community which it must confront with courage and determination. There is no doubt that that terrible scourge which affects particularly the young must be controlled by joint efforts of those countries where it is produced  distributed and consumed. It is a common task that requires a commitment. The developed countries  where there is the greatest consumption of the drugs  must give special support and assistance to countries which are working for their eradication and crop substitution so as not to affect their development.In concluding my statement  I call on all to look serenely and dispassionately on the major lessons of mankind's history so as to profit from experience and assess events in the light of circumstances  determining mankind's successes and failures. The United Nations  on its fortieth anniversary  is ending one stage and continuing on its long journey towards peace  justice and development. It is with the utmost objectivity that we must assess the possibilities for making the fullest possible use of the tools available to us to fashion the future by means of concerted effort and embracing the commitment to strengthen and further improve our Organization.Society - as well as man  the fundamental element of that society - is in a constant process of evolution  obeying a dynamic which is part ef its own energy and  thus  we must have confidence and faith to confront with creativity the new challenges arising before the international community."
"52",2941,"GUY",40,1985,"My first duty - which is a pleasant one - is to extend felicitations and congratulations to you  Sir  a distinguished son of Spain  upon your unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I pledge the full co-operation o£ my delegation in your effort to make this important fortieth session of the General Assembly a distinctive and successful one.Let me pay a special tribute also to your illustrious predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  for his responsible and devoted service and for the impartial manner and serene dignity with which he discharged his duties as President.May I also reaffirm our abiding support for our Secretary-General  whose qualities as an astute diplomat and an untiring devotee of the cause of internationalism are well known and widely respected. Once again  the Secretary-General has given us in his annual report a penetrating analysis of the present international situation and eminently constructive ideas as regards the need for co-operative global action.The opening of this general debate has coincided with a tragedy of unspeakable proportions which has befallen our sister Latin American and Caribbean Republic of Mexico in the series of earthquakes which that country has suffered. I wish to utilize the opportunity offered by this public forum to reiterate the sentiments of regret and solidarity which were conveyed by my President  His Excellency Comrade Hugh Desmond Hoyte  to the President of the Republic of Mexico  His Excellency Miguel de la Madrid and to the Government and people of Mexico. Guyana is confident that the strength and courage which the Mexican people have demonstrated throughout their history will enable them soon to overcome the effects of this cruel disaster  with the help of the international community  and to resume without undue delay their task of nation-building.We are now at the mid-point of the decade of the 1980 s  which I suggest is an appropriate point at which to examine how we have fared during the first half of this decade  to do so against the background of our performance in the previous decade and to make a prognosis for the remainder of this decade and beyond.In looking back at the 1970s  we should recall that it was the period when detente between the super-Powers was initiated. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries welcomed that development and called for measures to sustain it and to make it global. It was the period when the first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament was held and much hope was engendered that  through a series of interlocking activities  the survival of the peoples of the world would not be in jeopardy and tomorrow would be a better day.The 1970s also witnessed a dramatic reduction of formal colonialism  for the intolerably long suffering of countries in Africa  the Caribbean and elsewhere came to an end and their peoples were once again free.The hopes which the 1970s created were also reflected in the field of international economic relations. The adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Establishment of the New International Economic Order and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States was an acknowledgment by the international community that global economic expansion could be secured only if economic relations among States were conducted on a just and equitable basis and the structural problems of developing countries were eliminated.In the same vein  recognition must be given to the significant role which this Organization has played in fostering international co-operation in other fields. I think of the areas of human settlements  the role of women  the law of the sea and the protection of the environment as prime examples.I suggest that it would be apposite to recall also the new relationships which were forged at the interregional  regional and subregional levels. The African  Caribbean and Pacific Countries and the European Economic Community engaged in intensive negotiations and the agreements reached  despite their imperfections  ushered in a different relationship. In my own region  the establishment of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) was a bold attempt to advance regional economic co-operation.Finally  the period of the 1970s was a time when there was a growing appreciation of the nature of interdependence and that that interdependence should be based on symmetric relations between States and between peoples. In accordance with that acknowledgment of interdependence  Member States recognized that some problems required global solutions because of their very scope. This Organization was therefore increasingly utilized in the service of all mankind in finding such solutions.Unhappily  in the first five years of this decade the promise of the 1970s has not been fulfilled. Generally  in inter-State relations there is a certain primitiveness which stands in marked contrast to the spirit and accomplishments of the 1970s. It mocks the efforts expended over the years to establish a democratic international system  including a body of laws and rules carefully elaborated for the conduct of international relations. The major pillars of such a system are respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States; the self-determination of peoples; the non-use or threat of use of force; non-interference in the internal affairs of States; collective security; and multilateral co-operation on an equitable basis.Sadly  so far in this decade we have seen those principles observed too often in the breach. The independence of small States has not been respected and the fabric of international co-operation has been subjected to a sustained assault. And there are increasing indications of ideological intolerance in international relations.In the field of disarmament the second special session yielded even more meager results than its precursor. Meanwhile the arms race continues apace with the preparation for war consuming more financial resources than does any activity directed at strengthening peace or promoting development. The prospect of nuclear annihilation is now a major international concern. Yet in some Kafkaesque manner the existence of this common threat has not yet produced the unity of response that such a process demands. The sad reality is not only that the arms race continues on earth but also that concrete actions have begun which  if pursued to finality  will invite the result of making outer space an arena of military competition and confrontation.The prime requirement of our time is the curbing of the arms race. In this respect a heavy responsibility devolves on the nuclear Powers  especially the United States and the Soviet union. He have noted the stated positions of these two Powers  including their desire to engage seriously in arms negotiations and their awareness of the consequences of failure not only to themselves but to all of us.Guyana has views on their past behavior  but this not my concern on this occasion. Instead  today my desire is to add Guyana's voice  small but clear and sincere  to the many others heard from this rostrum to urge that the forthcoming Geneva summit talks be more than an exercise in establishing contact between the two leaders. These talks must be purposeful and constructive. The opportunity for them to usher in new and more structured relations between the two Powers should not be allowed to slip away.To turn to the question of decolonization  the prolonged frustration of the independence of Namibia exemplifies the resistance of some States to the decisions which truly represent the will of the international community. We should not be deflected by linkage or any other irrelevant consideration in our determination to secure implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Additionally  pressure should be brought to bear on South Africa to ensure its compliance with that resolution. In this regard let us commend the masses  led by the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia  for exerting decisive pressure on the Pretoria regime to dismantle apartheid and to respect the rights of all the peoples of South Africa and Namibia. The duty of this Organization is to support them. Mandatory economic sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations should be applied during this session.In other areas of the world  situations of tension and crisis with which this Organization was preoccupied in the 1970s are still on the international agenda. Since then  new problems have emerged.In the Middle East the essential elements for a comprehensive and lasting settlement are well known. The key to peace remains the satisfaction of the legitimate Palestinian aspirations  including their right to a homeland. And let us here condemn the brutal attacks by the criminal Israeli forces on Tunisia and on the Palestinian headquarters. Further opposition to the convening of an international peace conference called for by this Assembly and involving the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestinian people  led by the Palestine Liberation Organization  only serves to prolong suffering and delay a settlement.Similarly with Cyprus  whose independence and territorial integrity continue to be violated  a viable framework for a solution already exists in the relevant United Nations resolutions. The Secretary-General has been patient in carrying out the mandate assigned to him. We commend his efforts and urge all Member States and the representatives of the two communities in Cyprus to give their fullest co-operation to him in his renewed endeavors.It in Central America and the Caribbean that we see the most poignant manifestation of ideological intolerance. The social and economic situations of the peoples of this subregion have been exploited and manipulated by powerful external forces in the name of protecting them against the intrusion of an alien ideology. The result is tension  instability and a situation where peace and security are gravely imperiled.Guyana believes that the struggles of the peoples of Central America are against centuries of neglect and disadvantage and that the problems in the relations between States in that region should be solved through dialog and negotiation and not through the use of military force  whether directly or by proxies. That is why Guyana believes that the Contadora process deserves real and practical  as opposed to rhetorical  support by all members of the international community. For our part  we have given our wholehearted and consistent support to that process and to talks of a bilateral nature involving States within the region and between those States and interested parties outside it. Guyana also urges this Assembly to stand ready to facilitate the initiatives for peace in Central America which emerge from and have the blessing of the peoples of that subregion. Among other things this Assembly should give its endorsement to and encourage the work of the Contadora support group.The prospects for securing progress in establishing a new international economic order and achieving sustained growth in the world economy are diminished by the current retreat from multilateralism and by the reluctance to engage in discussion about global negotiations which  if launched on a mutually agreed basis  could constitute a comprehensive means by which the international community can restructure international economic relations while simultaneously strengthening multilateral economic co-operation.At the same time  some developed States are willing to do no more than tinker with the international trade and payments system in spite of its many defects and inability to respond with any degree of accuracy or consistency to the needs of the majority of the international community. Though the reality of interdependence has become more obvious with the lingering economic crisis  its requirements are being ignored by some rich and powerful States as they seek to exert greater control over international economic relations.A critical factor in the troubled international monetary and financial system is the problem of debt facing the developing countries. It is a problem that has already been forcefully and eloquently addressed at this Assembly.Let us hope that we can at this session reach conclusions that will reflect the spirit of international co-operation that was evident in the 1970s.Linked to the capacity to repay debts is the fact that the commodities traded by developing countries have been afflicted by low prices  weak demand and the managed contraction of markets in the developed world. This problem has had an adverse impact on the quality of life in many developing countries. What is required of the international community is increased co-operation in the formulation of international commodity policy  including the improvement of stabilization schemes.Unfortunately  these negative postures on the part of some developed countries extend to this Organization and its specialized agencies in their articulation of programs of economic co-operation among developing countries. We of the developing world  however  have not relaxed our efforts  and the record will show that co-operation among countries of the South at various levels continues to increase and to be intensified.Guyana will not retreat from its commitment to internationalism. That is why we again urge those developed countries which have stood aside in the past or taken steps to frustrate international action in this respect to alter their positions and join those of us promoting genuine all-round development.In addition to these situations  there are at least two issues which are causing increasing international concern. I refer to the abuse of and trafficking in drugs  and terrorism. As regards the latter  the Secretary-General has reminded us in his annual report on the work of the Organization that ""some of the necessary international legal instruments are in place"" (A/40/1  p. 15) . We must not only resolve to implement these instruments fully but also decide whether additional measures for international co-operation are required and can be agreed upon. Last year this Assembly adopted a far-reaching resolution against State terrorism  which helped in clarifying the issues. As we continue to address this subject  we have to ensure that action is not proposed as part of an ideological crusade  for this is bound to complicate the search for agreed solutions.On the question of drugs  Guyana supports the Secretary-General's proposal that a global conference should be convened to deal with all aspects of drug abuse and illicit trafficking. While we welcome and look forward to the holding of such a conference  we must nevertheless emphasize that the problem of drugs cannot be approached in an isolated manner.For many States and peoples the intensification of drug abuse is not unrelated to social and economic conditions. This connection must certainly be taken into consideration in any meaningful international approach to the question. It is therefore our hope that the nature and extent of the drug problem will encourage an appreciation of the urgency of the need for dialog leading to international co-operation over a much wider field  as developing countries have been calling for over the years.As we look forward in our search for peace and international co-operation  I wish to leave this Assembly with two thoughts.The first relates to sports. The Olympic Games were in this decade infected by some most distressing attitudes which deepened divisions between peoples and between States. Of course there can be no compromise with apartheid in this regard. There are already existing instruments and  hopefully  during this session we can adopt the draft International Convention against Apartheid in Sports  which has been so carefully and elaborately prepared. However  I ask the question: can the Olympic Games not be used in the future to promote reconciliation and understanding between peoples and States  and thus serve the cause of peace? In view of the holding of the forthcoming Olympics in Korea  can they not be employed in a positive and constructive way to foster a climate which will facilitate the search for a solution to the problem of the divided Korean peninsula?The second thought relates to decolonization. This Organization has been correctly applauded for its contribution to decolonization. But in rightly focusing our attention on the need to bring a formal end to political colonialism  a few vestiges of which remain  may we not have underplayed or even overlooked some consequences of colonialism which persist to this very day and which have a negative impact on inter-State relations and on the capacity of the United Nations adequately to fulfill its purposes? For colonialism affected both the colonizer and the colonized. One obvious legacy is the pervasiveness of underdevelopment and the instability which it causes. The other  which is no less disturbing  is the continuing manifestation  oft times insidious  of attitudes  postures and policies akin to those of the colonizer. Action at both the national and international levels to alter permanently these adverse conditions will enhance international co-operation  peace and security.From its inception the Non-Aligned Movement had as its overriding objective a world of free and equal sovereign States conducting their relations  among themselves and through institutions which they had created  in a democratic manner. That is why the Non-Aligned Movement has never wavered in its stand against imperialism  colonialism  racism and alien domination  and has always been a vigorous advocate of the democratization of international relations.During the 1970s our Movement strengthened its internal mechanisms for seeking the acceptance of its recommendations and decisions in this Assembly and elsewhere; and we have maintained that activism to this very day.The Non-Aligned Movement has been and will always be an inveterate campaigner for peace and for equitable development based on mutual benefit. When our Heads of State or Government last met in New Delhi in 1983  they articulated a multifaceted program of action affecting not only co-operation among non-aligned countries but many of the burning issues  the solutions of which require open and meaningful international co-operation. The response by the international community to several of these initiatives  however  has not always been positive. That notwithstanding  the Movement sought to carry forward the work of the summit meeting at the Conference of Foreign Ministers held recently in Luanda  Angola.The members of the Non-Aligned Movement believe that the Luanda Declaration provides an adequate framework and concrete proposals for action at this Assembly.The Movement will judge the attitudes of the rest of the membership of this Organization by their reaction to our efforts to get accepted at this Assembly the Movement's proposals for international co-operation and for action on specific issues.We are not inflexible and we will remain ready  as always  for negotiations which are honestly and sincerely embraced. Such negotiations should have as a primary objective the harmonization of the manifold interests of all our States  a fundamental purpose of the Charter  what we cannot negotiate are the principles which are the bedrock of our Movement's solidarity - principles which I dare say are universal in character. Let us demonstrate during the period of this  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  that we  as a collectivity  are equal to the task."
"53",2985,"HND",40,1985,"On 25 April 40 years ago a close observer of the city of San Francisco related how there was a gathering of representatives of various states  some of which had a proud past  while others had been in century-long isolation  with cultures that had changed little; some had been overwhelmed by the chaos of war  while others had just begun to move along the paths of history. The differences between the countries  both spiritual and material  were reflected in the flowing robes of the desert  the saris and the turbans. They were meeting under the aegis of peace and the most generous hopes for the building of a new and different world which would draw inspiration from the shattering experience mankind had lived through until then. It was said that men at long last had learned through bitter experience that the Tower of Babel could be built  and it was hoped that this time it would reach to the sky.At the conclusion of that Conference Lord Halifax expressed the yearnings of the people of 51 nations  vested in the United Nations Charter which they had created in order to bring a future of peace and security  co-operation and democracy:""Let us pray  keeping equally in mind the needs of the world and our own weakness  that what we have done  assisted by the hand of God  here in the past few weeks will be worthy of the faith that gave rise to it and the human suffering at the cost of which it was achieved.""In this general debate most of the eminent speakers have quite rightly agreed that the President at this session of the General Assembly bears an enormous responsibility. The challenge faced by the United Nations at this time is matched only by the responsibility assumed by the founders of the Organization four decades ago. We are fortunate that an experienced diplomat has been elected President of this Assembly. We are certain that he is fully familiar with every aspect of the work of this Organization  because of his years of outstanding service and his personal dedication to the cause of peace  and his election as President of the Assembly is also a tribute to Spain. That noble and admirable country gave birth to us and nourished us  and is permanently committed to the lofty purposes and principles of the Charter.The phenomenon of the world Organization has become possible only in the twentieth century. The old world empires were only an expression of expanded sovereignties. Before this century the world had a very weak political framework  based on a precarious balance of power. In our age  international relations are based rather on interaction between power and morality. Power expressed through the use of force in relations among States has been gradually curtailed by the new responsibilities imposed on the monopoly of power. Even the super-Powers have been obliged to adjust to the restrictions on the use of force imposed by considerations of their own survival. No State in our age can invoke the use of force in moral terms without previously availing itself of the means of negotiation and international law.We are still far from achieving the Plan for Perpetual Peace of the Vicar of St. Peter  or from governing the international community on the basis of the principle of magnanimity advocated by Burke; but it is equally true that today's world is far removed from the realities confronted by our forefathers  the builders of a past which still has its repercussions on the historical development of peoples and States.The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the united Nations invites us to ponder dispassionately on the most appropriate way of meeting the challenge of today's world. International relations have become universalized with the dizzying increase in the membership of the international community. The list of the protagonists on the world stage has grown more diverse  thus complicating the development of this Organization and the attainment of its purposes: international peace and security.Today's world is one in which interchanges of all kinds between nations have been intensified and multiplied  a phenomenon that runs counter to the fragmentation of the world into numerous sovereignties  national and absolute. These interchanges are at once a reason for the integration of the most dissimilar societies and a source of previously unknown conflicts  which are none the less always risky and dangerous.But we cannot act today without taking into account the fact that international issues are no longer the preserve of an elite of initiates. There is a genuine international debate in which the citizens of democratic countries take an active part in the formulation of national foreign policy and  what is more  in the pattern of continuing relations between third States. The impressive development of communications and the resulting realization that many subjects in international affairs affect the life of ordinary citizens has led to anunaccustomed publicity being given to diplomacy which still cannot replace the efficacy of methods of private negotiation in order to reach working compromises.He are now experiencing a world which has left behind the old systems of colonial and imperialist domination  a world which is caught between nationalism and the constant human need for political freedom. The struggle for national independence cannot make liberty irrelevant. None the less  the United Nations  which has contributed so greatly to the process of decolonization  which started at the end of the Second World War  notes the increasing frequency of the imprisonment of man by the State.Now we are living in a world in which the concept of war equates with total annihilation. The development of thermonuclear weapons and the strategy of deterrence have left the destiny of mankind hanging by a thread. This is a sword of Damocles  which may deliver a mortal blow to the whole of mankind and plunge us into chaos.Today we see a world in which tensions have shifted away from the old centers of power towards new zones of instability located outside the territories of the major Powers and concentrated in developing countries  in which the various ideologies and sources of hegemony pursue their own interests.Today we third-world nations cannot be indifferent to the imperative need for understanding among the strongest in order to prevent  as Bertrand Russell said  open confrontation and the oppression of the weak nations.Now more than ever are we duty-bound to close the gap between wealthy and poor nations. In this century  which is now drawing to a close  we have experienced a period in which the fundamental idea of economic and social progress has been focused on the construction of increasingly egalitarian national societies. The challenge of the future is this: Will we be able to build a more just and more humane world society?Today's world tells us also that we have set up a genuine international system with a series of specialized agencies which are working to fulfill their responsibility to bring men closer together as brothers through co-operative efforts for common understanding and common well-being. This impressive network of agencies also leads us to inquire whether we have been capable of meeting with the urgency required the fundamental needs to which they are addressed: hunger  illness and ignorance  which afflict to an equal  extent millions of persons languishing in despair and anguish in ""a world divided for all"".The States Members of the United Nations are confronting this reality  which is  at the same time  what we have done and what we have failed to do to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to promote fundamental human rights  to maintain justice and respect for international obligations and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.The United Nations as an Organization cannot be merely a debating society in which the sufferings of our peoples and the sorrow of mankind is described. As well as being a forum for exchanging views  the United Nations must increasingly be a meeting-place for finding collective solutions to the problems facing this age of unknowns and expectations.There is also a growing requirement for the United Nations to be known more for its achievements than for its failures in the effective maintenance of international peace and security. This requires that Member States should strengthen their political role and their means of action in order resolutely to confront the dangers that lie in wait for us.There is a need for the United Nations to have the ability to change with time and in time. Perhaps this capacity for accommodation and flexibility has enabled it to survive moments of immense confusion and turmoil. But essentially it is necessary that the United Nations should cease to be peripheral to the vital interests of the Member States  particularly the super-Powers. It must assume shared responsibility based on a pattern of national policies which will not interfere with the fundamental objectives of the United Nations  policies which will not challenge its authority but which will  on the contrary  strengthen its prestige.The ""first and most important step towards peace is to desire peace sincerely""; and this sincere desire does not allow for reserving spheres of competence  which would be detrimental to the dynamic and effective activity of the United Nations in building peace on the solid basis of collective interest rather than of isolated and exclusive interests.We should not be top confident that the worst will not in fact come to pass. At die present time there are political  strategic and security conditions which are so dangerous that they constitute in themselves an appeal to common sense and compromise. There are economic and social conditions which  like open wounds  are clamoring not just for compassion but also for justice and equity. Let us not commit the error of relying unduly on our development and underestimating our weakness. We should never have to repeat the words of Sir Charles Webster  who said  deploring the situation which gave rise to the second world conflagration:""There were so many enmeshed links between nations that some  with excessive enthusiasm  felt they were sufficient to check the forces that were capable of leading to war. None the less  when they were put to the test those intermeshed links turned out to be no stronger than a spider's web across the mouth of a cannon.""The United Nations is today facing a whole range of problems that will have a great bearing on our future. We note with justifiable concern that little or nothing has been done by us towards disarmament  the reduction of the arsenals of war. The principle enunciated at the Hague Peace Conference in 1899 remains valid. It is that""it is highly desirable for the improvement of the material and moral well-being of mankind that there should be a restriction of military expenditures  which at the present time constitute a heavy burden on the world"".We are today confronted with the same problems as yesterday  without having committed ourselves to freeing mankind from the sinister specter of the balance of terror  death and destruction.Lowes Dickinson explained this  showing a striking grasp of the facts  when hesaid:""As long as the States of the world go on arming themselves with a view to war  as long as they continue to follow policies which can be carried out only by means of war and as long as they enter into alliances with the expectation of war and conduct their relations in secret because of war  there will continue to be war  until that war puts an end to mankind; and throughoutall that time anything alleged to be a reason for the continued existence of the State - the prosperity of the people  the quest for knowledge  the practice of art and religion - will be sacrificed to Moloch  which in turn will offer nothing back except the expectation of sacrificing it all yet again.""We may well wonder whether the twenty-first century will find us without an institutional system that will truly get rid of the use of force as a means of resolving conflicts between States  without a system for the prevention of conflicts  without a collective system capable of suppressing acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace. It is truly a source of concern that the international legal order  notwithstanding the noteworthy progress made in the development of its codification  might in fact fail  even in certain specific areas to become a common law of mankind applicable on a mandatory basis as the only way of exorcising the bellicose spirit. A common law of mankind which would give practical expression to the maxim of Thomas More that ""nothing is less glorious than glory won by war"".With that in mind  we must work hard to banish the use of force as a means of settling disputes between States. As long as the system of the peaceful settlement of disputes is applied universally  to that extent also we shall be serving the essential purpose of the united Nations  which is the maintenance of international peace and security. As fat as the mechanisms of peace are concerned  the task facing us is such a pressing one that we must make greater progress than has been made in the machinery for extermination through war.Within the broad and fundamental chapter in the history of peoples concerned with human rights  it has been one of the primary purposes of the United Nations to promote respect for the dignity of man. None the less  the world witnesses with indignation and horror continuing disregard of and contempt for human rights  which has given rise and continues to give rise to acts of barbarity which are an outrage to the conscience of mankind. This is all the more important in that it has been universally recognized that the highest expression of man and the advent of a world in which human beings  freed from fear and poverty  enjoy freedom will derive from those rights.He are also deeply convinced that  through world and regional institutions  one of the primary obligations of the community of nations is to protect those rights and condemn those who  inexcusably  violate them and trample them under foot.The concept of human rights has spread from the original individual and public rights to rights in the economic  social and cultural spheres which should be enjoyed by all men and worsen. Such a concept indicates that we should also strengthen our struggle against discriminatory practices which  unfortunately  still prevail against certain human groups and minorities.By virtue of their very universal essence  human rights cannot be the privilege of one country or group of countries or to any system of government. Human rights  in addition to being a collective obligation  constitute an ethical obligation that must be fulfilled in each and every one of our societies.He shall discover that the true essence and nobility of democracy lies precisely in respect for and the promotion of human rights  and in those States where the systematic violation of those rights tarnishes our primordial commitment to the Creator we shall find the most cruel expression of offensive and degrading absolutism.Perhaps the greatest challenge facing the United Nations is that of meeting the most pressing demand of our time - the demand for international justice. The United Nations has devoted much of its efforts and resources to this task  through its specialized agencies  in areas such as food  population  trade  education  refugees  children  industrialization  technology  development finance and monetary questions. This titanic task requires a new political impetus. There is an urgent need for motivation  which will be derived from the feeling of humanity and the need for the survival of the international community  for without any doubt international injustice is the greatest threat to international peace and security.Nearly 900 million human beings are in a situation of extreme poverty. There are so many needs that we must establish a system of priorities and it will be necessary to review the categories of countries which should receive international assistance in accordance with the particular features of their economic and social situation. In order to be successful it is essential to incorporate in this task of salvation the efforts of the populations of the countries themselves.In this regard  the United Nations should establish an international development strategy that would give concrete expression to assistance in well-structured programs based on proper priorities. We need precise plans and goals  the achievement of which necessitates also a commitment on the part of the most privileged countries to contribute a sufficient quantity of material and human resources.The United Nations should give proof of the political will of its Members and the ability to innovate and show imagination.We cannot continue to allow millions of human beings to die of hunger from inanition  nor can we continue to tolerate the present high rates of infant mortality when measures such as universal immunization  proposed by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  can effectively reduce them before long.We cannot continue to allow arms expenditures to grow in inverse ratio to the decline in international development aid.We cannot continue allowing the absurdity of having the poorer countries being major capital exporters despite their heavy burdens resulting from the overwhelming weight of servicing foreign debt  given the onerous conditions in which financing has taken place.We cannot continue to allow the massive efforts to develop production in the third world to be frustrated by restrictions imposed by international trade designed to protect the most advanced economies.We cannot go on tolerating a situation in which  through an imbalance in the terms of trade  our countries continue to transfer wealth to the richer countries  thus widening the enormous gulf that already separates them from us.We cannot continue to allow delays in the necessary reforms in the international monetary system that should permit greater participation by the developing countries in decision-making that directly affects them  a participation that should become particularly evident in the processes of adjustment of their economies but which will not mean greater social sacrifices that might destabilize their political and economic systems.The United Nations has an agenda that is crucial for the years ahead. The report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues put it as follows:""At the beginning of a new decade  just 20 years from the millennium  we must rise above disputes and routine negotiations and face the problems that threaten us over the long term. We live in a world where poverty and hunger continue in vast regions on earth  in which weapons are manufactured and sold as never before  and in which the destructive capacity to blow our world to smithereens has been built up.""What can now be seen on the agenda is the reordering of international relations  the establishment of a new order and a broad approach to development problems. A similar process of reconstruction and renewal should be guided by the principle of equality of rights and opportunities. It should seek just settlements in order to put an end to grave injustices. It must put an end to pointless disputes and promote the common well-being of nations. Experience shows that there will be a need for great determination and firmness of purpose in order to achieve structural changes that will be just and of mutual benefit.""We must not leave out of account in our thoughts the machinery necessary to keep the peace. We see that the United Nations has to cope with problems of efficiency and means for action essential for it to do its job.In this connection I wish to draw the attention of delegations to the problems arising from the lack of implementation of the provisions for collective security provided for in the Charter  the lack of a harmonious relationship between the principal political bodies of the United Nations  the use of those bodies as spheres for confrontation and rostrums for propaganda  and the importance of guaranteeing the political independence and initiative of the Secretary-General in pursuit of the purposes and principles of the Organization.We also cannot fail to refer to the need for greater  more effective co-ordination among the organs  bodies and institutions of this international entity and the urgent need to establish priorities to solve the basic problems and to discuss subjects of fundamental importance.The United Nations now faces a challenge of knowing whether man will prove able to perfect a system to govern himself and to exercise the right to self-determination inherent in the purposes of the United Nations.The main issues on which the United Nations capacity to fulfill the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter are being challenged today have been demonstrated by a series of peripheral conflicts which are detrimental to international stability and the security of States.These conflicts  most of which are local in nature  have been before the Organization for many years and in some cases for decades. The fact that pending conflicts remain unresolved is also a new test for the world system of peace and security.Suffice it for me to refer to a few striking and disturbing examples cause us some concern: the case of the bloody struggle going on for the independence of Namibia; the foreign occupation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan; the bloody war between Iraq and Iran; the prolonged absence of South Korea from this Organization  a fact that strikes at the principle of the universality of the united Nations; the violence that is shaking the Middle East; the uncertainty as to the future of Cyprus; the crisis afflicting the Central American region; the conflict of the Malvinas  and the odious policy of racial discrimination in South Africa  which is an illustration of the dominance of the force of might over the force of law.Honduras  my country  belongs to a part of the world that in the last few years has been subjected to the distressing harassment characteristic of international relations.In Central America it would seem that the ideological hegemonies have turned a deaf ear to the cry of despair of the poor and oppressed which are so moving as to strike a responsive chord in the heart of Central American man.In this region of the Western Hemisphere a struggle is going on that is sometimes very much out in the open  and other times less so  aimed at imposingdesigns contrary to the dignity of the human being in order to give free rein to a totalitarianism that is incompatible with our peoples' desire to redress injustice.The constant effort to secure freedom as an instrument for a better destiny for man; the unrelenting desire for justice as a principle that gives each one what is his due; the struggle for democracy as a pluralistic expression in the political and economic sphere; and the dedication to the cause of peace as constituting a state of understanding and not an artificial truce  all find in Central America a fertile seed-bed in which to germinate in the furrows of human activity; but this is a land abandoned because ""it has been waiting in vain for the gardener"". Those at the level of world-wide confrontations must not forget that man is part of society and that society is part of the State  and must respond to Christian and spiritual values so that all human beings may coexist on a basis of co-operation and solidarity.In this tumultuous region in which we live - and live together - attempts are being made to supplant our aspirations for a better future. This is the region which has so long been under discussion by the Contadora Group  which seeks to replace our collective plight by dedication to peace and democracy  to justice and security  so that men can work together as brothers and flourish.If we fail to understand this situation  which speaks for itself like a cry of protest at an unhinged world  we shall be failing to interpret properly a fundamental aspect of the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  drafted in this Organization  which warns us that human rights should be protected by the rule of law  so that men should not be compelled to have recourse  as a last resort  to rebellion against tyranny and oppression.Natural and political tragedies  in violent and destructive form  have struck the destiny of our peoples. The earthquake which caused such damage in Mexico has greatly saddened us. The international community has expressed its solidarity with this Latin American nation  where the republican voice of Benito Juarez was once heard saying that among men as among nations  peace lies in respecting the rights of others. The kidnapping of the daughter of the President of El Salvador is a barbarous act which deserves to be strongly condemned by all countries which seek  through dialog and democracy  systems of civilized and pluralistic coexistence.There are other actions which downgrade the noble aspirations of man on this continent. The breach of values of the human being looms like a specter roaming the dark alleys of absolutism  while violations of the attributes of the sovereignty of the people strike at the very essence of our collective desires at a time when we should all be concentrating on our internal obligations and international commitments.When submitting the fifth annual report on the work of the United Nationson 12 July 1950  barely five years after the foundation of the Organization  the then Secretary-General  Trygve Lie  said:""At the time that this report is written it is not possible to be confident about the future of the United Nations and the prospects of world peace. But it is equally impossible to be hopeless. There is too much support among the peoples of the world for the United Nations and too much constructive work being carried out under United Nations auspices to permit any of those who bear the burdens of authority in the Governments of Members or in the Secretariat of the United Nations to relax for an instant in the determination to do everything possible to save the united Nations as a universal Organization standing firmly against war and to make it a stronger instrument for peace and progress.""If the United Nations is able to emerge intact and successful from the present crisis  its strength and influence will be immeasurably enhanced  and the world will be much closer to lasting peace than at any time since 1945."" (A/1287  Introduction  p. XIV)In the four decades that have passed since its founding  the United Nations has represented in the history of mankind  an instrument available to all for the building of peace  as the supreme ideal of man and of nations. While in San Francisco we were able to meet the challenge of the post-war period  it is now our obligation to attack with equal strength and resolution our task of building a world of peace and freedom.It was for those ideals that General Francisco Morazan  who was born in Honduras 193 years ago today  fought and died. General Morazan  born on 3 October 1792  was shot on 15 September 1842 by the die hards of conservative reaction  just when the twenty-first anniversary of the political independence ofthat turbulent region was being celebrated. He is the most outstanding hero and. martyr of the unity of Central America  the creator and President of the Federation of the five States  -who spurned the lure of dictatorship in order to establish a democratic government and who engraved in the bronze of history the visionary warning that freedom must recover its rules in the world."
"54",3054,"HTI",40,1985,"I wish  on behalf of the delegation of Haiti  to convey to Mr. Jaime de Pinies our heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. His vast experience in international relations  his talents as a skilled diplomat and the objectivity which characterizes his statements augur well for his important task. We are pleased to see this honor brought upon the great Spanish nation  with which the Republic of Haiti has had excellent ties which have their origin in the meeting of civilizations in the Caribbean.I wish also to express our gratitude to Ambassador Lusaka.of Zambia for the mastery and skill which he showed in guiding the proceedings of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.May I also pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless devotion to the cause of our Organization  aimed at strengthening its role and thus contributing to international peace and co-operation.Once again I express to the Government and people of Mexico our deepest sorrow over the disaster which recently struck that friendly country. I assure them of our total solidarity at this difficult time  which they are facing with courage and exemplary resolve.At a time when we are about to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  it seems essential to me to take a hard look at the work done since 1945  to look back and assess the action taken during this period  in order to reach conclusions which will allow us to correct our path and to come closer to the solemn objectives embodied in our Charter.Obviously the results of these four decades appear differently  and global results can be assessed differently  according to the ideological world one belongs to  or according to the degree of wealth or power one may have  according to the deep ambitions and real motivations one has. However  one thing remains certain: despite aborted meetings  unresolved crises  unavoided tragedies and challenges which are increasing in number  the United Nations has proved its capacity for survival throughout a tumultuous era characterized by political  economic  social and technological upheavals without precedent in the history of mankind.Throughout these 40 years  the United Nations has in fact been at the center of the greatest network of exchange which has ever existed at the heart of the most complex set of legal international rules  and has become through its organs and specialized agencies a unique instrument  universal in scope  serving the most noble dreams and ambitions of the world community.He cannot underestimate the major role played by our Organization in the process of decolonization  in the development of solutions and compromises that have limited certain conflicts  in the study and realization of economic and technical assistance programs  and in the defense of the essential freedoms and fundamental rights of the human person.We can also point to the many activities concerned with the welfare of children and refugees  and the efforts made to increase public awareness about the problems of development  disarmament and all forms of discrimination.Nevertheless  despite these encouraging achievements  we must admit that for us in the small third-world countries  desperately struggling to improve the living conditions of our populations  despite the inadequate resources available  the promises made have not been fulfilled  and our most legitimate aspirations have not been satisfied.The Republic of Haiti was present at San Francisco and sincerely believed that in the wake of the catastrophic upheaval of the Second World War the will  the wisdom and the generosity of men devoted to peace and justice would lead to a new era based on full respect for the principles embodied in our Charter. It believed that a new order would be established  based essentially on the equality and sovereignty of Member countries  on »-.he rights of peoples to self-determination  on the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.Above all it believed that our Organization  in keeping with vocation  would be at the center of an enormous movement of active solidarity that would bring about real transfers of resources from the richest to the poorest  from the North to the South  in a climate of understanding and mutual respect and in the light of an intelligent vision of long-term interests of the international community.The Republic of Haiti  therefore  believed that science and technology would be used in the service of mankind  instead of contributing to its destruction  in order to put a final end to the specters of hunger  ignorance and disease  to provide the Members of our Organization  especially the poorest ones  with the means to secure living conditions commensurate with their dignity.Was this too much to hope for? Did that attitude show a lack of understanding of the facts of international life which 181 years of hard-won independence  preserved by endless sacrifices  should have kept constantly in the minds of our people? in fact we believed that there would be a steady elimination of the scourges of racism  segregation and foreign domination  from which we were made to suffer so much for having dared to defy the colonial Powers  at a time when freedom was enjoyed only by the privileged few on our planet. But we did hold such a belief  and such a hope  and were disappointed. For how can we disregard the increasing difference between the purposes and principles of our Organization on the one hand and the disturbing deterioration of the international situation on the other? How can we pass over in silence the increase in tension  the persistence of hotbeds of crisis  and the continuing widening of the gap separating the poor countries from the industrialized nations  a gap which reveals the tragic blockage of the development strategies which the United Nations undertook to promote?This alarming situation obviously is a major challenge which must be met as soon as possible if we do not wish to see the crisis of confidence resulting from such continuing frustration lead to the progressive paralysis of our institutions  of which there is already some warning signs.For us there is no doubt that this regrettable state of affairs essentially stems from the disappointing attitude of certain Member countries  in particular  the most powerful ones  whose tendency to subordinate the implementation of the provisions of the Charter to their national interests has all too often rendered the United Nations incapable of acting to resolve disputes and promote international co-operation. We hope for a general resurgence of the political will  that is essential for a better observance of the principles of our Organization  because  since wherever we look  on any continent  we must feel deeply concerned at the grave threats to peace and to the economic and social development of third-world nations Thus  today once more a crisis whose gravity is plain to all grips southern Africa  where the right of peoples to self-determination has never been so tragically violated. The savage and indiscriminate killings perpetrated everyday throughout this year must be added to the long list  of victims who  since the Sharpeville massacre  have paid with their lives in demonstrating their complete and irrevocable refusal to accept the system of apartheid. These events compel the international community to turn its attention to an unjustifiable situation which represents not only the most flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights  but also a constant challenge to our Organization  which since 1946  has not been able to dismantle this obsolete remains of colonialism and racism.The Republic of Haiti  which was the first one  let us remember  to inform the League of Nations of the scandal of the massacre of the Hottentots in South west Africa  and to take up the question of South Africa's racial policy  believes today more than ever that the delaying tactics designed to obstruct the definitive elimination of the system of apartheid must be condemned  in speaking once again against the so-called internal reforms  which are nothing more than an attempt to perpetuate the system  Haiti is compelled to denounce the ill-concealed collusion on the part of all those countries which  under the highly questionable pretext of the preservation of their strategic interests  fail to end all co-operation with Pretoria in the political  military  economic and nuclear fields. The time has come for a consensus to be formed not on illusory partial measures  but on the urgent need to adopt comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist minority in South Africa; that action  in conjunction with increased assistance to the liberation movement  represent the only way to break its brutal arrogance and permit the emergence of a just and democratic society based on equal rights and duties for all citizens.The Government of Haiti is encouraged by the decisions taken recently by certain Western countries to increase pressures on the South African regime which represents undeniable progress as compared with previous positions. But it believes that these measures are still largely insufficient and that we must go all the way until total victory  regardless of the distracted and incoherent declarations of the Pretoria leaders.Haiti welcomes the praiseworthy efforts of the Special Committee Against Apartheid and reaffirms its solidarity and its unswerving support for the resolute struggle of the people of South Africa.Similarly  the Government of Haiti strongly opposes the illegal occupation of Namibia by the Pretoria regime in flagrant violation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  and its refusal to co-operate in implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which laid down the bases for a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the Namibian question. Haiti unreservedly condemns the brutal repression of the Namibian people  the shameless plunder of its natural resources  and the maneuver designed to destroy its national unity and territorial integrity. It reaffirms its unflagging support of and unconditional commitment to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the only authentic and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  in its heroic struggle to free itself from a century of colonial and racial oppression.The Republic of Haiti continues categorically to reject any attempt to link the independence of Namibia to geo-political considerations and to the solution of questions involving the sovereignty of other States. It supports the authentic independence of Namibia on the basis of resolution 435 (1978) and calls upon the Security Council to meet its responsibilities by adopting the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.It formally appeals to the international community to sake every effort to enable the Namibian people to exercise Cully its sovereignty over all of its territory and to regain its inalienable rights to freedom  dignity and happiness.In the Middle Bast  which continues to be an area subjected to an uninterrupted cycle of violence  where blind terrorism increases uncertainty every day  it has never been more obvious that the solution to the crisis is to be found in the establishment of comprehensive peace in the region based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).The Government of Haiti  which follows very closely recent initiatives aimed at promoting dialog among all the parties directly concerned  hopes that the latter will seize the opportunity to contribute to a just  peaceful and lasting solution embodying  on the one hand  the right of Israel to exist and to security within recognized and guaranteed boundaries  and  on the other hand  the undeniable right of the Palestinian people freely to express its identity  to effective self-determination within a physical  legal and administrative framework consonant with its legitimate aspirations.In Asia  there are also focal points of conflict brought about and kept alive by the expansionist designs of certain States  clearly determined to impose their will upon others through an illegal military presence in flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. We must refer here to the tragedy in occupied Afghanistan and Cambodia. The Republic of Haiti warmly welcomes the patriotic struggle of the Khmer and Afghan peoples  and expresses its heartfelt thanks to the Secretary-General  his representatives  and all those who  in one capacity or another  work towards restoring peace and security in that long-suffering part of the world. It joins the international community in calling for the total immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the occupation troops thus permitting those states freely to choose the model of government they seem appropriate free from all forms of foreign pressures. With regard to the Korean peninsula the Republic of Haiti believes that its continued division is a source of instability and tension in the region.In that context* it welcomes continuation of the inter-Korean dialog which has just led to encouraging results such as the setting up of a Joint Committee of Economic Co-operation  the first inter-parliamentary meeting  and exchanges of family visits for the first time since the end of the war  as well as artistic exchanges.Haiti also supports the idea of the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations pending a final settlement of the reunification question. That would certainly help to reduce tension in the region and to bring the Organization closer to its ideal of universality.The Government of Haiti is particularly^ interested in the development of the crisis in Central America which  in recent years  had been marked by a regrettable escalation of violence  giving rise to legitimate concern among peace-loving States in the continent. It is clear to us that a focal point of tension has been created which could eventually extend  if we are not careful  beyond its present geographical limits. It should be pointed out  in this connection  that the dramatic situation there is caused by the many serious social and economic problems besetting the peoples of the region. They are the only ones capable of defining their wishes and deciding on their road to development.In that context the Government of Haiti  faithful to the principles which have always been at the root of its foreign policy  continues to support unreservedly the constructive action undertaken courageously by the Contadora Group  with a view to restoring  through dialog and consultation  peace and security in the region.We are pleased to note that patience and goodwill have led to the preparation of a set of concrete proposals which form the draft act of peace and co-operation in Central America  we hope that the final document will be adopted as quickly as possible  but also that the commitments subscribed to therein are observed  that the level of arms is effectively reduced and that the region may find peace once again based on restoration of a balance essential to coexistence.Within that framework  the Republic of Haiti is pleased to note the role played in that part of the world by the European Economic Community in providing active and disinterested support to the negotiations. Similarly  the establishment of a Central American development agency will constitute a positive contribution to the solution of the social and economic problems of the region.With regard to the south Atlantic  the Republic of Haiti  as it has repeatedly stated  considers the situation prevailing in the Malvinas Islands as the consequence of an anachronistic colonial order. It rejects any de facto situation created by force and appeals to the parties concerned to renew negotiations in order to arrive at a just and equitable solution  taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the Argentine nation.This year again  on the eve of the eagerly awaited encounter between the super-Powers  after having heard proposals and explanations by representatives of the Powers which have an arsenal capable of destroying humanity several times over  we formally renew our appeal for a halt to the arms race.We appeal to the nations responsible for a solution to this agonizing question  to pursue their promising dialog which we welcomed when it was initiated early this year  we urge them to avail themselves of every opportunity for consultation which may be offered them. What is at stake is too important. Occasions are few. The consequences are too serious  and the alternative is a costly  dangerous and ephemeral military supremacy.Once again the Republic of Haiti insists that a collective initiative be taken to enable the international development institutions to transfer a substantial portion of the funds made available through implementation of a program of general  progressive and balanced disarmament. We remain convinced that therein lies the best way to defuse tension and consolidate peace.The sombre international political picture should not make us forget the seriousness of the economic problems which developing countries face today. While it is true that the turmoil of recent years has somewhat subsided  the pace of development of third world nations has nevertheless not matched its level of the Sixties. For most of the African and Latin American nations real per capita income is no more than it was 10 years ago. Hence  the ability of the international system in its present form to find appropriate solutions for a difficult situation  which is disastrous to much of mankind  is being questioned.A particularly disquieting aspect of this drama is  no doubt  the persistence of the terrible famines on the African continent  which directly threaten 200 million people.Optimistic projections estimate that by 1990 there will be 900 million people living in absolute poverty. Need we point out that this is a scandalous attack on the dignity of the human person? It causes us to question the significance and effectiveness of international co-operation mechanisms  as well as the institutions acting in the name of the moral and intellectual solidarity of mankind. It is difficult to place the entire blame for this situation on the United Nations  which merely reflects the lack of political will among the wealthy countries to make the necessary major structural changes.However  after due analysis  we must stress the following points. First of all  the response given by the international community so far on the problems of underdevelopment has not been sufficient considering the scope of the means of the third world. Indeed  in all the crucial areas  the transfer of resources to the poor nations has been dramatically insufficient. Thus the precarious situation of the 1970s led  after the recent period of international recession  to a spectacular increase in the North-South economic gap  as shown in the persistent worsening of the terms of trade  the drastic fall of export receipts in some cases  and the tensions brought about by the third world's foreign debt  which is 40 per cent of its gross national product  with 36 per cent short-term commercial \ot> >s. The level of indebtedness has exceeded $800 billion and it will continue to be an element of instability in the international system unless appropriate measures are carried out to take into account the effective reimbursement capacity of the countries concerned and the need to guarantee their investment programs.The debt problem has become a priority issue for all developing nations. We must stress its serious social and political consequences  as history has taught us that the transfer of international capital in the form of loans or direct investments has throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries played an important role in the development of many countries  particularly countries that are now industrialized nations; it has also shown that in every crisis period only measures taken by creditors and debtors together have enabled the world financial system to regain its balance.In the last analysis  the final solution is to promote growth  with suitable transfers of resources of all kinds. Unfortunately  the rate of investment has slowed down considerably  and the objective of 7 per cent growth envisaged for the Third United Nations Development Decade remains illusory. The commitmentundertaken by the international community 10 years ago at the World Food Conference to eliminate the scourge of hunger by 1984 also remains a dead letter.Together with this there has been a regression as regards the achievement of the objectives of official development assistance  which by 1985 at the latest should have exceeded the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries. We have serious doubts about the fate of the Common Fund for Commodities and of the energy affiliate of the World Bank  and  indeed  of other global negotiations. How can one not condemn such regression? How can one admit that the last replenishment of funds of the international Development Association was arbitrarily limited to $9 billion instead of the $15 billion normally envisaged? Every year the arms race absorbs almost 50 times the total volume of assistance to the third-world countries  thus preventing them from dealing with their development problems.The recent economic crisis  far from bringing about the solidarity expected in the third world  has  on the contrary  given rise to selfish responses which could seriously endanger the development possibilities of the developing countries. We are especially concerned over the proliferation of restrictive measures and the intensification of protectionist pressure  which are contrary to international obligations and  being initiated by rich nations  could increasingly and seriously penalize the developing countries in vital sectors of their economies. The Government of Haiti has taken note with satisfaction of the determination with which the United States Administration has decided to combat increased protectionism and expresses the wish that other developed countries will adopt further provisions to contribute to the world's economic recovery through increased investments and liberalization of trade.Once again we must admit that the theoretical priority attached to the problems of the least developed countries has not by any meant resulted in sufficient efforts by the international community. The situation of the least developed countries five years after the launching of the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s gives rise to the most serious concern  because for the most part per capita income has fallen considerably and the average growth of national income has been 0.7 per cent during the first three years of the Program.The decisions taken by certain donor countries have not been able to alleviate the specific difficulties of the least developed countries. Essential action still remains to be taken to implement an effective program of sufficient scope to enable those countries to acquire the basic Infrastructures  which they now lack  finance their agricultural and industrial development  promote education and the technical training of their peoples  and reduce their excessive vulnerability to external fluctuations and to problems inherent in the structure of their internal production.The Republic of Haiti believes that the process of adjustment that we have undertaken must envisage as a priority the creation of new jobs  the establishment of new industries and the financing of new programs. Therefore external financing must be increased to make debt-servicing possible while maintaining investments and stimulating exports  because a world in which developing countries face simultaneously a fall in their standard of living and the draining away of their capital is by definition volatile.In conclusion  there is no doubt that the success or failure of the Substantial New program of Action will be the most revealing test of the will of the rich countries to restore credibility to the North-South dialog. If  for this small group of States with relatively modest needs  the international community is not now able to undertake the necessary reforms  one has the right to ask when and for whom it will be able to do so.Now more than ever before the third world must rely on its own forces close its ranks and systematically explore the many possibilities for South-South cooperation. For its pact  the Republic of Haiti faithful too its traditions  continues to face a particularly difficult situation but it is oak lug every effort to ensure the full mobilization of its internal resources in the service of the basic objectives ox its social and economic development and the promotion of the fundamental rights of the Haitians  in full accordance with the provisions of the Charter  the objectives of the regional institutions to which we belong and the multilateral conventions to which we have acceded.In that connection  our Government has in the course of this year  initiated one of the most important institutional reforms ever accomplished in the country  one of the main aspects of which has been the successful establishment of the legal and constitutional framework needed for developing genuine Haitian democracy.This new ""social contract""  based on rigorous norms of liberal and pluralistic democracy guarantees the exercise of fundamental freedoms  for the first time organizes the operation of political parties in Haiti  strengthens control by the legislative branch of government action  which will be carried out by a prime minister from the majority political group in Parliament after the coming legislative elections  envisaged for February 1987.Thus  under the leadership of President Jean-Claude Duvalier  Haitian democracy  in keeping with our basic socio-cultural personality  moves irreversibly towards the universal enjoyment of the political  social  economic and cultural rights of each citizen.Our objective is not to copy imported models that are difficult to apply  but rather to build a democratic society based on respect for law and deriving inspiration from our history and our culture which favors all forms of expression and encourages the effective participation of everyone in the decisions affecting our national destiny.But such a plan  such an aspiration  cannot be fully realized except in a climate of peace and stability  social progress and economic growth. Hence the Republic of Haiti  like all other third-world countries engaged in the bitter struggle for development but also interested in defending justice and freedom  must in the next few years have the unreserved support of the international community  of which the United Nations must remain the irreplaceable Center for reflection  decision  execution and co-ordination.The Government of Haiti wishes to renew its confidence in the future of our Organization. It firmly believes that errors can be corrected  gaps filled  resources increased  trust strengthened. It is convinced that we can improve on the application of the principles of our Charter and it stands ready to co-operate actively with all initiatives to that end. we continue to maintain that before the end of the century we can reach certain goals  such as the elimination of hunger and illiteracy which  because of their universal importance  transcend any ideological debate or political contingency. We have the means to do so. why not express our will to do so today?"
"55",3100,"HUN",40,1985,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its fortieth session. In wishing you every success in your honored and responsible post  I should like to assure you of the Hungarian delegation's active co-operation in the performance of your duties.May I take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Lusaka of Zambia  for his highly competent guidance of our work at the preceding session of the General Assembly.In the year 1985 several anniversaries of historic significance are taking place. The world-wide celebrations over the past months have recalled the fact that the years of the Second World War witnessed the forging of broad international co-operation in the struggle for the defense of human civilization and democratic ideas against the common enemy  fascism. The victory of the anti-Fascist coalition is good testimony to the possibility of rising above the differences in ideologies and political endeavors among those fighting for common goals. It was in that spirit that 40 years ago the United Nations was born to promote the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security.The terrible trials of the Second World War will always be present in the mind of mankind. Everyone of common sense will  however  realize that the appalling devastation of that war would pale by comparison to the horrors that a world conflagration in our age  a nuclear exchange  would bring upon the peoples  threatening the inhabitants of our globe with total annihilation. The most important lesson to be drawn from the events of four decades ago is still valid: co-operation between  and joint action by  countries with different social systems is not only necessary but also possible when mankind is in peril. In the world of today  fraught as it is with grave dangers  the common goal must be to avert a thermonuclear catastrophe and  to that end  to conduct a dialog between States  settling controversial issues by way of negotiations and developing co-operation based on mutual interests.We are convinced that the cause of the development of Soviet-American relations has a determinant role in maintaining peace in the world. We feel that this year has in addition to long-standing serious problems also seen certain developments that may give cause for hope. The summit meeting of the leaders of the Soviet Onion and the United States scheduled to take place soon may contribute to the improvement of relations between the two countries and to the relaxation of international tension. We  for our part  welcome that meeting  just as we do the Soviet-American talks at Geneva  where it is possible and also necessary to make progress in the limitation of strategic weapons  keeping in mind - in accordance with the agreement of the parties - the close relationship between space weapons and strategic and medium-range nuclear weapons. We think this calls for substantive measures to prevent the militarization of outer space.We support the efforts of the Soviet Union to reach agreement and welcome its highly important moves such as the unilateral suspension of the deployment of medium-range missiles and the halting of counter-measures  as well as the moratorium on nuclear explosions for a definite period. Those moves serve to create the more favorable atmosphere necessary for an agreement.We think that international security would be greatly enhanced by a similar response by the United States on the Soviet initiatives. Many opportunities have already been missed for building mutual confidence and for meaningful progress in solving pressing problems; this new opportunity should not be allowed to slip away.The Hungarian People's Republic considers that the fundamental goal of its foreign policy is to create favorable international conditions for peaceful national construction. Guided by this spirit  we feel duty-bound to make a contribution  commensurate with our means  to strengthening international security and promoting co-operation in good faith between States.As a member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization  Hungary takes an active part in the elaboration of proposals seeking to lessen international tension  curb the arms race and reduce the level of military confrontation. We attach particular importance to those endeavors because we believe that the process of detente cannot become definitively irreversible unless it is extended to the military field. The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty based themselves on that premise in their appeal addressed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries in May 1984 in which they proposed the conclusion of a treaty on the mutual renunciation of the use of armed force and on the maintenance of peaceful relations.With a view to safeguarding peace and further guaranteeing the security of their respective countries  the Warsaw Treaty States prolonged the validity of the Treaty last April. On that occasion we reaffirmed that we upheld our proposal concerning the simultaneous dismantling of the two military-political alliances  the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO  and that we were ready to start substantive negotiations on the subject. We also clearly expressed the intention of our alliance to launch initiatives on removing the danger of a nuclear catastrophe and preserving detente. An early constructive response by the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance to our initiatives would have a beneficial effect.In our international endeavors we  as a European nation  devote special attention to questions relating to peace on the continent and co-operation between its countries. The meeting of Foreign Ministers held in Helsinki to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was another manifestation of the significance of the all-European process and its relevance in international politics.We maintain that the most effective way of protecting the results of detente and strengthening European co-operation lies in the balanced implementation by all the participating States of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. The activities carried out by my Government in the spirit of Helsinki during the past 10 years and the development of its relations with all participating States are proof that small countries like Hungary can make a useful contribution to efforts to maintain peace and strengthen security and confidence.We consider the Stockholm Conference to be an important forum which may have a major role to play in strengthening confidence between States and lowering the level of danger of military confrontation in Europe. We believe that agreement in that forum is possible even in the current complex international situation. In order to achieve it  all participating States must make further significant efforts and summon up the necessary political will.Cultural co-operation  which creates a link between peoples and countries  occupies an important place in the process of European security and co-operation. We consider it a privilege to host in Budapest the European Cultural Forum scheduled to begin this month. The Forum will be discussing questions of creative activity  the dissemination of cultural values and cultural co-operation. For ourpart  we shall make every effort to see that the Forum contributes to strengthening the Helsinki process and improving the general political atmosphere.During its four decades of activity our world Organization has devoted great attention to timely disarmament issues  elaborated numerous positions of fundamental importance and adopted resolutions to implement them.But  despite disarmament efforts made in the United Nations and in other forums  the arms race continues  and with increasing intensity. Following the development of new generations of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  the extension of the arms race to outer space emerges as a real danger. We are convinced that there is a real chance  even in the current situation  to curb the arms race and bring about a radical change in the course of events. A reliable path towards the achievement of that goal is the establishment of relations between countries with different social systems on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and the elaboration and adoption of agreements based on the principles of equality and equal security  with a view to stopping the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race  and to avert the threat of a thermonuclear war.We welcome and support the highly important proposals submitted by the Soviet Union to the General Assembly at its present session concerning the development of broad international co-operation in preventing the militarization of outer space and promoting its peaceful  non-military uses.The organization called International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War held its fifth Congress in Budapest last summer. The basic theme of the Congress  which was attended by delegates from nearly all parts of the world  was to stress that co-operation  not confrontation  is imperative in a nuclear age. We fully agree with the assertion in the organization's appeal to the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States that ""indeed  there is now a new international consensus - that the only rational response to the threat of nuclear war is to work for its prevention"". The community of socialist countries  including the Hungarian People's Republic  has presented a whole range of concrete proposals in pursuit of that goal. In that context  we deem it of particular importance that every nuclear Power that has not yet done so undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Such a commitment could be instrumental in bringing about an international atmosphere that would offer a more realistic possibility of halting and reversing the nuclear-arms race.He think that  in addition to bilateral talks  the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  a multilateral forum established to elaborate disarmament accords  also has an essential role to play in this field. Concrete proposals for the elaboration of measures to prevent a nuclear war  as well as for the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  have long been on the table at that Conference. It is to be noted with regret that the negative tendencies generated by the attitude of extremist circles have in fact doomed that important disarmament forum to inaction and lack of success.In connection with nuclear disarmament  my Government attaches great significance to the Non-Proliferation Treaty  which it was among the first to sign and ratify. The experience of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held recently  has confirmed us in our belief that there is a possibility of preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons and the common will to do so. Progress in arms control and disarmament on the European continent  with its stockpiles of destructive weapons  would be of paramount significance for the whole world. We welcome any positive effort aimed at the removal of weapons from that continent.We support the proposal of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic for the creation of a zone free of chemical weapons in Europe a proposal which could make an effective contribution to the elimination of this particularly inhuman type of weapon.The past year has seen no improvement of the situation in local end regional hotbeds of crisis. Under the prevailing unfavorable international conditions  there are also no signs of actual progress in their settlement.With the continuing Israeli occupation of territories of several Arab countries  the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  the lack of any solution to the problem of Lebanon and the long-drawn-out Iraqi-Iranian war  the Middle East continues to be a most explosive regions of the world  one that is fraught with the gravest danger of conflict. That situation poses a threat not only to the peoples living in the region but also to the cause of universal peace. My Government deems it necessary therefore for both the countries of the region and the international forums  primarily the United Nations  to undertake the necessary efforts to find a negotiated solution to these conflicts.We favor a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis and the related question of Palestine that will ensure the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including the exercise of its right to establish a State of its own  as well as all the conditions and guarantees necessary for all States of the region to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders. For a comprehensive settlement of the problems in the region it is necessary to convene an international conference with the participation of all the parties concerned.The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic follows with great attention the developments in the Latin American continent and is sympathetic to the constructive efforts being made to solve the political and economic problems of the region. He regret that tension is being further exacerbated in Central America and in the Caribbean region  and actions threatening the sovereignty of Cuba and Nicaragua have multiplied and intensified over the past few years. My Government is increasingly concerned at such developments  which endanger the independence and the peaceful constructive efforts of the peoples of the region. It therefore lends its support to all efforts towards the solution of the problems by peaceful  political means  including  in the first place  the internationally commendable proposals made by the countries of the Contadora Group. It is appreciative of the participation of more Latin American countries in the guest for a negotiated solution to help eliminate tension.The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic continues to favor the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and respects its non-aligned status. It supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to secure a peaceful  negotiated settlement of the question of Cyprus in the spirit of the relevant United Nations resolutions with due regard for the interests of both ethnic communities.South-East Asia continues to be a sensitive spot in the international situation. We believe that the elimination of tension and the strengthening of security and stability in the region would serve the interests of all the peoples concerned and would have a favorable influence on the efforts being made to create a system of Asian security. With this end in view  we support any effort aimed at a political settlement of the confrontation which has emerged in that part of the world concerning  in particular  Kampuchea. Also we follow with sympathy the efforts of the countries of the region to establish a zone of peace  good-neighborliness and co-operation in South-East Asia.As regards the situation around Afghanistan  we maintain that what the people of Afghanistan needs more than anything else is peace for the continuation of its national construction program. We support the proposals for a settlement made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which take into account all the essential aspects of the problem. We welcome the activity of the special representative of the Secretary-General and are hopeful that the countries interested in a settlement will find a way to get down to direct negotiations.The resumption of the inter-Korean dialog is intended to promote a peaceful settlement  free from external interference  of the contradictory situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic sees promising prospects for further progress  and hopes that the constructive initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will meet with a positive response from the parties concerned.The policy of the regime in Pretoria  which enjoys the support of influential external forces  continues to pose a grave threat to the peace and security of the African continent. Under the prevailing system of apartheid the black population still lives in conditions of complete subjugation  deprived even of its most elementary human rights. The situation has been further aggravated by the state of emergency recently declared by the authorities. The foreign policy of the South African Government seeks to destabilize the neighboring countries and  to that end  it resorts to various political and economic measures  not even shrinking from armed intervention. Acting in open defiance of United Nations resolutions and appeals  it continues to prevent the Namibian people from gaining independence. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic most resolutely condemns the actions of the Pretoria regime and calls for concerted and effective international action against it  including coercive measures as provided for in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. It pledges support to and solidarity with the forces fighting against the system of apartheid and with the countries threatened by the racist regime  and demands an early implementation of the United Nations resolutions on Namibia.The economic situation is extremely grave in most countries of the African continent. The servicing of accumulated foreign debts absorbs a large part of the national income of those States  while the unparalleled drought in several countries threatens millions of people with starvation. My Government contributes  within its means  to alleviating the consequences of this tragic situation. At the same time  it shares the position of the Organization of African Unity that  in addition to the relief supplies that help to meet immediate needs  a lasting solution of the problems and the creation of conditions for economic progress on the continent call for joint efforts by the countries involved and require the implementation of long-term programs.It will be recalled that it was exactly 25 years ago that the General Assembly adopted the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which solemnly called for an early and unconditional elimination of all forms of colonialism. The practical implementation of the purposes and principles laid down in that document has brought about significant changes in this respect. We believe that broad international co-operation and resolute action are needed  on the part of the United Nations  too  in order to do away with the remaining vestiges of the colonial system. We support the just struggle of the national liberation movements and are in solidarity with the peoples fighting for the consolidation of their independence and against dictatorial and racist regimes.The Hungarian People's Republic lends support to the just aspirations of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. He practice fruitful co-operation and maintain friendly relations with many countries of the movement. He seek to continue strengthening those relations  and that endeavor is facilitated by the fact that our views are identical or similar on most issues of international politics. We are firmly convinced that the Non-Aligned Movement will remain an important and positive factor of international life in the future as well.These days the world economy is faced with worsening problems in the solution of which the United Nations and its specialized agencies have a significant role to play and a great responsibility to bear. It is our conviction that there is but me way leading to recovery  that of developing co-operation and creating the necessary conditions for it. The expansion and deepening of international co-operation requires recognition of and respect for the legitimate interests of all parties concerned. Several countries  including mine  are confronted with great difficulties as a result of the increasingly widespread policies of discrimination  embargo and protectionism. Their elimination from international practice would be greatly instrumental in coping with the problems of the world economy.The Hungarian People's Republic continues to favor the development of trade  economic  scientific and technical relations among States based on mutual benefit and free from discrimination.Joint efforts are similarly required in removing th<s disorders of the international monetary system  making rational use of raw materials  energy resources and food  and protecting the environment. We wish to be a good partner of States participating in the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and to make a contribution  within our means  to the solution of the pressing problems faced by the community of nations.It derives from the nature of our social system that we attach great importance to co-operation within the framework of the United Nations in promoting the fullest possible exercise of human rights. He regard it indispensable for the international community to take joint and effective action against the mass and gross violations of human rights. We  for our part  contribute our share to the implementation of human rights by developing our society  strengthening the substantive elements of socialist democracy and  in accordance with this? consistently fulfilling our international obligations.In referring to the difficulties and problems to be met by the international community  it has been my aim to underscore the urgent need for well-considered steps  broad international action  constructive approaches and forward-oriented deeds. We are convinced that mankind has the intellectual and material resources which  if mobilized  will enable it to meet the challenges of our age. However  finding successful and lasting solutions for the global questions and for other pressing problems affecting the future destiny of the world is conditional on exploiting the body of experience accumulated by mankind in the course of centuries  on making use of the almost unlimited potential created by the modern technology of our time for the attainment of those lofty goals and on putting an end to the inordinate squandering on an arms build-up of immense material and intellectual resources.In establishing international co-operation and co-ordinating joint actions  a major role is reserved for the United Nations  which is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of its foundation. The world Organization set forth in its Charter four decades ago the purposes of maintaining international peace and security  developing relations among nations and achieving international co-operation in solving economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems.It is a fact that since the United Nations was founded the world has witnessed deeply penetrating changes that have left their mark on our Organization as well. Nevertheless  we maintain that the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter are still valid today. Despite the significant results achieved during its 40 years of existence  the world Organization has not been able  nor has it been enabled by international realities and the divergent endeavors of Member States  to find solutions to all the problems that mankind has to face today. But this does not alter our conviction that the United Nations has an indispensable role to play in molding the shape of our future. We do believe that the community of nations  including our world Organization  can do a great deal ""for a better world""  as is also emphasized by the official theme of the United Nations Year. The fulfillment of this role would be greatly facilitated by enhancing the effectiveness of the work of the United Nations system.*The celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations are of particular relevance for Hungary  since it was 30 years ago that our country was admitted to membership in the world Organization. On that occasion  the Hungarian Government pledged that  in its foreign policy directed at safeguarding peace and promoting international co-operation in the spirit of the United Nations Charter  it would use its best efforts at the forums of the United Nations as well for maintaining and strengthening universal peace and security and ensuring peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems.During me past 30 years  the Hungarian People's Republic has pursued its foreign policy in accordance with that declaration  and it intends to conduct its future international activity in that same spirit. With its foreign policy course aimed at serving the universal cause of peace and progress  my country reaffirms its commitment to the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. This is evidenced by our efforts to improve the international atmosphere and carefully and purposefully to cultivate relations among peoples. I should like to confirm that it is the intention of the Hungarian Government to continue working in pursuit of those goals."
"56",3147,"IDN",40,1985,"It is a great pleasure for need to extend to Mr. Jaime de Pinies  on behalf of the delegation of Indonesia  my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fortieth session. His elevation to this high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and reflects the esteem in which Spain is held among the community of nations. The fact that he has served his country as a diplomat with great distinction and ability over the past four decades  three of them at the United Nations  eminently qualifies him to carry out his onerous duties with authority and efficiency.I also wish to express the gratitude and deep appreciation of ray delegation to his predecessor. Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia for the dignified and skillful manner in which which he guided the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  as well as for his chairmanship of the Preparatory Committee for the Fortieth Anniversary of the United Nations.The Assembly is greatly indebted to our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his dedicated leadership in guiding the work of the Organization. His incisive analyses and candid assessments of the impediments standing in the way of achieving the full potential of the United Nations  and the measures he has proposed to improve its performance  have provided us with a useful framework for our efforts to make the Organization assume its proper role in creating a better world.Before proceeding  I would like to express my delegation's heartfelt sorrow for the victims of the tragic earthquakes that have struck Mexico with such devastation. Our sympathy and feelings of solidarity go out to the Government and people of Mexico  in their hour of anguish and great hardship.We are all aware of the particular significance of this fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly  taking place as it does amidst the turbulence of sweeping changes and the emergence of historical trends in the world. Some of these changes are to be welcomed as opportunities for the advancement of world peace  justice and the well-being of mankind  while others pose new problems and challenges to our collective ingenuity and resolve.On this auspicious occasion  therefore  we shall have the opportunity both for deep reflection on the history of the past forty years and a collective reappraisal of how further to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization in its realization of the purposes and objectives enshrined in the Charter.The United Nations was founded in the aftermath of a world conflagration of such devastation and destruction as to cause the founding fathers to summon up the common determination ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Significantly  they had the clarity of vision to conceive on organization designed not only to prevent war but to seek the elimination of the seeds of war as well: by establishing the principles of sovereign equality  justice  self-determination and freedom; by instituting a system of collective security based on non-interference and abstention from the threat or use of forces and by developing an international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social progress of all peoples  through friendly relations and co-operation among nations.While still in its formative stage  the United Nations faced major challenges unforeseen by the Charter. The security provisions  premised on great Power unity and co-operation  were frustrated by the emergence of new antagonisms immediately after the war. Neither the division of the world into military and ideological blocs nor the fierce competition for spheres of influence were anticipated  and the Organization  instead of serving as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations""  became an arena for the contending forces of the cold war.Confronted by the darkening clouds of great-Power rivalry and a profoundly disturbing international situation  the leaders of the newly emergent States moved to consolidate their unity and solidarity in order to address the plethora of problems before the international community. Nurtured by their common colonial legacy and the shared experience of the struggle for independence  they met in Bandung in 1955  at the historic Asian-African Conference  to define together their concept of a just world order and the relationships that would flow from it.First and foremost was their genuine desire to promote the Charter objectives of eradicating colonialism  ensuring respect for fundamental human rights  eliminating racial discrimination  encouraging the peaceful settlement of disputes  halting the arms race and promoting economic development through international co-operation. Indeed  of the Ten Principles enunciated by the Conference  the very first reiterated respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter. And at the observance of the thirtieth anniversary of the Asian-African Conference that my Government had the honor to host in Bandung last April  the participants reaffirmed their conviction that ""the United Nations is the unique and indispensable forum for resolving the major world issues"".The Bandung Declaration found concrete expression in the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement  in Belgrade in 1961  where its founding members undertook to revise fundamentally the dangerous simplicities of the cold war. Their objective was and still is to free the world from the policies of force  bloc rivalry  domination  hegemony and exploitation. The Non-Aligned Movement has sought to achieve a peaceful progression towards a democratized  international system of peaceful co-existence and co-operation among nations and to strengthen the vital role of equitably conceived international institutions in the attainment of this objective.The positive contributions of the Non-Aligned Movement to the further growth and direction of the United Nations are a matter of record  especially so in accelerating the process of world-wide decolonization  a process in which our Organization has played a central role. Since the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the twenty-fifth anniversary of which we are also commemorating this year  there has been a profound transformation in the quantitative as well as qualitative nature and workings of the United Nations. As a result  at its fortieth anniversary  the Organization has come ever closer to its goal of true universality.The constraints of time inhibit me from elaborating on the other achievements and the multitude of other activities on the positive ledger of our Organization's record during the past four decades. They are to be found in the numerous programs and measures that are continuously being formulated and implemented by its various organs  specialized agencies and related institutions. They cover international co-operation in such diverse fields as economic and social development; monetary and trade arrangements; the codification of basic concepts of international law; the promotion of fundamental human rights; education and scientific development; the peaceful uses of outer space; the exploitation of the sect-bed and ocean floor; the safeguarding of the environment  and many more.Can we any longer envisage a world without the United Nations and its specialized agencies to provide assistance and relief to the many thousands of refugees  to the millions of undernourished children and mothers  to those afflicted by hunger  poverty  disease and illiteracy? Can we deny such landmarks as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the outer space Treaty  to name but a few?Of course  in all these activities and programs success has not always been forthcoming; but what has been achieved and what continues to be done indeed touch on the essential purposes for which the United Nations as our collective instrument was created: that of building peace  of working on the essential conditions for lasting peace with justice in the world.Even in the field of keeping the peace  the other basic function of the United Nations  which through the years has been the object of such scathing public criticism because of its real or perceived failures  the record is not as poor as is sometimes suggested. It is true that the United Nations has failed to halt and reverse the global arms race  which has assumed such dangerous and irrational proportions as to threaten the very survival of mankind. It cannot be denied that the United Nations has not been able to prevent the 130 or more armed conflicts which since its founding have erupted in various regions of the world. But  to the extent that blame for this state of affairs can at all be attributed to the Organization  the pertinent fact to remember is that the United Nations can do only what its component Members want it to do and can succeed only if its Members are committed to make it succeed. Thus in assessing its performance in the maintenance of international peace and security the inherent limitations of its role must be taken into account. It can then be seen that in several conflict situations between Member States the United Nations has actually succeeded in finding a peaceful settlement. In many more instances  where a comprehensive solution could not be found immediately  the United Nations has been able to restrict the scopeand intensity of conflict  by substituting dialog for armed hostilities and by providing an acceptable framework within which the search for a solution could proceed in a peaceful way. In this context  United Nations peace-keeping operations have proved to be an important  innovative instrument in conflict control and in preventing the escalation of disputes into larger conflagrations.While admittedly the collective security system has not been able to function as envisaged by the Charter  even this limited role of the United Nations  as a channel for constructive dialog between contending parties  is shown to have been of immense value. Hence  in looking back at both its successes and its failures and  more importantly  in looking towards the future  we should not indulge in either lamentation or self-congratulation but rather try to draw positive lessons from them.We should acknowledge that the challenges the United Nations has faced throughout these years and the advances it has made towards a world of greater peace  larger freedom and well-being for mankind make a compelling case for the further strengthening of multilateral co-operation. Such co-operation should be seen as the inescapable expression of the concept of shared responsibility inherent in the Charter  of the sense of human solidarity that lies at the heart of multilateralism. But neither should we fail to act with even greater purpose and determination to rectify the obvious inadequacies and shortcomings of our Organization in addressing the central issues of our time.The underlying causes of existing conflicts persist  and new conflicts continue to emerge. There has been a precipitous decline in mutual trust and confidence among States  accompanied by an alarming recourse to armed force in the settling of disputes. The marked increase in tensions between the great Powers has led to a heightened polarization and to the revival of power polities. The rule of law  essential for a stable international order  is all too often being flouted. The world economy is plagued by stagnation  inequity and dislocation - and all this is occurring against the background of the most perilous arms race the world has ever known.In the past 40 years the United Nations and the international community at large have faced no greater challenge than the growing risk of nuclear war  propelled by an ever-escalating armament race and the excessive accumulation and qualitative refinement of weapons of mass destruction. At present the nuclear arsenals in the possession of the two major Powers have reached such levels as to be wholly disproportionate to any possible national security requirement. Indeed  they have acquired the capability to obliterate all life on earth many times  over. Thus  while the nuclear-weapon States must assume primary responsibility for this state of affairs  the imperatives of disarmament and international security cannot be left to their exclusive concern  for what is at stake is the most fundamental right of humans and of nations  which is the right to their very survival and existence. It is a matter of deep concern to note  therefore  that  while disarmament negotiations under United Nations auspices have yet to yield meaningful results  those conducted outside it have equally remained stalemated. We regret that this can be the only possible characterization of the recently resumed Geneva negotiations between the two major Powers  whose avowed objective is the termination of the arms race on earth and its prevention in outer space.Meanwhile new technologies and new generations of weapon systems are continually being devised and deployed and new strategic doctrines formulated to rationalize their use. Consequently the threat of nuclear war has become more menacing than ever before. We continue to believe  therefore  that an immediate halt to all testing  production and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems  as a necessary first step  would greatly facilitate negotiations between the nuclear-weapon States. We also hope that the forthcoming summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will at least generate the necessary momentum to break the log-jam in all negotiating forums on disarmament.Indonesia has always supported the concept of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the context of a regionalist approach to disarmament. In South-East Asia the member States of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are at present engaged in working out principles and modalities in order to arrive at a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. As a Pacific-rim country  we welcome the recent establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. Likewise we support the stand taken by the South Pacific Forum countries against continued nuclear testing in the region.As a maritime nation and a non-nuclear-weapon State  Indonesia has viewed with mounting concern the proliferation and geographical dispersion of nuclear weapons on the world's oceans and seas. By resolution 38/188 G  of 20 December 1983  the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to carry out  with the assistance of a group of governmental experts  a comprehensive study on all aspects of this particular dimension of the overall arms race. The group of experts has now finalized that study  and  having actively participated in its work  ray delegation looks forward to the Secretary-General's report on the subject  which will be submitted for consideration by the Assembly at this session.It is our sincere hope that the study will generate concerted and concrete follow-up action by Member States  first  through the negotiation of effective measures of nuclear disarmament and confidence-building at sea and  secondly  by identifying possible ways in which naval organization and capabilities may contribute to the establishment of enhanced ocean management policies for the peaceful uses of the sea and its resources  to the benefit of all mankind.Another task of great urgency facing our Organization is to ensure the speedy decolonization of Namibia  for the situation in that Territory not only epitomizes all the odious features of classical colonialism but also contains the added dimensions of racist oppression and illegal plunder of natural resources  thus posing a unique challenge to our collective sense of justice and morality.It is long been self-evident that South Africa has never had any intention whatsoever of co-operating in good faith in the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence  as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Indeed  after blocking the realization of that plan  inter alia  by linking extraneous and irrelevant issues to Namibian independence  the racist Pretoria regime has most recently perpetrated a new act of willful obstruction by establishing yet another so-called ""interim government"" in the Territory in arrogant defiance of world censure and rejection. At the same time  it has not ceased to use Namibia as a launching pad for attacks against the front-line States  as evidenced by the renewed aggression against Angola unleashed just a week ago  in yet another futile attempt to crush the freedom fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).South Africa's stubborn flouting of all accepted norms of international law and civilized behavior and the dismal failure of the policy of so-called constructive engagement have long since convinced my Government that nothing short of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter can bring South Africa to its senses. But while the Security Council has yet to overcome its inability to adopt effective enforcement measures  we cannot afford to wait.We should keep up the pressure by widening international ostracism and the scope of mandatory and voluntary embargoes and boycotts. We should step up concrete support of the Namibian people's struggle  under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and authentic representative. Increased aid should be extended to the front-line States  which are fulfilling a crucial role in the liberation struggle.Pretoria's policies of ruthless oppression and illegal occupation in Namibia are in fact reflective of the inherent nature of the regime itself  which in South Africa has implanted and perfected the obnoxious system of apartheid  a system of institutionalized racism pronounced by the United Nations as a crime against humanity.Indonesia view the latest developments in South Africa with the utmost gravity and concern. The imposition of a state of emergency by the racist regime has unleashed a further escalation of violence  repression and terror. Indeed  the state of emergency - or  more precisely  martial law - has been used by Pretoria as a pretext for its security forces to perpetrate indiscriminate killings and to drag innocent men  women and children from their hones into arbitrary and indefinite detention. Their plight is of serious concern to us  as is the continued incarceration of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  who personify the courageous struggle of black South Africa under the leadership of their national liberation movements. The immediate and unconditional release of all detainees must continue to be our unyielding demand.South Africa's black majority today is under virtual siege. The racist regime has shown itself to possess neither the policy nor the capability for progressive change and that  short of brute force  it is politically bankrupt. Any lingering hopes for a peaceful  evolutionary end to apartheid were dashed by the statement of Prime Minister Botha last month in which he categorically rejected the basic and just demands of the oppressed majority while at the same time demonstrating an arrogant disregard for the legitimate concerns of the international community. But then we knew all along that apartheid cannot be reformed or improved by incremental measures. It must be dismantled in its entirety. In its place  a non-racial  democratic society biased on majority rule should be established as a guarantee *or lasting peace.The Arab-Israel conflict has also been a major preoccupation of the United Nations for most of the 40 years of its existence. Encouraged by the almost unquestioning support extended to it by its friends and protectors  Israel has habitually flouted the cardinal principles and rulings of our Organization. As events over the past years show  Israel persists in its efforts to impose by force of arms its own aggressive and expansionist designs on the region  in complete disregard of world censure.It is the unwavering conviction of my Government that the three core issues of the conflict cannot under any circumstances be sidetrack. They are the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people and its right to sovereign and independent statehood in Palestine  Israel's withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  and the need for the States in the region to live in peace within secure borders.In order to attain these fundamental goals as well as to deal with the multiplicity of contending interests inherent in them  the General Assembly has called for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle Bast under the auspices of the United Nations. Indonesia's support for the peace conference is based on the assumption that such a conference would launch a comprehensive negotiating process and provide a forum in which all the parties concerned would participate on an equal footing  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.There is no question that the convening and success of the peace conference will inevitably depend on the political will and the support of the major Powers  who must eschew their strategic designs on the region and co-operate with the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts to achieve agreement on the modalities for the conference  for surely the alternative can only be an inexorable slidetowards yet another and even more destructive cycle of war and violence  with disastrous consequences  not only for the region  but for the world as a whole.In South-Bast Asia  the situation in Kampuchea continues to be the principal barrier to regional peace and stability. In addressing the Kampuchean question  Indonesia and the other members of Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have consistently maintained a position based on internationally recognized principles rather than on animosity or confrontation. Thus the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchean soil and the establishment of a government of the people's own choosing must necessarily form the basis for any .solution  as this would reflect the essential vindication of those principles.At the same time ASEAN has repeatedly demonstrated its flexibility as regards the modalities for a comprehensive and peaceful settlement which would take into account the legitimate interests of all parties involved. He were dismayed  therefore  by events earlier this year when renewed armed clashes involving the massive use of military force resulted in numerous deaths and widespread destruction and led to the influx of thousands of Kampuchean refugees into Thailand in search of safety and shelter. These developments not only have rendered a solution to the conflict infinitely more difficult but also underscore the tragic dimensions of the current crisis in Kampuchea.In the face of the incessant military operations against its resistance forces  the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (GGDK) has maintained its effectiveness  as well as the continued support of the Karapuchean people. Moreover  the international community's ever-increasing support of the CGDK  under the presidency of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  is another factor of encouragement.During the past year  it was Indonesia's hope that  as the designated interlocutor of ASEAN vis-a-vis Viet Nam  its efforts to promote a genuine dialog and a viable approach to a solution could bring positive results. While the ongoing discussions between Indonesia and Vietnam have brought mutual clarification on- a number of aspects of the problem  differences still exist on some important points and these will have to be resolved if the process towards genuine dialog is to be sustained.In yet another reflection of ASEAN's continuing sincere desire to explore all possible avenues that could lead be the restoration of peace in Kampuchea  the Foreign Ministers meeting in Kuala Lumpur last July proposed proximity talks between the parties directly concerned. As in the past  our initiative has been prompted by a genuine concern for the fundamental rights and interests of the Kampuchean people and their survival as a nation  at peace within its borders and with its neighbors. We continue to hope that Viet Nam will respond positively to international efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Kampuchean problem leading to an independent  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.Similarly it is our sincere hope that a comprehensive solution will soon be found to the problem in Afghanistan  where the continued presence of foreign forces has prevented the restoration of regional peace and stability. With so many regions beset by numerous conflicts and disputes  the progress made by the Contadora group in building a new structure for regional harmony and co-operation in Central America is most heartening. At this juncture  we note with great satisfaction that the Contadora peace process has reached the stage where a meeting of plenipotentiaries could be convened to work out the final modalities with a view to signing the act on peace and co-operation. The culmination of the long and arduous process to establish a framework for regional reconciliation that the act represents will also be a source of emulation for other regions beset with similar problems of conflict and strife.In 1945  freedom from war and economic want were among the central objectives of mankind. Now  four decades later  the issues of international security and development are inextricably linked and in their absence  peace and prosperity cannot be guaranteed. The persistent neglect of pervasive poverty and gross inequalities will gravely endanger the social and political fabric not only of the developing countries but of the world at large. And  as in 1945  their resolution can only be effectively sought through international co-operation. There can be no viable or lasting alternative.Since we assembled here one year ago  the distinguishing features of the global economy and of international economic relations have remained essentially unchanged and are perhaps even more apparent. The halting economic recovery after a devastating global recession  the erosion of multilateralism amidst increasing interdependence  are still our major preoccupations. In addition  the progressive breakdown of the international trading and monetary systems  the stark implications of the international debt problem and the magnitude of the critical economic situation in the roost distressed countries  dominate our agenda at this Assembly and challenge our collective wisdom and resolve.Rather than the promise of imminent growth and progress  the failure of the recovery's expansion throughout the world has been translated into a frustratingly poor performance in most of the developing countries. Even those whose economies were considered to be doing well have experienced setbacks compared to past performance. Escalating protectionism which impedes access to markets  plummeting commodity prices  reduced flows of financial resources and the accumulation of staggering debt burdens are but some of the damaging implications of this failure. Likewise  acute payment imbalances  exchange rate volatility and the imposition of a disproportionate share of the global adjustment process have also inhibited their best efforts. Thus  for many developing countries severe contractions in their development growth and an ominous decline in the living standards of their people have become a harsh reality. For others  especially in Africa  crippling stagnation  if not in fact negative growth  has taken hold and poses a critical threat not only to their social and political stability but often to their very survival.These multiple difficulties attest to the structural inadequacies and inherent imbalances that underlie the current world economic system. There can be no sustained or lasting recovery  nor can there be any acceleration of development in the developing countries  without the promotion of genuine interdependence and a thorough restructuring of the international economic order.It is in the profound awareness of these challenges that we view the urgency of a new vision in international economic co-operation which recognizes that the world economic recovery will be durable only if it is accompanied by comprehensive measures to reactivate the development of the developing countries. The promotion of genuine interdependence among nations and the reinvigoration of multilateral co-operation for development are therefore required. It is precisely in this context that we should like to state again our commitment to the global negotiations. He also believe that the International Development strategy for the third United Nations Development Decade remains absolutely valid.The interrelated issues of trade  money and finance demand our immediate attention. International trade  long recognized as a classic instrument for promoting mutual economic gain  is increasingly being stifled. Indonesia is fully committed to an open international trading system based on the principle of differential and favorable treatment for the developing countries and supports all efforts aimed at the progressive dismantling of protectionism. In commodity trade  we strongly support the implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the full operation of the Common Fund. The decreased flow of development finance has exacerbated the loss of income due to diminishing export earnings and deteriorating terms of trade. The resultant havoc is vividly manifested by the current debt crisis and its many ramifications. A significant increase in the transfer of real resources  be ii official and private  is therefore imperative. A creative and comprehensive response  such as an international conference on money and finance for development  as called for by the New Delhi Seventh Summit Meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should be pursued with urgency.The continuing crisis in Africa as a consequence of the relentless onslaughts of a prolonged drought and famine is not unrelated. While the international response has been remarkable  there is still a tremendous need  beyond emergency relief and crisis management  in this follow-up period of readjustment. Medium and long-term development support are required if the crisis is to be effectively overcome and if future calamities are to be averted.In an international economic situation where disillusionment increasingly reigns  South-South co-operation is not only welcome but indispensable and its intensification is of paramount importance. In this regard the deliberations of the fourth meeting of the Inter-Governmental Follow-Up and Co-ordination Committee of the Group of 77  held in Jakarta a few weeks ago  testified to the enduring relevance and significant importance of the Caracas Program of Action on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries. The strong endorsement for the purposeful implementation of that Program of Action registered at the meeting is encouraging for the future role of collective self-reliance in the acceleration of development. We should not allow this renewed spirit and refreshed momentum to dissipate.Another cause for encouragement is the successful outcome of the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  held in Nairobi last July. Given the crucial role of women in development  we fully support the objectives contained in the document on Forward-looking Strategies and trust that they can be successfully fostered and implemented during the Decade for women and for the balance of this century.As a country whose youth coiEprise over 60 per cent of its population  Indonesia- attaches great importance to the United Nations World Conference for the International Youth Year. The general condition of youth  which reflects the deteriorating world economic situation  in particular job opportunities  has continued to worsen. However  we are fully confidant that the forthcoming World Conference will effectively address this question and thus promote the universal hopes and aspirations of youth.The alarming proportions to which illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse have grown in many parts of the world is a serious danger to the stability and even the security of many countries. Indonesia welcomes the current efforts in combating this grave menace and fully supports the Secretary-General's proposal to convene an international conference on narcotic drugs at the ministerial level in 1987.As the General Assembly has grown in membership  its expanded activities have led the Assembly to become a depository of ever more items for deliberation and debate. Clearly there is a need for streamlining the Assembly's agenda through the removal of items which have ceased to be relevant  the deferral of those that are in the process of negotiation and the grouping of related issues under the same item. Through such an approach the General Assembly could more clearly define its work program and impart greater importance and authority to its decisions.With regard to the Security Council  it is hardly necessary for my delegation to dwell on its shortcomings in the discharge of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The superimposition of East-Nest rivalries on the deliberations of the Council has rendered even unanimously adopted resolutions unimplementable. Moreover  in the process of eliciting support of the permanent members  resolutions become diluted to the point of being mere declaratory exhortations.In order to stem this erosion of the authority and effectiveness of the Security Council  it is essential for the permanent members to recognize their wider international responsibilities inherent in their status and in their acceptance of the Charter. An effective Security Council is essential if we are to avoid the kind of confrontations which in this nuclear age can only mean mutual annihilation.The uncertainty and discord concerning the composition  financing and mandate of peace-keeping operations have often impeded their effectiveness. It is important to search for ways in which consensus could be built to assure global support for such activities. To this end  the roles of the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Secretary-General will require careful reassessment.In the context of restricting and resolving conflict situations  my delegation endorses the various initiatives and actions taken by the Secretary-General in encouraging dialog and negotiations between the parties concerned. While  admittedly  the Secretary-General's untiring efforts have vet to bear fruit in resolving such problems as those of Afghanistan  Cyprus and the Malvinas  he has nonetheless established a framework to facilitate peaceful settlements in accordance with relevant resolutions. It is our sincere hope that the parties to these and other conflicts will extend their unstinted co-operation to the Secretary-General's endeavors to achieve comprehensive and just solutions.Forty years after the establishment of the United Nations  the quest for an effective  peaceful and more equitable international order has slowed and the incentive to develop international institutions commensurate with the realities and risks of our times has weakened. In a world characterized by growing insecurity  regional conflicts  economic dislocation  exploding populations and deteriorating ecosystems and overshadowed by the pervasive threat of nuclear war  the development of a strong and effective United Nations system is a vital imperative. In today's world of intensifying interactions  inter-linkages and interdependence  multilateral co-operation should be the dominant theme. Regrettably  however  bilateral and even mulitaleral policies in pursuit of short-term expediency have made major incursions into multilateralism. Such unpredictable and arbitrary use of power will not only result in greater instability and uncertainty but could precipitate the breakdown even of the existing structures and institutions of international co-operation. Indonesia remains fully convinced that multilateralism is the only viable and responsible approach to the global realities of our time.The United Nations as the embodiment of multilateralism  with all its weaknesses and shortcomings  represents the best available structure for this purpose. It must be supported and strengthened  not undercut and derided. Only then will interdependence become a constructive rather than a negative force in the affairs of mankind.At this critical juncture in the life of the United Nations  the overriding need is for all Member States to rededicate themselves to the principles and purposes of the Charter and to renew their faith in the capacity of the United Nations to fulfill its functions and to meet its aims and objectives. For only then will the Organization be able to assume once more the role for which it was established."
"57",3194,"IND",40,1985,"Sir  I should like to begin by congratulating you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at the fortieth session. You are a distinguished son and eminent representative of a country with which India has close and cordial relations  and your association with the United Nations goes back many years. We are confident that you will provide this Assembly with able stewardship.I should also like to place on record our appreciation of the effective and statesmanlike leadership given to the Assembly at the thirty-ninth session by your predecessor  Mr. Lusaka of Zambia.I wish also to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in the cause of peace and for his patience  perseverance and wisdom. He has won our admiration for his skillful handling of several crisis situations. We wish him continued success and reiterate to him our support.Before proceeding further  allow me to express cm behalf of the people and Government of India our profound grief at the heavy toll in human and material terms claimed by the earthquakes which so tragically struck Mexico last week. We express our solidarity with and support for the people and Government of Mexico in their hour of travail and in their heroic efforts to overcome this unprecedented calamity.Mr. President  you preside today over a historic session. The United Nations has completed 40 years of its existence. These have been years not only of tribulation but also of promise and even achievement. The world is surcharged with suspicion and uncertainty  with incipient as well as overt conflict  but the ideals of the United Nations continue to instill optimism. The dawn of independence and freedom for the overwhelming majority of mankind  particularly in the erstwhile colonial and imperial domains in Asia  Africa and Latin America  has been a significant and welcome development of our times.The generation that launched the United Nations also saw the launching of the nuclear age. While conventional attitudes towards this world Organization are still shaped by the memories of the Second world War  there is today a new specter that haunts our civilization  the specter of a nuclear catastrophe. Hostile military blocs are poised against each other with an armada of nuclear weaponry that could wipe out all life on this planet many times over. Survival in this nuclear age has become the key issue of our times.The United Nations today is the hub of diplomatic activity for the nations of the world. Whatever their divergence in political systems  economic structures or cultural mores  they come together in almost daily contact on a variety of bilateral  multilateral and global issues. Yet this so-called democratization of international relations is only part of the story. On the other hand  the pressures and divisions that characterize contemporary international relations seriously hamper the Organization and reduce its capacity for effective action. As Jawaharlal Nehru stated at the United Nations as early as 1948:""We have got into a cycle of hatred and violence  and not the roost brilliant debate will get you out of it  unless you look some other way and find some other means. It is obvious that if you continue in this cycle and have wars which this Assembly was specially meant to avoid and prevent  the result will be not only tremendous devastation all over the world  but the non-achievement by any individual Power or group of its objective."" In his thought-provoking report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has very aptly characterized the United Nations as an essential element in the historic choice before humanity - between a world of technological promise and one of potentially terminal danger. He has rightly stressed the need to strengthen the concept of international authority embodied in the United Nations as one that should serve as a substitute for ""unilateral action  exclusive alliances end spheres of influence"" (A/40/1  p.2). His specific suggestions deserve careful study and reasoned application.We in India and in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries believe that the United Nations represents  in a real sense  the best hope of mankind. As the late Prime Minister  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  stated in her address to the United Nations General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session  ""Firm faith in the United Nations is central to the non-aligned"" (A/38/PV.9  p.3). Our affinity for the United Nations is rooted in our world view. We cherish peace. We believe in the equality  sovereignty and independence of States. We have a fundamental conviction in the dignity and worth of the human person. The United Nations embodies in itself these lofty principles and more. It constitutes a unique international forum where nations can resolve their differences and work together for the common good of humanity.Throughout the years of India's freedom struggle  our leaders viewed independence not in narrow national terms but as part of the struggle of oppressed peoples everywhere for justice - political  social and economic. Following India's attainment of independence in 1947  our democratic institutions have stabilized and given to our people a deep sense of participation and commitment in determining the nation's priorities in the political and economic fields  as well as in the building up of its social and cultural ethos. In our international relationships  the commitment to the policy of non-alignment has been both instinctive and inevitable. As the Prime Minister of India  Mr. Rajiv Gandhi  has stated:""We have inherited a well-tested and consistent foreign policy which serves our national interest. We have always believed in working for peace. Our policy is to be friends with all countries on the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit. Our commitment to non-alignment and a new world economic order based on justice means a total dedication to the twin causes of peace and development. He also believe in safeguarding the independence of States and upholding the principles of non-interference and non-intervention.""Only a few weeks ago we marked the fortieth anniversary of the dropping of the first nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Memories of that catastrophe make us even more acutely aware of the devastating potential of nuclear arsenals today. As we begin this fifth decade of the nuclear age  the attitudes of nuclear-weapon States towards the possession and use of their nuclear weapons have not undergone any basic change. There is a wide gap between public fears of a nuclear war and the calculations of statesmen and strategists of the efficacy of the nuclear balance of terror. Ever increasing expenditures are being undertaken for the qualitative development of weapons. New generations of weapon systems have come into existence and the militarization of outer space appears imminent. Indeed a whole range of new strategic concepts are being built which seek to smother any sense of moral outrage that humanity may feel over the politics of nuclear confrontation among the most powerful States of the world.All nations stand to suffer to a greater or lesser degree from the impact of the arms race. No one can predict with certainty the devastation that would be caused by a nuclear war. When the immediate effects of the blast and fire- are combined with the long-term effects of the fall-out  the erosion of the ozone layer and the damage to all our planetary life support systems  it is clear that another world war might well bring an end to human history.It is time for us to go the roots of our predicament. If the States most responsible for creating this threat are as yet unprepared to suggest urgent measures for preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war  others should take the lead. There is clearly today a rising tide of protest all around the world against the wasteful and dangerous arms race. The political climate generated by the spontaneous popular movements against the accretion of armaments  against the testing of nuclear weapons and against the use of science and technology forpurposes inconsistent with humanitarian principles  makes it imperative for us to take bold action now.The tendency towards the legitimization of nuclear weapons should be reversed. The process of reduction of nuclear arsenals should be commenced as the only way to build up confidence and trust among States. A commitment by leaders of the major nuclear-weapon States to follow a path of arms limitation rather than arms build-up is the need of the hour. The evolution of healthy national societies in the world can only be ensured if the pervasive influence of an armaments culture  particularly of a nuclear armaments culture  is curbed and the massive expenditure now being directed towards perfecting and modernizing the instruments of war is channeled towards securing more equitable and better conditions of livelihood for the peoples of the world. Even a token reduction in arms expenditure can produce dramatic results if channelized into the development of the less affluent sections of the world. In this context we welcome the convening of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development next year.We have welcomed the resumption of negotiations in Geneva between the United States and the USSR on a complex of questions concerning space and nuclear arms  to be considered and resolved in their interrelationship  with the declared objective of working towards the complete elimination of nuclear arms everywhere. All nations have a stake in the success of the Geneva negotiations and it is  therefore  with some concern that we note that these talks have not produced any concrete results so far. We hope that the forthcoming summit meeting between the leaders of the two countries will give a significant impetus to this process.I should like at this stage to refer to the Delhi Declaration issued at the end of the meeting of the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania who  in January this year  issued a fervent appeal to the nuclear-weapon States to halt all testing  production and deployment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems  to be followed by substantial reduction in their nuclear forces. The Delhi Declaration specified two steps for special attention - the prevention of an arms race in outer space and the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty. These leaders from five continents called for a continuing program of arms reduction leading to general and complete disarmament accompanied by measures to strengthen the United Nations system and to ensure the urgently needed transfer of substantial resources from the arms race to economic and social development.In determining our international political and economic policies we  the non-aligned countries have consistently refused to tailor our responses to the dictates of cold-war predispositions. We do not mortgage our decisions to foreign dictates  we do not seek confrontation. But we urge the necessity of change as the key to the transformation of the world community. India does not believe  however  that such a transformation can be achieved merely by resort to strident rhetoric or by destructive criticism. The test for the international community consists in managing change by peaceful and co-operative means  recognizing the objective imperatives of our situation in the present-day world. Therefore  we seek the widest co-operation of all nations of the world. But we ask that such co-operation be based on equality  justice and a genuine recognition of our mutual interdependence.As nations subjected to colonial domination and racial discrimination we stand firmly committed to the complete elimination of the pernicious practice of apartheid or racism in any form. The situation in southern Africa is an affront to the conscience of mankind. The policies of apartheid of the racist regime in Pretoria constitute a source of tension  instability and conflict  endangering both regional and international peace and security. The recent tragic developments in South Africa  as a result of the fresh wave of terror and repression unleashed by the racist regime following its imposition of a state of emergency  testify to Pretoria's determination to continue its repressive policies. Mr. Botha's statement in Durban of 15 August provided ample proof  if proof were indeed needed  that Pretoria remains wedded to apartheid  that it will continue to turn a deaf ear to the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed majority in South Africa and to the voice of the entire international community  that it will persist in its attempts to divide the struggling majority in South Africa  and that it will show no scruple in killing  maiming and detaining arbitrarily those who dare raise their voice in protest.Recent events make it clear  at the same time  that the people of South Africa will not be cowed into submission. As the special communique on South Africa  adopted by the non-aligned countries at their recent ministerial Conference in Luanda  stated: ""The countdown to the collapse of apartheid has started in earnest"". We call once again for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other valiant freedom fighters under detention. We are convinced that the struggle for a united  democratic and non-fragmented South Africa will  before long  find culmination in final victory. We reiterate to our brothers and sisters in South Africa the assurances of our total solidarity and support.Equally  our hearts go out to the suffering people of Namibia who have now completed a century under oppressive colonial occupation. The same abhorrent regime that persecutes its own people persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia  now close to two decades after the United Nations assumed direct responsibility over the Territory. The attempts by that regime to set up another puppet administration in Namibia through the so-called Multi-Party Conference  have met with the universal contempt and repudiation that they deserve. The Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement on Namibia  held in New Delhi from 19 to 21 April this year  reaffirmed the clear and consistent support of the Non-Aligned Movement for the cause of Namibia and set out a concrete Program of Action to advance that cause. During that historic meeting  India took an important step forward by according full diplomatic status to the representative of the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in New Delhi  thereby reaffirming its firm support for the Namibian cause. The United Nations Security Council  convened in response to thQ call made by the non-aligned countries at New Delhi  has once again called for immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which constitutes the only basis for a peaceful settlement of theNamibian question. Once again. South Africa has spurned that call. It is incumbent on the Council to meet again.It is clear that South Africa could not have persisted in its defiance of the will of the international community for so long but for the diplomatic and moral support and the wide-ranging collaboration in the economic  military  nuclear and other fields that-it has been receiving from its friends and allies. The pursuit of apartheid  the occupation of Namibia  and the repeated acts of aggression against independent African States  jointly and severally  all constitute threats to peace. Yet the Security Council has  time and again  been paralyzed into inaction on account of vetoes cast by one or more of its permanent members against mandatory measures aimed at the total isolation of South Africa. The Pretoria regime is beyond persuasion. Clearly  policies such as those of ""constructive engagement"" have failed. Comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter are the only answer. Meanwhile  States have a moral duty to sever all links with Pretoria. The recent upsurge of public opinion in many parts of the world for more resolute action against South Africa is a welcome development. My country is proud to have led the way in 1946  when we became the first voluntarily to impose comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.Nearer to our own shores  the destabilizing and escalating great-Power military presence in the Indian Ocean causes us great concern. Only the elimination of such presence can enable the nations of the area to shape their own destinies without hindrance or military tutelage from beyond their territorial boundaries. The 1971 Declaration adopted by the United Nations laid down the objective of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean area  which is universally supported by all non-aligned States of the region. These States now call for the early convening in 1986 of a conference on the Indian Ocean in Colombo in order to achieve the realization of the objectives of the Declaration. The participation of all the great Powers at such a conference is crucial  indeed indispensable  to itsall the great Powers at such a conference is crucial  indeed indispensable  to its success. The presence of military bases  command structures and other forms of military presence against the express wishes of the countries of the area only add to the tensions already prevailing in the Indian Ocean littoral and should be progressively reduced and eliminated.Meanwhile  in our own neighborhood  the countries of South Asia have embarked on a process of regional co-operation which holds out significant prospects for the betterment of our peoples. It is important that these developments are not adversely affected by the political and military factors involving the introduction of sophisticated arms serving external strategic interests. As we have repeatedly stressed  it is necessary that the existing thresholds are not crossed or new elements of controversy introduced which could adversely affect the security environment in our neighborhood. We  for our part  are committed to promoting good neighborliness and harmonious relations in the area. It is in this spirit that we look forward to the first summit meeting of the South Asia Regional Cooperation organization in December this year in Dhaka.Our solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to secure the establishment of an independent State in Palestine and the return of the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied by Israel has been a well-recognized plank in the non-aligned platform. The plight of the Palestinians today is indeed one of the supreme tragedies of history. Few people have been more systematically brutalized  oppressed or humiliated in their own lands. The dispersal of the heroic Palestinians will not weaken their will to fight for their inalienable rights. Nor will it bring peace to the area. Occupation of land belonging to its neighbors will not guarantee Israel its security. There is now an increasing understanding of the fact that no comprehensive solution of the problem in the Middle East is attainable without the active involvement of the PLO  the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people. A comprehensive solution of the question can only achieved by a forward-losing approach based on a recognition of the realities of the Palestinian right to an independent State and the right of all the States of the region to live in peace within secure international frontiers. Any such solution must comprise the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable national and human rights  including the right to establish an independent State in their homeland. The situation does not brook delay.We underscore once again the importance of the early convening of the proposed international conference on peace in the Middle East  under the auspices of the United nations and with the participation of all parties concerned  for securing a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the region in accordance with well-established principles. India is ready to extend its full support and co-operation in this connection  and is appreciative of the efforts being undertaken by the Secretary-General.The tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq  two valued members of the non-aligned fraternity  continues to be a matter of concern and anguish. India  along with other non-aligned countries  has taken repeated initiatives to resolve this conflict. Our efforts continue  along with the efforts of the Secretary-General and others.In spite of the valiant efforts of the Contadora group to bring about a peaceful negotiated solution to the problems in Central America  the situation in the region continues to be marked by instability  tension and conflict. Policies of interference and intervention and the threat of the use of force imperil peace and security in the region  complicating its serious social and economic problems. The Government and the people of Nicaragua live under constant threat  harassment and intimidation. The problems of Central America can be resolved only by peaceful means  through political dialog and negotiation. The Contadora group must intensify its efforts to overcome the obstacles in its bid to bring lasting peace to the region. We are distressed by the last-minute impediments which prevented the signing of the revised draft Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America of 7 September 1984. However  we have noted with satisfaction the presentation of a further revised draft  following the meeting in Panama earlier this month. It is our earnest hope that the meeting of plenipotentiaries scheduled for next month will finally pave the way for durable peace to return to this troubled part of the world. The endeavors of the newly constituted Lima group will no doubt strengthen Contadora's hand.We have always affirmed the inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of States  as also of the introduction of foreign troops into any country. The situation in South-West Asia can be resolved only through an overall political settlement based on the principles set out in the New Delhi Declaration. India's own efforts have been directed towards this end. We support the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan. We have closely followed the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  which deserve the fullest support of all concerned.Tension  conflict and instability afflict other parts of the world  including South-East Asia. Cyprus continues to face travail and threats to its sovereignty  independence  unity  territorial integrity and non-aligned status. Tension continues to prevail in the Mediterranean  the South Atlantic and the Pacific region.Colonialism  as I observed earlier  persists in its most virulent form in Namibia. In other parts of the world as well  the task of decolonization remains incomplete. In this twenty-fifth year of the United Nations Declaration on decolonization  tribute is due to the commendable role the United Nations has played in the field of decolonization. We must also reaffirm our Lesolve to eliminate the colonial phenomenon altogether.The world economic environment continues to cause grave concern. At the Seventh Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  our Heads of State or Government stressed that""the international community cannot be assured of durable peace so long as the economic disparities between nations are widening"". The Foreign Ministers of non-aligned countries  meeting at Luanda earlier this month  were constrained to point out that the world economic situation had not improved since 1583.The limited and fragile recovery achieved in some of the industrialized countries  whose spread has remained uneven even amongst; them  is now faltering  because it has been based on unsustainable macro-economic policies. The projections for the rate of growth of the economies of industrialized countries for 1985 and 1986 remain low. The 1985 rate of growth may not exceed 2.8 per cent; it may well be lower.At the same time  the economies of the developing countries remain under heavy pressure. Their overall growth rates remain well below levels which would offset population growth  let alone secure development gains. Combined with the severities of the adjustment process which marked the first three years of this decade  this decline in growth rates has brought into sharp focus the constraints on their economies  threatening wider social and political strife. The developing countries have been making adjustments without any parallel improvement in the world economic environment and in the face of serious resource constraints  the growing menace of an increasingly intolerable debt burden  reverse transfer of financial resources and intensifying protectionist barriers against their exports to developed countries. Against this background  the weakening of the commitment to the spirit of international economic co-operation and an erosion of the multilateral system is a deeply disturbing trend. It is paradoxical that this should be happening when there is an increasingly wider recognition that the world economy has become more interdependent  calling for a greater need to sustain and further the international consensus in favor of development.We have also seen with growing concern the increasing resort to bilateralism or selective multilateralism with the adoption of policies and practices which run counter to the agreed goals and objectives of international economic co-operation. This is a negation of the consensus which the developed countries themselves had helped to achieve.It is apparent that the prevailing international economic crisis cannot be explained away as a cyclical phenomenon. It has its origin in structural inadequacies which have been working to the particular detriment of the developing countries. It calls for a fundamental review of the existing structures.It is essential that the international community renew at this fortieth anniversary session its commitment to the resumption of international negotiations with the objective of stimulating world economic recovery and ensuring sustained growth  particularly of developing countries. This requires in particular an integrated approach in the interrelated areas of money  finance  debt and trade  and a restructuring of international economic relations.The Luanda Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries reaffirmed the strategies for international economic negotiations adopted by the Seventh Summit at New Delhi. The Conference also defined a framewoiU for the commencement of a dialog.I would like to suggest that our immediate efforts should concentrate on the following:First  rectifying through appropriate measures and actions the ""inadequacies and malfunctioning"" of the international monetary and financial system.Secondly  the adoption of policies and actions to implement the agreements on rollback and standstill with a widening o! the access to exports from developing countries and the removal of all infringements on principles  rules and regulations of the international trading system.Thirdly  the adoption of methodologies which would ensure multilateral co-ordination of macro-economic policies pursued by developed countries and the placing of their monetary and financial policies within the purview of international discipline.Fourthly  the increase of financial flows to the developing countries  in particular concessional flows to the low-income countries.Fifthly  making the international adjustment process symmetrical and equitable.I would also like to propose that during this session high-level discussions be undertaken to achieve understandings that would commence the process for the convening of an International Conference on Money and Finance for Development.The critical economic situation in Africa and the drought and famine conditions have evoked a spontaneous response from the international community  including many non-aligned countries. The leaders of the African countries at the twenty-eighth summit Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) have adopted a bold and courageous Declaration in which they have expressed Africa's determination to deal with the challenge of development. It is incumbent on the international community fully to support their efforts. As a token of solidarity  the Non-aligned Movement has adopted a Plan of Action. India has  on its own part  made a contribution of 100 000 tons of wheat  followed by another contribution of $US 10 million to the OAU Special Fund. Under the Plan of Action  India has already identified nine agricultural projects in Africa. Our participation in these projects  which is in an advanced stage of preparation  shall assist in priority areas for the rehabilitation of the agricultural infrastructure. The efforts by India that I have mentioned are additional to the bilateral program that my country has on an ongoing basis with the African countries as a part of which a large number of African experts are undergoing training in Indian institutions  and Indian experts are working in several areas with their African brethren in African countries. This  too  is a contribution to the priority areas of socio-economic development in Africa.As one of the original signatories of the United Nations Charter  India has remained steadfast in its commitment to the values and ideals enshrined therein. To quote once again the words of India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  from a speech he made in 1946 even before we attained our independence:""Towards the United Nations  India's attitude is that of whole-hearted co-operation and unreserved adherence  in both spirit and letter  to the Charter governing it. To that end  India will participate fully in its various activities and actively play that role in its Councils to which her geographical position  population and contribution towards peaceful progress entitle her.""By the same token  the United Nations and its system of specialized agencies have been a valued partner for India in the task of nation building and economic development. For the assistance and co-operation that the United Nations has given us  we are deeply grateful. That  however  is not the only vindication of the trust  hope and confidence that we repose in the United Nations. The importance and utility of the United Nations for us  for the non-aligned and other developing countries  indeed for the entire international community  is to be measured not only by the material assistance the United Nations provides in bettering the quality of life on this planet  but by the higher and more noble aspirations of humanity embodied in this remarkable institution. The greatest tribute that we can pay to the United Nations on this occasion is therefore to rededicate ourselves to the Purposes and Principles of the Charter and to reaffirm our commitment to give them full effect. As this Assembly proclaimed last year  let 1985 ""mark the beginning of an era of durable global peace and justice  social and economic development and progress and independence for all peoples"". We hope indeed that we are on the threshold of such an era."
"58",3240,"IRL",40,1985,"I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the office of President of the General Assembly. We are happy that on the United Nations fortieth birthday the Assembly will be guided by a man of your exceptional skill and experience in international affairs and in the working of this Organization. It is a further source of satisfaction that the President of the Assembly should be a representative of the country with which Ireland has close and friendly relations and which is shortly to join us as a partner in the European Communities.Forty years ago the representatives of 51 nations met in San Francisco to sign the United Nations Charter. Their object was clear: to create a new organization which would prevent mankind from repeating the tragic errors that twice in a generation had plunged the world into war. There could be  and there still is more important task. We who meet here today  the representatives of 159 States  are the heirs to the first signatories  the custodians of a Charter which embodies the noblest aspirations of mankind. It is we  'die current membership of the Organization  who now bear the responsibility for achieving the aims and purposes of the Charter and for making the system created 40 years ago work.The circumstances in which we try to achieve those ends are far removed frost those of 1945. The same global war that gave birth to the United Nations gave birth also to a new international order markedly different from that of the first half of the century and undoubtedly far different from that envisaged by those who framed the Charter. When we look at the United Nations today  and when we try to measure its performance against the hopes of its founders and the expectations of our peoples  it is necessary to bear in mind the momentous changes which have been wrought in international life since the San Francisco Conference. Some of them have been brought about by the United Nations itself. All of them have had a dramatic impact on the shape of the Organization and on its fundamental task of deterring aggression and stopping wars.The colonial empires which covered much of the globe in the first half of the century have been replaced by an international system of over 160 sovereign States * representing almost all the peoples of the Earth. Long-established and powerful States have had to adjust to a reduction in their power and influence and  it must be said  new states have had to come to terms with the limits of sovereignty in an interdependent world. For the United Nations the principal consequence of those developments has been its growth from a wartime alliance of like-minded countries  intent on keeping the peace  to a universal Organization which reflects within itself the tensions  conflicts and antagonisms of international life. The associated fragmentation of common interest and consensus has had a profound effect on the ability of our Organization to harmonize its actions towards common ends.More significantly  perhaps  the prewar order of several major Powers has given way to an international order dominated by the adversarial relationship between the two super-Powers. How to manage that relationship is perhaps the supreme challenge of our age. It is  of course  a matter predominantly for the United States and the Soviet Union themselves  but the quality of the relationship and how it is handled affect us all. They affect especially the operation of the United Nations. For the major rift in international affairs  the East-West split  runs right through the Organization  limiting its ability to tackle the most pressing problems of our time and restricting the scope for imaginative and far-reaching solutions. In particular  the rift runs through the Security Council  the body most directly charged with the preservation of international peace  and inevitably complicates its efforts to that end.The pattern of world politics has also been radically altered by developments in weapons technology. We cannot forget that the same year which saw the birth of this Organization saw  too  the first wartime use of the atomic bomb. We live in the shadow of that terrible event. Nuclear weapons have introduced a new and complex element into the calculus of international power. The unprecedented threat they pose to all humankind has changed utterly the way we think about peace and war. To construct an ethical and political framework capable of withstanding the strains of rapid scientific and technological change is one of the most urgent tasks of our generation.The past four decades have also witnessed a growing consciousness of the imbalances in the international economy. Despite the truly remarkable advances in a number of developing countries  wealth and economic power continue to be concentrated in the developed northern part of the world  while the more populous south must grapple with the problems of impoverishment  widespread hunger and mounting debt.It seems to me that the four themes I have touched on - the need for a multilateral approach to international problems} the management of relations between East and West; the question of disarmament; and the problem of development - constitute the major challenges facing international statesmanship today. Before taking up the important regional issues which feature on our agenda  I should like to outline the views of my Government on these broader issues which affect us all.On its fortieth anniversary it is clear that the United Nations is passing through a period of pubic doubt and skepticism. Indeed  I feel that there is a growing and corrosive cynicism  not just in our public but among those involved in the management of international affairs  about the ability of international organizations to tackle the most difficult problems of our time. It is possible to see why this has happened. Since the early 1970s the United Nations has appeared increasingly marginal in its central task of preventing aggression and resolving conflict. The arms race continues. Mistrust and fear pervade the relations between States. Old conflicts continue and new ones have broken out. Issues such as those of Afghanistan  Kampuchea  the Iran-Iraq war  apartheid  Namibia  are listed on our agenda year after year  annual reminders of our unwillingness or inability to make the system work. There is a grave disproportion between the quantity of work engaged in - all the frenetic activity in the Hall and in the corridors - and the quality of the results achieved. Sometimes it seems that we measure success more in terms of meetings held  documents issued and resolutions adopted than in the number of lives saved or disputes settled or conflicts avoided. In the perception of our public  rhetoric and posturing have all too often taken the place of serious negotiations and diplomacy; narrow national interest has supplanted a broader collective vision.If this pictures seems somewhat sombre in this anniversary year  it must be set beside the Organization's great achievements over the past four decades: its contribution to the process of decolonization; its efforts to protect and promote human rights world-wide; the contribution of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to development  to the eradication of disease and hunger  to education; the United Nations achievements in the field of disarmament  in particular the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and the crucial part the United Nations peace-making and peace-keeping machinery has played in helping to resolve or mitigate several conflicts that threatened to escalate to the international level. When we point to the deficiencies in the operation of the United Nations we must point also to these enduring achievements  without which the world would be a less safe and a less humane place.Yet we cannot ignore what the Secretary-General has described as the crisis in the multilateral approach to international relations. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has  in his four annual reports  outlined in detail the dimensions of the crisis and the consequences for humanity if it is not overcome.What needs to be done to restore confidence in the constructive possibilities of the United Nations?First  I believe we need to establish a sense of realism about what the United Nations can do. The Organization is an imperfect institution operating in a complex and uncertain world. It is an illusion to think that disputes and antagonisms can be eradicated totally from international life. They will persist as long as the nation State exists. What is needed in an international framework sufficiently strong and in which States have sufficient confidence to ensure that antagonisms are managed and conflicts avoided. The primary task of the United-Nations must be to ensure that the pressures and divisions which are intrinsic to an international system of nation States do not lead to war. We should not despair because humanity is divided  but we should see to it that the divide does not widen to engulf us.Secondly  States must come to recognize that they have common interests which transcend national differences and which can be served better by co-operative effort than by individual action. There is an evident need for States to use the mechanisms and procedures of the United Nations as an alternative to the threat or use of force to resolve their differences. This  it seems to me  lies at the core of the malaise which afflicts the United Nations today. In this connection it is well to recall that it was a lack of confidence in co-operative action that hastened the end of the first effort at collective security in this century. We must not let it happen again. A necessary condition for the success of the United Nations is a determination and willingness on the part of its membership to co-operate in making the United Nations system work.Thirdly  there is the question of leadership. The Charter proclaims the sovereign equality of all Members  but we would be misguided if we believed that each of us had an equal capacity to influence events. It is clear that if it is to succeed the United Nations must deal with the realities of power in international life. That is why the major Powers have been given special rights under the Charter  including the right of veto in the Security Council. The corollary of this is that those same Powers  which do have the ability to influence events  must take the lead in making the system relevant and effective. I believe that if those States were to assume their responsibilities in addressing contemporary international ills they would find a ready and positive response among the broad membership of the Organization.In this connection the prospects for international peace and security have been enhanced by recent developments in East-West relations. Two years ago  in the wake of the suspension of the talks on strategic arms reduction and intermediate nuclear forces and in the prevailing climate of challenge and confrontation between the super-Powers  many in this Assembly spoke of the urgent need for a resumption of dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union. Today that dialog is under way. The arms talks in Geneva have been resumed  and the leaders of both super-Powers are shortly to meet at the first United States/Soviet summit for many years. We are encouraged by these developments  even if the way ahead is still uncertain and unclear. We believe that both sides approach the talks with a seriousness and commitment commensurate with the great issues at stake. The challenge for them now is to translate their renewed dialog into enduring agreement.An improvement in the super-Power relationship cannot fail to have a profound and beneficial effect on the overall state of East-West relations. But we recognize that the efforts to improve the overall relationship between East and West is not solely a matter for the Edited States and the Soviet Union. For its part  Ireland is committed to multilateral efforts to bring about genuine detente. This year we have celebrated one such effort in marking the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The process initiated by that Conference represents a central element in the development of more secure and humane relations in Europe. It provides a framework for dialog and co-operation on matters of vital importance to all the States of Europe and North America  including respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Although some of the participating States have not lived up to their commitments  we none the less believe that the CSCE process is indispensable and offers a great opportunity for continued progress.Central to the efforts to reduce tension between East and West is progress on arms control and disarmament. In recent months we have been reminded of the appalling consequences of the use of the atomic bomb 40 years ago. Today  in our quest for a more stable and secure international order  we are still faced with the threat which nuclear weapons pose to the future of mankind.The Non-Proliferation Treaty represents one response to this threat. By bringing together 127 States out of the current United Nations membership in an undertaking not to acquire nuclear-weapon capability  the Treaty has made a significant contribution to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. However  as yet the nuclear-weapon States have failed to respond in kind by working towards radical reductions of their nuclear arsenals. I renew my appeal to the States concerned to take the first step towards nuclear disarmament by working for the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty  and I urge them to undertake a commitment to halt tests at the earliest possible date. In this connection I welcome the successful conclusion of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty last week in Geneva and the agreement readied there on a consensus final declaration calling on the nuclear-weapon States to negotiate without delay on the elaboration and conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.One of the major challenges facing the international community as we approach the 21st century is the exploitation of outer space for the benefit of mankind. The potential for the peaceful use of outer space has already been demonstrated  for example in the field of communications satellites  which make a significantcontribution to the verification of arms-control agreements. However  my Government would be profoundly concerned at any prospect of outer space becoming the arena for a new and highly dangerous arms race  and we believe that there is a need for reliable assurance that it will not be embarked upon. If this is not given  the continued advances in space-related technologies and space weapons could lead to greater international insecurity and to increased risks for all. My Government is therefore greatly encouraged by the decision of the super-Powers to tackle these important issues  together with those of nuclear weapons  in their bilateral talks. Similarly  we welcome the substantive work at the Conference on Disarmament on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. It is our hope that both sets of negotiations will lead to the early conclusion of agreements designed to guarantee the immunity of satellites from attack and also to prevent the use of outer space for purposes contrary to the existing arms-control regime  in particular the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.There in a manifest urgency also in connection with the conclusion of a convention banning the use of chemical weapons. The recent battlefield use of these weapons  which has been justifiably condemned by world opinion  confirms the necessity for a genuine pursuit of an agreement by all parties to the negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament.If political and military security are indispensable to a just and civilized international order  so too are economic security and freedom from want. I am convinced that there can be no real stability until we face up to the problems of uneven development and the unequal distribution of wealth and resources on our shared planet. Some indication  of the dimensions of the problem can be gained from the statistics of deprivation: over 2 billion people live on incomes of less than $500 a year; 500 million people are suffering from hunger and malnutrition; 5 million children die each year from the six most common childhood diseases  which could be prevented at low financial cost; and each year the developing countries must pay almost $70 billion to the industrialized world in interest payments.The figures almost crush our understanding  but faced with them few can question the need to reactivate the process of negotiation between developed and developing countries in the appropriate forums on the interrelated issues of trade  money  debt and aid.What can be done?First  I believe that we must recognize that in a world of economic interdependence our problems can best be resolved by greater multilateral co-operation. Recovery and growth in the world economy can be sustained only if they include the weaker countries as well as the economically powerful.Secondly  and related  we must resist protectionist tendencies in world trade. Developed and developing countries have a joint interest in maintaining a free and open trading system. In this context I hope that the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round will advance the multilateral trading system and contribute to an increase in world trade. Steps also need to be taken to improve the functioning of the international monetary system.Thirdly  we must tackle the problem of debt. An increase in world trade and in the export earnings of developing countries would greatly help. So too would a reduction in interest rates in the developed world. But beyond these there is an urgent need to examine the possibilities of debt rescheduling  increased investment and long-term finance.Fourthly  there is a continuing need for increased multilateral and bilateral aid to overcome structural difficulties and help relieve immediate needs. Multilateral bodies in particular must be ensured sufficient resources to carry out their tasks.Fifthly  we need to ensure that the efforts of development bodies and aid agencies are co-ordinated so that overlapping activities are eradicated and the most effective use made of scarce resources.The imperative of a renewed and sustained effort to achieve long-term development has been demonstrated clearly and tragically by the famine in Africa. Although the situation in the worst-affected areas appears less acute than one year ago  the crisis is far from over. The international response to the disaster from States  international organizations  aid bodies and  indeed  individuals has been impressive and has helped save millions of lives. But the needs are still immense. Over 30 million people are affected by the drought; 10 million are displaced persons living in destitute conditions without food  water  health facilities or sanitation. Despite the international response there remains a huge gap between the aid pledged and the immediate needs. Ireland has contributed to the international aid effort bilaterally and through its membership in the European Communities. We shall continue to support efforts to relieve the immediate needs of the stricken countries  to promote a global and co-ordinated strategy against the drought and desertification  and to resume medium and long-term growth and development in the African countries.A sustained and serious attempt to resolve the global problems I have outlined is prerequisite for a more just and stable international order. But we cannot forget that most of the bloodshed and suffering of the past 40 years has resulted from local and regional conflicts  from civil strife  and from gross abuses of human rights. It is sobering to recall that since our Organization was founded more than 16 million people have died in over 100 major conflicts. Almost without exception these have taken place in the third world - in Africa  Latin America  the Middle East and Asia. A number of these conflict continue today.In South Africa there has been in the past year an explosion of political violence. Hundreds have been killed in clashes between demonstrators and the police and in violence in townships across the country. The South African Government has sought to control the situation by the declaration of a state of emergency - a term that is shorthand for the application of a range of repressive and brutal measures which only add to the turmoil they seek to calm. It is true that there have been suggestions of reform. That in itself is something. But nowhere is there a clear and unequivocal commitment by the South African Government to abandon apartheid and to enter into a serious political dialog involving leaders of the black community.Forty years after the founding of the United Nations we should recall that apartheid has been the subject of debate for 33 of those years  with little tangible progress to show for it. For 23 of those years  Nelson Mandela has languished in a South African prison.Ireland believes that the time is ripe to move from words international action. Already  with the aim of increasing the pressure for change on the South African Government  we have  in concert with our European partners  agreed to implement a series of measures elaborated at Luxembourg on 10 September.Beyond this  however  we believe that only collective action by the international community as a whole will eventually succeed in persuading those who hold power in South Africa to make the commitment to abandon apartheid. Ireland therefore favors the imposition by the Security Council of carefully chosen  graduated and mandatory sanctions against South Africa - to be fully implemented by all.Our goal must be the abolition of apartheid. It is imperative to end a system which is an direct contradiction to every accepted notion of justice  equality and the worth of the human person. We urge the South African Government  in its own interests if nothing else  to accept that fact.Elsewhere in the region  South Africa continues to defy international law and opinion by its occupation of Namibia and its aggressive and destabilizing activities against neighboring States. The setting up of an unrepresentative internal administration in Namibia  already condemned by the Security Council  appears to be yet another ploy designed to complicate Namibia's transition to independence. We insist that South Africa implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We insist  too  that South Africa end its aggressive actions against its neighbors. We condemn unreservedly the South African raid into Botswana and the activities of its forces in Angola.Political instability  economic injustice and human rights abuses continue also in Central America. Ireland is convinced that the approach embodied in the Contadora process continues to offer the best hope of a solution to the manifold problems of that region. We therefore regret that  despite the vigorous efforts of the Contadora Group over the past year the Central American countries have been unable to agree among themselves on the terms of an Act for Peace and Co-operation. The search for agreement deserves and needs all our support. For this reason I believe that the establishment of a Contadora support group by Latin American nations is a positive and encouraging development. For this reason  too  Ireland has been a consistent advocate of the strengthening of political and economic links between the European Community and the Central American countries. The cost to Central America of a breakdown in the Contadora process would be very great indeed. The long-suffering peoples of the region must be given the opportunity to develop their societies in peace and freedom without external intervention.So too must the people of Afghanistan. The continuing conflict there  the suffering of the Afghan people  the plight of the refugees and the burden of neighboring countries bear testimony to the heavy toll of the Soviet intervention. Ireland welcomes the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General's representative and believes that any solution to the Afghanistan conflict must be based on the principles set out in successive United Nations resolutions.My country remains deeply concerned at the continuing failure to bring an end to the conflicts in the Middle East - both because of the suffering and misery which the peoples of that troubled region have had to endure and because of the grave threats which the conflicts there pose to wider international security.In the Gulf the war between Iran and Iraq is now entering its sixth year. We have  together with our partners in the Ten  called on both parties to refrain from bombing civilian targets. We have unequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons. And we have emphasized that the Geneva Convention and other rules of international law must be fully and unconditionally respected. But beyond these efforts  which are intended to reduce the scale and intensity of the conflict  there is a clear and overriding need to bring the war to an end. Ireland will continue to support initiatives such as the Secretary-General's which offer hope of an end to this long and tragic conflict.In Lebanon the bloodshed and loss of life continue in a country deeply divided by religious and communal antagonisms. There is an urgent need to break the cycle of violence and to permit the forces of national reconciliation to emerge. Ireland has appealed to the Lebanese Government and other forces in the country to exercise restraint and to return to the search for peaceful solutions. There is an equal need for restraint by forces outside the country. Israel must complete its withdrawal in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council. A prerequisite for peace in Lebanon is respect by all for Lebanon's territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence.Elsewhere in the region there is some cause for optimism. The Foreign Minister of Luxembourg has already set out in detail the position of the 10 members of the European Communities on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Ireland is encouraged by the peace process initiated earlier this year by King Hussein and Yasser Arafat and we have welcomed the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement as a constructive step forward. The formulation of these proposals required courage and imagination; they demand a courageous and imaginative response from all sides. We look forward now to concrete progress which will permit a fair and lasting peace between the Arab states and Israel and a just solution to the Palestinian problem.But if a fair and lasting solution to this long-standing conflict is to be found I believe that Israel must desist now from actions which could complicate the search for peace and compromise an eventual solution. In this connection  the continued gradual de facto absorption by Israel of the West Bank and Gaza is a matter of real concern and constitutes a growing obstacle to a just solution which would permit the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination.The efforts of the United Nations to promote a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in the Middle East have for many years been buttressed by the work of the United Nations peace-keeping forces and observer missions in the region. In south Lebanon the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has made an important contribution to providing a more stable environment in which longer-term solutions to the problems of the area might be worked out. However  my Government are concerned that UNIFIL  to which Ireland has contributed since its inception  has not been permitted fully to implement its mandate. He call cm all the parties concerned in the conflict to give their full co-operation to the Force to enable it to carry out the tasks assigned to it. If that co-operation continues to be withheld it must seriously call into question the viability of the operation. In this connection  my Government looks forward to the report which the Secretary-General will shortly present to the Security Council on the future of the Force and we shall study his observations and recommendations with the greatest interest.I think it is appropriate that in this anniversary year we honor the service of all who from many lands have contributed so nobly and so selflessly to the work of the United Nations peace-keeping over the past 40 years. Ireland celebrates this year not only the thirtieth anniversary of our membership of the United Nations but the twenty-fifth anniversary of the dispatch of Irish troops on the United Nations peace-keeping mission in the Congo. We are proud to have beeninvolved in almost all United Nations peace-keeping operations since that time. The establishment of the United Nations peace-keeping arm is one of the most encouraging developments in our efforts to construct a safer and more stable world. As the world's capacity for destruction increases the need for continued and sustained support - political and financial - for the United Nations as peace-keeper becomes even more pressing. It is the duty of all of us to ensure that the remarkable achievement which the establishment of the peace-keeping function represents in the first 40 years of the United Nations can be strengthened and renewed for the tasks which lie ahead.Before I conclude I should like to inform the Assembly of the position in Northern Ireland. The background to the problem of Northern Ireland does not require detailed rehearsal here. Within the narrow confines of the north-eastern corner of Ireland there today exist  side-by-side  two communities with separate and conflicting identities and loyalties. Although no single action or event can be adduced to account for these differences and although their origins and causes lie in the deeper recesses of history  the present form of the conflict derives  in large measure  from the character of the enforced political division of Ireland in 1920.During the period of Northern Ireland's separate existence the Irish identity of the minority nationalist community there has essentially been disregarded. Although it is a majority within Northern Ireland itself  the unionist community for its part has always felt its British heritage under threat on account of its status as a minority within the island of Ireland as a whole. As a consequence it has tended to shape the political  civil  judicial and security institutions of Northern Ireland entirely according to its own ethos and in a way which has effectively excluded nationalists from full participation in them. This exclusion is all the more tragic given the strong commitment most nationalists have displayed to peaceful democratic and constitutional methods of seeking redress. As a result  nationalists have become progressively alienated from the political and administrative framework of Northern Ireland and they have had little to show for their adherence to democratic politics.Although the situation has become critical under the cloud of the violence of recent years  hitherto none of the efforts to find and sustain a way out of this political impasse has succeeded. However  an attempt is now being made to approach the problem from a new perspective  an attempt which I believe offers the possibility of progress.Last year  I reported to the General Assembly on the exploratory dialog which had begun between the Irish and British Governments in the aftermath of the publication of the report of the New Ireland Forum. In November 1984 the Taoiseach. Dr. Garret FitzGerald  and the British Prime Minister  Mrs. Margaret Thatcher  met at Chequers in Britain and agreed that:""... the identities of both the majority and minority communities in Northern Ireland should be respected and reflected in the structures and processes of Northern Ireland in ways acceptable to both communities"".This agreement reflected the major requirements for a solution put forward by the Forum in its report six months previously.Clearly  this is the only foundation on which progress can be built and sustained. Progress cannot be made by giving one community a victory at the expense of the other or by threatening in any way the rights of nationalists or of unionists. Instead  progress towards lasting peace and stability requires that the identities  loyalties and outlooks of both communities be accommodated on an equal footing. I  as a member of the Government of Ireland  believe that Irish nationalists have  for our part  made clear through the Forum report our acceptance of unionist rights.The negotiations between the two Governments have continued on the basis of this common diagnosis of the problem. As can be imagined  examining ways of putting flesh on the bones of this agreed view of the problem and devising political structures which would  in practice  protect and promote both identities equally  is a lengthy and arduous process. It is also a process which demands difficult decisions from both Governments. It will soon be time for both Governments to take a final decision to proceed on the basis of the overall package that comes before them.Both unionists and nationalists are naturally concerned about the degree of public uncertainty arising from the confidential nature of these talks. I have great sympathy with their dilemma. In recent weeks we have heard irresponsible voices raised by extremists in both of those communities but most stridently on the unionist side which have sought to exploit these fears and uncertainties and to stir the people up to violence and hatred.Northern nationalists know where I stand. I would now like to use this important occasion to repeat what I have already said to the unionist people of Northern Ireland with all the sincerity and authority at my command. The Irish Government has no designs on their rights. We accept and acknowledge their Britishness. We respect and will respect their reasons for opposing Irish unity. We mean them no ill-will; quite the contrary.Our hope and commitment are to work for the creation of lasting peace and stability and  for the first time  for real harmony  dialog and co-operation between our tradition and theirs. Those who seek to tell them otherwise do so either from ignorance or from sheer malevolence. We say to them  ""Please do not heed them"".Should both our Governments decide to commit themselves to working a new form of political structure in Northern Ireland  no one should underestimate the challenge we will face from those on both sides of the divide who will seek to wreck all hope for the people of both communities through violence and through terror. In that context  international support for the determination of the Irish and British Governments to maintain any new system would be a valuable encouragement to us in what could be a very difficult period. In this connection  I know that we can rely on the helpful and constructive interest of the United Nations and its membership."
"59",3287,"IRN",40,1985,"I wish to offer my congratulations to Ambassador de Pinies on his well-deserved election as President of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly and to thank his predecessor for his noteworthy services.I avail myself of this opportunity to offer the heartfelt condolences of the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Government and people of Mexico in connection with the very tragic earthquakes in that country and express the hope that international co-operation  however inadequate  may help relieve the suffering of the Mexican people.The present session of the General Assembly  which coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  provides us with a welcome opportunity to take a more serious and responsible look at the present unpleasant world situation and  bearing in mind the high ideals of past and present generations  make an earnest effort to fill the gap between their ideals and our practice through constructive suggestions for the strengthening of this Organization so that it can move faster in the direction of our common human ideals.In the course of the four decades of the life of this world Organization sincere  exhaustive and persistent attempts have been made at structuring a comprehensive international order to safeguard world peace and security  to develop friendly international relations on the basis of equality  to win collective co-operation for the resolution of international problems and to close the immense technical and economic gap that exists between the rich and poor countries. The end results of all these worthy efforts are manifested in the present form of the United Nations  which  despite its shortcomings  possesses enormous potential and offers great possibilities to mankind.We are all aware of and agree on the relatively constructive role of the United Nations and its importance in certain complicated situations in the world today. Therefore  instead of utilizing this unique but brief opportunity to restate those common beliefs and praise the fruitful efforts of the United Nations in the political  economic  cultural and social fields  we should make an attempt to identify its weaknesses and find appropriate ways to remove them  in order to strengthen this international Organization.As stated in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization ""The United Nations cannot - and was not intended to - solve all the problems of the international community  but it is the best place to avoid the worst and to strive for improvement."" (A/40/1  p. 3)However  the experience of two world wars which threatened the existence of humanity in less than two decades and a rational analysis of the causes of the failure of the League of Nations to prevent the outbreak of the second of them show that the world community has not yet succeeded in the effective and ideal employment of the great potential of this vast Organization for the just settlement of international disputes and the prevention of aggressive behavior - a regrettable fact that does not leave much room for simple-minded complacency.In our opinion it is not a great achievement for man  as God's supreme creature on earth  to take pride in having occasionally healed his self-inflicted wounds in such an expensive  well-equipped world clinic.The recognition of this reality must serve as the basis for constructive criticism to further the fulfillment of our obligations towards this Organization. The first priority in this approach is to assess the values governing this world Organization  because they are the only criteria for judging the success or failure of the United Nations' performance in the past.There is no doubt that the life of every organization or constitution is dependent upon its value system and it goes without saying that for this very reason the principles  bases  procedures and inevitably the decisions and performance of every organization  and in this particular case the United Nations  are not exempt from value judgments.But the question is: how and by whom are these value judgments made? The founding of the United Nations and the structure of its organs were overshadowed by the special circumstances and conditions of the political and military balance prevailing after the Second World War. Thus the basic concepts and fundamental values of this Organization  as manifested in the Charter of the United Nations  were all formulated within the framework of the historical and cultural values of the victors in the Second World War. That is why they do not represent the shared values of the majority of the members of the world community.One of the principal reasons for the failure of the United Nations since its inception to implement the Articles of the Charter in the settlement or prevention of different international crises  particularly in terms of the issue of peace and security  is deeply rooted in this fundamental defect.Consequently  the concept of justice that should be the main element in the infrastructure of the Charter of the United Nations is not clearly defined and is therefore exposed to all sorts of misinterpretation. A glance at the approach of the united Nations to different crises and problems demonstrates the unambiguous fact that the United Nations has always been mainly concerned with the preservation of the status quo and that the curtailment and temporary stoppage of crises is  in its vocabulary  synonymous with the carrying out of justice. It is quite evident that this approach is hardly likely to result in establishing lasting peace and security or to promise definitive solutions to any problems.The other difficulty  in our opinion  is the fact that the Charter is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. A glaring example of this is the allocation of the right of veto to the few permanent members of the Security Council. Now  however  four decades after the formulation of the Charter  as there is absolutely no justification for the right of veto other countries have followed suit  and in practice behave as if they too were officially granted the same right  tending to disregard all international obligations and decisions whenever the latter happen to clash with their own interests. On the other hand  the Charter and the Organization itself have their raison d'etre in the acceptance of the principle whereby all Members should  in case of a clash between national and supra-national interests  abide by what is judged to be the interests of th? world community.It is manifestly clear that the Charter cannot logically make such unjustifiable exceptions of a few countries as far as this fundamental principle is concerned; by having done so it has made a dead letter of its most basic principle and thereby eliminated all operative guarantees for the execution of the decisions of its Security Council.When we note that from the time of its inception up to September 1985 the Security Council has issued sane 570 resolutions on important international crises  most of which never affected any situation; when we can see very few highlights in the performance of the Security Council; when we consider that the Security Council has failed to put an end to any significant international crisis; when we know that the Security Council's record even in reducing international tension and restricting wars within the framework of existing international laws is insignificant  we are bound to reach the inevitable conclusion that the Council's structure does not logically correlate with the philosophy of its foundation and that it must therefore be replaced by another international apparatus to carry out the important obligation of preserving international peace and security. More significantly  since the foundation of the United Nations  more than 20 million human lives have been lost in the course of some 140 international disputes. Certainly the United Nations has made efforts to prevent or contain such disastrous incidents  but unfortunately existing statistics show that the United Nations efforts have  for a variety of reasons  failed to achieve any substantial results.I do not suppose that I need to emphasize the fact that the obligation to respect one's commitments is the most primary and fundamental basis for every international agreement. There is no doubt that this principle is the basis of all international laws  agreements and organizations. And the destruction of this fundamental principle would be tantamount to nullification of all mankind's achievements over the decades in the form of international laws and conventions designed to enable men to live without destructive wars and to assert the rights of nations in all social fields.I must declare here unequivocally that there is an increasing and alarming trend for aggressors against the rights of nations to attack this fundamentalprinciple. Violation of international laws and norms  especially when questions of international and national peace and security are concerned  is on the increase in variety  quantity and quality  and those human communities which find themselves defenseless in the face of transgressions and aggressions are inevitably drawn to certain unilateral measures and arrangements in order to prepare themselves to confront all sorts of external aggression.The frequent violation of international law discourages the human community from formulating new regulations or improving existing international laws. The majority of international treaties and conventions lack any international executive guarantees.The obvious consequence of this process is an increase in demand for arms and weapons on an international level  the flourishing of the arms markets and merchants of death and intensification of the arms race  as a result of which potential aggressors are often persuaded actually to employ their well-stocked arsenals; and the reinforcement of this vicious circle can only end in the total destruction of all the human and economic resources of our planet.In spite of the fact that colonialism today does not rob the economic resources of these countries and does not swallow their human and intellectual potential through direct military presence in the colonized territories  nevertheless the imposition of inescapable economic conditions on the nations of the third world by controlling markets which set the prices of new materials and industrial products  is the principal cause of the deepening gap between the poor and the rich.Unfortunately the heavy cost of this is primarily borne by the third world. In the past year  we witnessed the debt crisis - which was exacerbated by an increase in the interest rate in the industrial countries - drag many of the debtor nations to the verge of economic bankruptcy  and arms expenditures broke all previous records.We are of the opinion that the correlation between the sharp rise in the debts of the third world countries and expenditures on arms is in no way accidental. In other words  the third world's deep economic problems stem from the price the developing countries have to pay for the insane arms race of the big Powers. This correlation is established either indirectly through the export of economic crises from the industrial countries to the third world  or directly through the creation of political tensions in various regions  resulting in an increased demand for armaments.We should admit that although the efforts of the United Nations and the Secretary-General to slacken the arms race have been conspicuous compared to other activities of this Organization  yet most of the measures ratified have  in effect  been vetoed by the super-Powers.We believe that the United Nations cannot protect the third world  through the establishment of a new economic order  against the export of economic crises by the industrial West  unless these efforts are coupled with parallel efforts to decrease the pace of the arms race. This can only be achieved by the united  synchronized attempts of all the developing and non-aligned countries against obstacles created by the super-Powers in their bilateral and multilateral disarmament talks.However  the super-Powers' persistence in the arms race and their continued efforts to excel each other  make their motives for the future Geneva talks highly suspicious. The super-Powers' carelessness towards the problems of the world community and the international tensions that they create on the strength of their arsenals do not leave much hope that humanity can live in a nuclear-free world in the future. The world community  however  expect their talks -this time to go beyond another boring repetitious show and to bring about some tangible results for the actual reduction in arms and prevention of nuclear war.The United Nations role in preserving international peace and security should undergo a drastic transformation. If these changes require a new definition of obligations  there should not be any hesitation in redefining the United Nations Charter and reorganizing this Organization. The jurisdiction of the Secretary-General  particularly in relation to those conflicts which threaten international peace and security  should increase in such a way that bilateral discussions among the members of the Security Council and the ill wishes of the Powers which benefit from conflicts  do not create impediments for the Secretary-General and the Secretariat in finding just solutions for these conflicts. The United Nations should seriously work out means to guarantee and oversee the implementation of existing international laws  particularly those pertaining to universal human behavior at a time of war. Finding effective punitive measures for those who use force to settle their disputes is among the fundamental duties which should be entrusted to the United Nations. The rate of progress in the disarmament talks  in comparison with the speed of the arms race  is a matter of concern. The direction of these talks should undergo fundamental change and incentives for the arms race should be reduced. A most important consideration by the world community is the absence of an authoritative international body capable of implementing justice in time of conflict. Peace is a sacred word  but the administration of justice precedes that. The existing value system of the United Nations should be reviewed in order to remove this fundamental shortcoming. The qualitative and quantitative development of international organizations is absolutely essential to the present social life of the international community. But the more this need is felt  the more the big Powers become interested in influencing matters.As soon as a number of countries show resistance in an international organization  every possible political and financial pressure is directed against that organization. This is exactly the sort of development we witness in the case of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).In our belief  one of the goals of the Member States on this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations should be a decisive struggle against imperial-minded Powers that attempt to dominate the smooth operation of the international Organization.The United Nations is undoubtedly facing many problems today. Our world  in spite of all the technical and scientific advancements  is suffering from an increasingly wide range of political  economic  cultural and social crises. The economic gap between the first and the third world is widening all the time. Human life on earth is being seriously threatened by an increase in nuclear arms. We should know  however  that all the problems which the world community expects the United Nations to solve  have not come to us from outer space. Rather  they are the direct consequence of the actions of the countries and regimes whose representatives are present here.Our basic problem lies in a lack of political will in this Organization  which results in the adoption of useless resolutions as substitutes for the realization of the aspirations of human communities.The United Nations is the last place for finding peaceful solutions to the crises of a deeply-troubled world. Do not let it become the venue of final deception  since other solutions  whatever they may be  will  alas  not be peaceful.What I have said so far about the United Nations is not a product of subjective analysis; it is  on the contrary  the direct result of what the Islamic Republic of Iran has actually experienced in the last few year's.. The indifference and feeble reactions of the United Nations - and especially those of the Security Council - to the repeated acts of aggression by the Iraqi regime against Iran have given the world a very unfavorable impression of the United Nations in dealing with international tensions and crises.Allow roe to ask members of this Assembly if they know of any international law or humanitarian norm that has not been violated by the Iraqi regime  whenever it could physically do so  for the consolidation of its aggression. If the answer is positive - and the whole world knows that it is - would this single case not be sufficient proof for the Members of the United Nations  and other organizations established to protect peace and security  justifiably to feel that they are left defenseless and alone to face external aggression? Forty years after the establishment of a world Organization which was created after the bitter experience of two world wars in order to prevent future anti-human barbarism  a regime with a five-year record of constant aggression declares most shamelessly that it will only accept ""total war or cease-fire"" in the context of its aggressive objectives.I am convinced that the Assembly fully understands the true meaning of this Iraqi regime's slogan. And the Security Council  which has been rebuffed by the Iraqi regime with respect to its latest statement banning the use of chemical weapons  knows perfectly well that  by this  the Iraqi regime is simply saying that if the Islamic Republic of Iran does not agree with conditions set by this regime -which only serve to consolidate its aggression - then Iraq will be authorized  whenever it so chooses  to violate with impunity all international regulations and conventions that bear its worthless signature.The 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of chemical weapons; the 1949 Geneva Conventions relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War; the Convention relative to the Treatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War; the Annexed Protocol of 1977 to the 1949 Conventions; the 1907 Hague Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land; the 1972 Convention concerning the natural and cultural heritage; the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea concerning maritime pollution and free navigation; the 1944 Chicago Convention; the 1970 Hague Convention concerning the safety of civil aviation; and scores of other international conventions and resolutions to which all Members of this world community have unconditionally committed themselves in order to respect humane considerations in time of war -have they not all been created to improve upon the law of the jungle during wartime?However  for the reasons already cited  and according to resolution 3314 (XXIX) on the Definition of Aggression adopted by the General Assembly in 1974  the Iraqi crimes in its aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran are international crimes and  for this reason  it should also be an international obligation to react to these crimes and to punish the war criminals. The reason for the efforts of the Islamic Republic of Iran to persuade international organizations  and especially the United Nations  to take preventive and punitive action against the Iraqi regime is precisely because these international organizations are duty-bound to do so; but experience has  regrettably  shown us that the only effective way to counter Iraqi aggression is through the use of force.We are certainly not happy to have reached this regrettable conclusion. The repeated violations of the agreement of 12 June 1984 banning raids on residential and civilian areas by the Iraqi regime illustrate the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has had to pay a very heavy price  under most trying circumstances  in abiding by this agreement unilaterally. The price includes some 6 000 civilians who day and night have been subjected to indiscriminate bombardment by Iraqi warplanes and the partial or total destruction of more than 50 towns. As we were paying such a heavy toll  we expected the United Nations to employ all levers at its disposal to stop these inhuman crimes.But it is regret..able to have to admit the bitter fact that it was only our limited retaliatory actions backed by the support of millions of our people on the memorable day of Qods - ""Jerusalem Day"" - which made the Iraqi regime reduce its futile raids on residential and civilian areas. This is not to say that we do not appreciate the very sincere efforts of the Secretary-General  but we are of the opinion that as long as the whole of the United Nations and its organs do not co-operate with the efforts of the Secretary-General  the unilateral actions of the victim of aggression remain the only means of stopping or reducing aggression.Allow me to go over the record of the Security Council and its behavior towards the Iraqi regime that has  as we have already explained  endangered international peace and security. We believe that  despite a slight modification of its unjust stance about this war in its last statement  the Security Council is still far from fulfilling the obligations entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter.I should like to use this opportunity to remove certain ambiguities that may  because of a devotion to or for any other reason  remain in the minds of some representatives. We are sometimes asked why we do not respond to the proposals for a cease-fire or negotiations for the peaceful solution of the conflict made by the Security Council. We think that the way to answer this question is by the Security Council's answering a few other questions.Why did the Security Council  despite its precedents in other international disputes  not condemn the flagrant aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran by Iraq at the very beginning of the imposition of war on two nations  and why is it not ready to do so even now?Why did the Security Council not denounce the Iraqi regime as one that resorted to force for the settlement of its alleged dispute with a neighbor and unilaterally abrogated all bilateral agreements between the two countries?Why did the Security Council  despite its well-known behavior in other international disputes  not request the withdrawal of Iraqi occupying forces from our country in its first resolution on this war?Does all this negligence not point an accusing finger at those who urged Iraq to invade Iran and  in addition to arming that regime to the teeth  helped consolidate its occupying forces in our country through the adoption of such notorious resolutions?Now we ask those with the right of veto in the Council which always veto any decision that apparently goes against their interests how they expect us not to oppose what we consider to be absolute injustice.We have often declared at this world Assembly that when responsible international authorities  especially the Security Council  do not show proper  timely reactions to violations of international law - as was the case when Iraqinvaded Iran and imposed an unwanted war on two nations - this only encourages the aggressor in its aggression. The behavior of the Iraqi regime is the example par excellence of this bitter fact.Could the members of this international body not ask the Security Council why  with the numerous cases of violation of international law by the Iraqi regime in its aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout the course of five long years  it has sufficed to condemn the use of chemical weapons  and that with a one-and-half year delay after their first deployment and without even mentioning the name of the culprit?Between 3 November 1983  when the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran reported the deployment of chemical weapons by Iraq  and between 26 March 1984  when the United Nations Mission to Iran submitted a report on the use of chemical weapons to the Security Council  and 25 April 1985  when the Security Council indirectly condemned the Iraqi regime for this crime  there were two intervals of 18 and 12 months respectively. How is this period of inaction rationalized? Can it be considered acceptable for the Security Council  as an international organ for the investigation of aggression that threatens world peace and security  to be the last party to take a stance on such a horrifying issue? And  even now  can anyone be certain that the Iraqi regime will not use chemical weapons again?Five years have passed since the Iraqi aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Each new year a new series of violations of international law by the Iraqi regime was added to that aggression. The statements and documents of the Secretary-General's missions to the Islamic Republic of Iran for the investigation of Iraqi war crimes  despite the fact that they revealed only small parts of those crimes  must have removed all traces of doubt from the minds of those who sincerely wish for the establishment of a lasting peace in the region and must have convinced them that that unscrupulous regime is not to be fully trusted. Those who simple-heartedly recommend an armed cease-fire must know that  if we put a lid on this fire temporarily  it will at a later date flare up in a far more destructive and devastating manner. We have no choice  therefore  even if we have to go through fire and water  but to extinguish it for ever.The Islamic Republic of Iran is therefore determined to continue its just struggle for the full realization of justice  and by this  we mean circumstances in which the aggressor is properly punished and long-term peace and security in the region is firmly guaranteed. Any other solutions would only result in the payment of heavier prices in the future by us and other countries that have suffered from Iraq's aggression in the past. I believe that one thing is quite clear: the actions of the Iraqi regime in the last few months alone demonstrated that that regime spared no effort to bring oil exports and navigation by the littoral States of the Persian Gulf to a complete halt  and by doing this it was aiming at creating an economic oil crisis which would encourage the super-Powers to interfere in our regional affairs.One problem that may serve as a proper criterion for the evaluation of the executive power  the range of effect and the stance of the United Nations in the settlement of world problems is the question of Palestine. I believe that the United Nations has issued more resolutions and statements and organized more seminars and meetings in the case of Palestine than in that of any other problem. The minds and souls of some 1 billion Moslems throughout the world are anxiously preoccupied with this question. No part of the world has ever witnessed so much cruelty  aggression  occupation and usurpation of people's rights for so long a time. No other international issue has ever drained so much of the financial and economic resources of so many countries.Perhaps in no other area has international .'Law been violated to such an amazing extent. No other regional problem has ever involved so many different countries around a single issue. And on no other issue  when there was a flicker of hope for curbing aggression  has the United States of America so frequently used its unjust right of veto in order to expand and strengthen the criminal Israeli acts of aggression.Despite all this  from among all questions and problems treated by the United Nations  there is scarcely an issue for the settlement of which the total performance of the United Nations has been so insignificant. As a result  the Zionist regime  supported by United States imperialism  has with impunity and without even lessening the scale of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people with regard to the views of the United Nations  continued to destroy the human  cultural  historical and economic resources of the Palestinian nation more rapidly.There are no limits to the evil consequences of this bitter fact. The Zionist regime has in fact  become a model of aggression  teaching potential aggressors in the world how to violate people's rights and how to ignore the reactions of the United Nations.The Iraqi regime has been a good disciple of Israel. It has simply followed the Zionist regime's practices in the violation of international law while paying no attention to the international consequences of its actions. Is it not  therefore  the time for the United Nations to seriously change direction as far as its procedures and practices are concerned  in order to turn itself into an instrument for the execution of its Members' will to end such violations?Do the disasters inflicted on the people of Lebanon and Palestine during the last twelve months not make a fundamental change in the performance of theUnited Nations a necessity? Do the bloodstained roads and by-roads of Lebanese villages point to anything but the' inaction of international organizations  especially the United Nations? Does the split blood of the innocent Lebanese people not cry out for the conviction of those regimes in the region whose compromised positions were revealed in the so-called Jordan-Palestinian proposal? Are the statements made in the Assembly by certain heads of States promoting the infamous policy of ""compromise and capitulate"" to the usurper Zionist regime  not intended to bury the cause of the Palestinian people forever?We declare here that the treacherous efforts by the Amman-Baghdad-Cairo axis for recognition and legitimization of the usurper Zionist regime are doomed to failure. We are convinced that the Islamic Ummat will in time confront this aggressor and restore its stolen rights in Palestine  the Golan Heights  the Gaza Strip  the West Bank  the Lebanon  Egypt and now Tunisia. The latest raid on • Tunisia by the latter-day Nazis occupying Palestine  which was carried out in complete harmony with the United States  serves as another reminder to certain reactionary  compromising elements in our region  that retreating before an aggressive enemy will only make it more violent. It demonstrated once again that the Zionist regime knows no limits for its aggressions and that all Arab and Islamic countries are potential targets for the future invasions of this satanic regime. In other words  this latest act of aggression is the proper reward for those who at this very rostrum uselessly praised the Israeli and American regimes.The Muslims of Palestine  having learned this lesson whole-heartedly  continue their struggle to regain their usurped rights  and no plots may weaken their resolve for the liberation of Palestine and driving the big Powers out of their homeland.In reviewing the record of the United Nations and its affiliated organs  we sometimes come across certain encouraging signs  such as the verdict of the International Court of Justice at the Hague on American aggression against Nicaragua. The value of this decision is more clearly recognized when we see the United States declaring that the ruling was outside the jurisdiction of this universally recognized international court. Such equitable decisions by united Nations organs should be strongly supported and helped to become dominant in the Organization. Otherwise aggression against independent countries and intervention in their affairs  and imposition of illegal jurisdiction  such as the so-called mobile sovereignty in the Persian Gulf and other areas granted to the United States fleet by the United States pirate Government itself  will continue unabated. The United States is also intervening in the internal affairs of Nicaragua and El Salvador and continuously tries to expand its hegemony over Latin American countries in political  military  and economic matters.It is with regret that we have to mention other sensitive issues receiving similar treatment by the super-Powers in the United Nations. The ongoing talks on Afghanistan is one such issue.Five years have passed since talks commenced under the auspices of the United Nations aimed at ending the occupation of Afghanistan. Due to certain reasons  however  there seems to be no tangible change in the position of the occupying party. This is what the Islamic Republic of Iran predicted from the very beginning  knowing that the absence of the true representatives of the Afghan people and the conditions set by the occupying forces for immediate withdrawal  had doomed the entire exercise to failure. But the United Nations  which already had the experience of dealing with similar issues for nearly 40 years  has not paid due attention to these two negative factors in these talks. Thus  we may ask  what is now the justification for the continuation of the talks?Have these talks resulted in anything but entertainment for world public opinion and diverting it from the original question which was supposed to be the unjustified continuation of the occupation of Afghanistan? This problem can be solved only through the unconditional and Mediate withdrawal of the occupation forces  non-replacement of these troops by other imperialist forces  voluntary return of all Afghan refugees to their homeland  respect for Afghan national integrity  and the determination of the future of Afghanistan by the Afghan people themselves.The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the political crisis in South-East Asia  especially in Kampuchea  can be overcome only on the basis of the wishes of the peoples of that area and in an atmosphere free from great-Power intervention; the Islamic Republic of Iran also supports the aspirations of the Korean people for the unification of their country. On other continents  we must condemn the military occupation of the Argentinian Malvinas Islands and voice our strong support for the struggle of the people of Western Sahara for independence  and for the decisions of the Organization of African Unity and the united Nations in this respect.Although the United Nations attitude towards the problem of South Africa is clear in comparison with other issues  what is happening in South Africa is a disgrace to humanity. Apartheid is a tunnel that bypasses all the intellectual  cultural and ethical achievements of mankind and links the 20th century to the dark ages of the past. The assistance granted by imperialism  particularly by the United States of America and its satellites  both in overt and covert forms  strengthens and fortifies this horrendous tunnel. The ruling clique in South Africa  supported by imperialism  has not only engaged in the shameless arrest and indiscriminate murder of the leaders of the anti-apartheid campaign but has also stepped up its acts of aggression against the front-line countries.Not only the South African aggression but also the political realities and  more particularly  the economic situation of the African continent deserve our greater attention. Of course certain constructive measures taken by the United Nations' and the Secretary-General to channel economic assistance to the famine-stricken people of Africa in the past year are to be appreciated; but this aid  plus the voluntary assistance provided by some countries  is far too little to meet the real needs of the African people. The Islamic Republic of Iran has  as aduty  extended a helping hand  but  unfortunately  because of problems emanating from the war imposed on us  assistance has not readied satisfying levels. Here I deem it necessary to draw the attention of other countries to this human responsibility which all of us must shoulder. How can we justify the poverty  hunger  famine and deprivation of large numbers of people in an era identified with progress and development? How will God and history judge us when we witness the deaths of tens of thousands of people from starvation and deprivation and still spend a great amount of our wealth and natural resources on a lunatic arms race? Can humanity take any pride in centuries of cultural and intellectual advances in view of such diabolical crimes?I hope this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will be marked as the beginning of the end of the miseries of mankind; an anniversary for the deepening and consolidating of human bonds  the development of bilateral relations  the establishment of peace  the negation of domination and aggression and the securing of justice throughout the world."
"60",3334,"IRQ",40,1985,"It gives me great pleasure to offer my most sincere congratulations to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly. I am confident that his competence and long experience in the United Nations will be an asset to us all in our endeavors to reach positiveresults at this historic session. What we find even more gratifying is the fact that he represents a country with which the Arab nation has had a long history of mutual friendship and inter-cultural relations. The delegation of Iraq wishes to assure him of its readiness to extend its fullest co-operation in contributing to the successful execution of his responsibilities.I wish also to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General once more our confidence in him and our appreciation of his painstaking efforts in the service of the principles of the United Nations.The current session of the United Nations has a historic significance  in that it embodies a commemorative occasion upon which we ought to pause and consider the road that the Organization has traveled since its foundation. In the normal way we come to the rostrum of the United Nations to air our views about the major issues facing us  but in this particular year it is our duty in dealing with such issues to approach the facts candidly and realistically in the hope that we may better preserve the principles upon which the Organization was founded. Most important among those principles is the establishment of peace  which the peoples of the world see as essential to the exercise of their rights to sovereignty  security and dignity  and without which justice in the world will give way to chaos and destruction.My country and the other countries of our region stand in greater danger of aggression than any other part of the world  and are therefore in greater need of peace and stability and of the implementation of the principles upon which the Organization was founded 40 years ago.In our region  there are two regimes that seek their objectives through policies of aggression and expansion at the expense of neighboring States  policies they carry out with impunity. Unrestrained by conscience  the Zionist and Iranian regimes have demonstrated a total lack of responsibility in their persistent disregard for the United Nations and their continual violations of its Charter. Our Organization has yet to succeed in compelling those two regimes to respect its authority and abide by the principles agreed upon by the whole of civilized mankind.The United Nations is not unaware of the facts of the Iranian aggression against my country. Iraqi representatives have submitted sufficient documents about the facts  together with detailed statements about my country's position  since the beginning of Iran's aggression more than five years ago  an aggression which has figured high on the United Nations agenda. The most flagrant fact about this aggression is Iran's undisguised objective - the toppling of the political and social systems in Iraq and other countries in the region  where the Iranians want to establish their own brand of backward and barbaric rule. That bizarre course of action  which the Iranian regime is determined to pursue against Iraq and other countries  is basically the main cause of Iran's continued aggression and of the dangers and turbulences threatening our region.Iraq's increasing efforts  together with those of other countries in the region  to establish normal relations with Iran  based on the principles of good-neighborliness  mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  have all been in vain. From the very beginning the Iranian regime insisted upon fomenting trouble and applying its expansionist policies in the area. It started its aggression against Iraq by shelling innocent civilian border towns with heavy artillery in preparation for its full-scale invasion of Iraq and occupation of its territories by force.Faced with such imminent dangers  Iraq had no choice but to defend its sovereignty and security. The international Organization has been trying since that time to resolve the dispute on the basis of the Charter and within the means available to it. It passed Security Council resolution 479 (1980)  its first on the dispute  on 28 September 1980  calling upon the warring parties to cease hostilities and to settle their differences by peaceful means. While Iran rejected that resolution  Iraq not only agreed to it  but also accepted in all sincerity the Organization's jurisdiction over the dispute  together with every resolution it was to pass calling for the dispute to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the Charter. Iraq also accepted the jurisdiction of other international organizations  such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. The Iranian regime has  on its part  rejected all resolutions adopted to date by this or any other international Organization. Iran has tried instead to impose preconditions for ending the war that were both ridiculous and contrary to the rules of international law and the principles of international relations. These preconditions not only reflect the anomalous nature of the Iranian regime  but also accurately reveal its evil  expansionist and aggressive intentions.When  in an attempt to resolve certain issues related to the conflict  international efforts were begun with a view on mitigating the war's overall effect  Iraq co-operated in all sincerity with those efforts in the hope that peace could be established step by step. The reality of *he situation  however  has shown beyond any doubt that the Iranian regime's response to those efforts has been opportunistic and time serving  very much in line with its plans to prolong the war and to achieve its neurotic  sick dreams to dominate Iraq and other countries in the region.We are all well aware of the unfounded claims that the barbaric Iranian regime has been making in its campaign of crocodile tears with regard to certain issues related to its own aggression and caused by its own insistence upon prolonging it.On the question of shelling populated civilian areas  I need not go into a detailed account of the already documented and established facts about how  on 4 September 1980  the Iranian regime began shelling Iraqi cities and civilian centers and about how it has continued to do so ever since that date whenever its aircraft found an opportunity to penetrate Iraqi air space.The important fact in this issue is that on 27 June 1983 President Saddam Hussein of the Iraqi Republic proposed that a special agreement be signed between the two countries  under the auspices of the United Nations  which would protect civilian targets from further attacks. But Iran rejected that proposal  and that rejection was noted in a special paragraph of Security Council resolution 540 (1983) adopted in 1983 and also rejected by Iran.Only after Iraq had foiled and completely destroyed Iran's major offensive against its southern sector in February 1984 did the Iranian regime begin to show any interest in this matter and to call upon the international Organization to do something about it.The Secretary-General's subsequent initiative brought about the 12 June 1984 agreement  according to which each side undertook to refrain from deliberate attacks on purely civilian centers. That obligation  however  did not deter the Iranian regime from bypassing the agreement.by turning its border towns and villages into areas of military concentrations. He warned against this in my letter of 27 June 1984 (document S/16649). In that letter I demanded that a sufficient number of observers be dispatched to the area to supervise implementation of the agreement. The Iranian regime rejected the idea from the outset but ultimately agreed to allow the team of observers to stay in Tehran without giving them the right to make inspection visits to the areas covered by the agreement in order to verify its implementation.After this we began to receive false Iranian claims of Iraqi violations of the agreement  and Iran's President went so far as to issue a statement on 8 February 1985 in which he threatened to shell the city of Basrah and warned its inhabitants to leave town (document S/16948). The same warning was repeated on 4 March 1985  giving the people of Basrah only 12 hours to evacuate toe city.Ostensibly in response to a raid carried out by Iraqi planes on a factory in the suburbs of Ahwaz  an area not covered by the agreement  a further violation of the agreement occurred at the same time as we were negotiating the matter of prisoners of war here in New York in the Security Council in the hope of finding a solution to their tragic predicament.The Iranian threat was in fact carried out  and Basrah was subjected to severe shelling. Yet all this was only a prelude to what was to be Iran's largest and fiercest offensive against the southern sector of Iraq. That offensive  which began on 12 March 1985  was aimed at occupying southern Iraq and installing a puppet regime there. The offensive was carried out despite an appeal issued by the Secretary-General only three days before in which he had asked both parties to refrain from shelling cities. Our positive response to the Secretary-General's appeal was immediate. He expressed Iraq's complete readiness to participate in the negotiations conducted under his auspices with a view to drawing up effective measures whereby the 12 June agreement would no longer be open to exploitation for aggressive  militaristic purposes.Does this leave any doubt as to Iran's real intentions in accepting the said agreement? The Iranian regime's acceptance of it was a diversionary tactic and an attempt to neutralize Iraqi strikes against Iranian military concentrations. Part of the diversion also consisted in Iran's deliberate violation of the agreement in an attempt to launch its offensive in an atmosphere of chaos.Let us briefly consider the issue of the raids on ships. In 1983 Iraq called for serious measures to be taken to maintain security and stability in the Arab Gulf and to guarantee free navigation for all States  regardless of whether they are or are not part of the Gulf area. That proposal was welcomed by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council and by all those eager to see security and stability prevail in our region and in the world at large.The spirit of that proposal was also reflected in the legal and political principles embodied in Security Council resolution 540 (1983) of 31 October 1983   a resolution that equitably safeguards the interests of all States in the Arab Gulf area as well as those of the international community and of international navigation and trade.Although that resolution called for only a partial cessation of hostilities between the two countries  which may in fact have contributed to prolonging the war  Iraq welcomed it  as did the Golf Co operation Council and all international circles. The Iranian regime  however  rejected that resolution and spurned all international efforts that sought to justify the rejection as a gesture of courtesy to Iran in an attempt to lure it into accepting some kind of undeclared realistic commitment to the resolution.The Iranians rejected all this because they were preparing a new major offensive against Basrah  one that was eventually carried out in February 1984. However  having seen their offensive foiled  their forces destroyed and their ports blockaded in response to the blockade they themselves had imposed on our ports since the outbreak of the war  the Iranians began to feel the bite of the situation.Their regime began to cry wolf about threats posed by the blockade to international navigation in the Gulf. Tehran cried out for international law to be observed. But instead of approaching the situation with prudence by accepting resolution 540 (1983)  which is both wise and balanced  the rulers of Iran resorted to attacking vessels belonging to the Arab Gulf States that were in no way involved in the armed conflict. Iran's objective in these attacks was to force the Gulf States to put pressure on Iraq and make it end its blockade of Iranian ports. This was embodied in Security Council resolution 552 (1984)  which was also rejected by Iran  together with all other efforts aimed at easing the conflict and reaching a balanced solution in which nations!  regional and international navigational interests were to be safeguarded. Instead  Iran persisted in exercising its policy of piracy and terror against the countries of the region.The reason behind this behavior of the Tehran rulers was the same as that which made them reject resolution 54Q (1983) in a previous year. It was that they were preparing for their major offensive of March 1985  aimed at occupying Basrah and installing a puppet government there. Again  as they saw their invasion destroyed by our defense forces  they began to talk of international law and freedom of navigation.What is worth pointing out here is that the Iranian regime understands the rules of international law and free navigation only in so far as they serve its military objectives. That regime has never stopped its raids against neutral vessels or refrained from its other acts of piracy. Iran has launched 19 such raids since September 1984  in addition to 45 other acts of piracy carried out since the beginning of that year. They were directed not only against Arab targets; the list includes vessels from India  Spain  Greece  South Korea  Liberia  Panama  West Germany  Britain  Belgium and China  as well as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.Let us consider the tragedy of the prisoners of war. The Tehran authorities have always treated Iraqi prisoners of war on the basis of the political premise of Iranian expansionist territorial ambitions in Iraq. Not only have they premeditatedly killed those prisoners of war who had refused to succumb to their will; they have also planted among the rest of them Iranian elements who have previously resided in Iraq. The aim of this measure is to spread psychological terror and to impose political and physical oppression with a view to undermining the allegiance of the prisoners of war to their country. These practices were such that the head of the International Red Cross team that visited the area on a fact-finding mission confirmed  in a report dated 23 November 1984  that Iranian treatment of Iraqi prisoners of war left them with but two choices: treason or death. The team itself was treated extremely badly by the Iranian authorities - to such an extent that it was forced to abandon its work in Iran.When the report of the Secretary-General's mission was published  we attended the Security Council meeting of 4 March 1985 to discuss the subject. As usual  Iran was conspicuous for its absence. The reason was  yet again  its preparation for the March 1985 offensive  which  having been foiled  left the Tehran regime with nothing to do but to feign concern about the conditions of the prisoners of war and to pretend to be interested in finding partial solutions to their problem  which  in reality is a horrific tragedy. Of course  this came at a time when  as one is bound to remind the Assembly  the Iranian rulers themselves had refused to consider an Iraqi proposal for a comprehensive solution to the prisoner-of-war dilemma  a proposal I submitted to the Secretariat in a letter dated 9 March 1985.If those rulers actually possessed only some of the human attributes they claimed for themselves  they should not have rejected Iraq's reasoned  all-embracing solution to the prisoner-of-war problem  a solution widely appreciated in the international circles concerned. Nor should they have persisted in producing lies about their treatment of Iraqi prisoners of war.As I explained to the Security Council on 4 March 1985  the Iranian rulers do not consider the question of the prisoners of war a humanitarian issue. They think of them rather as a political card they can use to promote their expansionist schemes against Iraq. From time to time Iran cries wolf about the principles of international law. Yet these cries remain only part of Iran's propaganda tactics.What is true of Iranian behavior in relation to the shelling of civilian centers  the attacks on ships or the treatment of prisoners of war is also true in relation to other issues in the conflict  such as aviation and the use of chemical weapons  which are often brought up by the Iranian regime. The common denominator in these issues  as far as Iranian conduct is concerned  remains the fact that the Iranian regime usually takes a selective  self-interested stand towards the United Nations Charter and international law. Iran picks only those parts it finds suitable for its own ends and its plans to prolong the war and rejects those that call for peace and justice  for adherence to the principles of sovereignty  good-neighborliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  and for the abandonment of all forms of hegemony  domination  force  terror findaggression.If the Iranian regime had really been interested in observing international law  it should not have raised the slogan ""a clean war""  nor should Iran have continued to launch its limited and major offensives against Iraqi territories regardless of the huge losses sustained by its forces in the process.The number of Iranian military offensives launched against Iraq  for instance  from September 1984 to September 1985 readied 16. Four of these offensives were major ones  including two in the northern sector  one in the middle sector and another in the southern sector. The remaining 12 were launched against the southern sectors of Iraq. In none of these offensives has the Iranian regime been able to. achieve any of its objectives its forces have sustained huge losses in both men and equipment.Iran's insistence upon continuing the war in the hope of achieving its expansionist dreams in Iraq and the region  combined with its eclectic and self-interested approach to international conventions and agreements  has been the main reason for the failure of the theory that peace can be achieved through partial settlements. From the very beginning  in the light of our close awareness of the real nature of the Iranian regime  we did not expect that theory to produce positive results. Yet we treated it in the spirit of hope and co-operation to show the world once again our sincere wish to reach a just and honorable peace based on the Charter  international law and the principles of sovereignty  independence  non-interference and the For these reasons and in the light of our bitter experiences with the Iranian regime  which thrives cm ideas totally at odds with the spirit of the age and contrary to the rules and practices of modern international relations  it has become imperative that we view with extreme caution efforts aimed at finding partial solutions to issues related to the conflict. Such a method has succeeded only in enabling the Iranian regime to prolong the war over a period of more than five years. Peace is one  an indivisible whole  and if peace is to be realized  then all good efforts must be directed towards achieving it comprehensively according to a practicable program which has no room for exploitation.This is the position which I conveyed to the Secretariat on 16 March 1985 in document S/17037 and which provided the basis for our talks with the Secretary-General in New York on 24 March  when he proposed his eight-point program to both countries  as well as on 8 and 9 April  when he visited our capital. It is also the position expressed by President Saddam Hussein in his letter to the Iranian peoples of 14 June 1985.It is important to pause here and remind ourselves of the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council after his trip to Iran and Iraq  a report contained in document S/17097. In that report the Secretary-General indicated that  although his consultations with the two sides did not reduce the gap between them  there remained real grounds for efforts to continue being exerted in order to bring peace closer. He also expressed the conviction that the first necessary step on the road to peace should be a meeting of the Security Council attended by both parties to the conflict and at which all aspects of the conflict would be discussed and reviewed.What has taken place? Members of the Security Council thought that the best way to bring the Iranian regime to the Council table would be throughappeasement. Hence came the Council's statement of 25 April  which attempted to balance the Council's earlier call for a cessation of hostilities embodied in its statement of 15 March. What was the result? The Iranian rulers announced that the statement of 25 April was still insufficient and that any positive response on their part remained subject to the implementation of their ridiculous preconditions  which are contrary to the United Nations Charter and international law.Thus  the logic of appeasement has led to a stalemate in the sound implementation of the principles of the Charter and international law. It has also alleviated international pressure on the aggressor and practically allowed him to continue his aggression. Appeasement and courtesy do not pay with expansionist  aggressive regimes nor do they promote the objectives of peace  security and stability  for such regimes may interpret appeasement as the willingness to overlook criminal practices and violations of the rules of international relations  and may thus be encouraged to persist in their policies of aggression  sabotage and terrorism.The Palestinian question  including the rights of the Arab Palestinian people  has been one of the most important issues in the United Nations since its foundation  while the tragedy of this dispersed people remains a pressing matter  the Arabs of Palestine are repeatedly subjected to massacre and extermination. The objective has always been to eliminate this people's heritage  identity and very existence. The Palestinians continue to suffer the most inhuman treatment at the hands of their Zionist oppressors  whose racist measures have included not only expulsion  dispersion  confiscation of property  and so on  but also the establishment of Zionist settlements on Arab lands.We strongly support the struggle of the Arab Palestinian people under the leadership of its sole  legitimate representative for the restoration of its inalienable national rights. He also strongly support the political and non-political struggle of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to attain the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.The flagrant violations and aggressive acts that the Arab nation has faced during the past 10 years have revealed the extent of convergence of the political aims of the racist regimes in the region. The Zionist raid against Iraq's peaceful nuclear installations in 1981  the first of its kind  was timed and carried out in full harmony with an aggressive war which the rulers of Iran persist in launching and intensifying against our country. This highlights the extent of the collaboration between the regimes of Tehran and Tel Aviv in executing their criminal schemes against Iraq and the Arab nation. The main objective of these schemes is to deprive the Arab nation of its opportunities for progress and prosperity and to prevent it from taking its rightful place among civilized nations. They also aim at the dismemberment of this nation into mini-States and warring factions. The ongoing destruction and fragmentation of Lebanon  while demonstrating the extent of the damage that the combined efforts of these two aggressive regimes can cause  call for immediate measures to protect this State from partition and total disintegration  and to restore to it the peace  stability and unity it once enjoyed.On this historic occasion at the United Nations  it seems more important than ever before that we do not confine our efforts to making statements and issuing declarations  of which too many have already been produced. The future of this Organization and the credibility of its Members' resolve to defend  protect and improve it for the benefit of peace rests first and foremost upon our willingness to turn words into deeds. To achieve this  practical and effective measures are required.We ought to remember as well the important issue taken up by the Secretary-General in his annual report  an issue which he describes as being ""not so much  the future of the United Nations as the future of humanity and of our planet and the role of the United Nations in that future"" (A/40/1  p. 2). In his report the Secretary-General recommends that the Security Council exert  in the near future  special concerted efforts to resolve one or two of the major problems before it  taking whatever measures and actions it deems necessary within the framework of the Charter.We call upon the United Nations in general  and the Security Council and the Secretariat  in particular  to find a comprehensive settlement to the Iraq-Iran conflict; a settlement that will ensure peace and justice through the authority vested in the Council by the Charter. The Council shoulders a special responsibility to rise above partial and narrow interests and to view issues through common international interests. These common interests cannot be maintained without deterring the party that takes an aggressive stand by insisting on war and rejecting peace. This is  of course  a stand shared by the Iranian and Zionist regimes  which have both ignored and ridiculed the various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council. Just as the Iranian regime insists upon continuing its aggression against Iraq and rejecting all proposals for a just and honorable peace  the Zionist regime maintains its policies of aggression  repression and racial discrimination against the Arab people of Palestine.Without deterrent action and the measures required to make it effect  the United Nations will remain merely a rostrum for grievances  incapable of living up to its founders' intention of creating an international body through which peace and security in the world could be effectively maintained.In the light of our categorical rejection of all forms of racial discrimination  we hereby reiterate our fa*** support for  and solidarity with  the people of Namibia in its struggle for liberty and independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its sole legitimate representative. We also condemn the racist policies practiced by the Pretoria regime against the struggling peoples of Namibia and South Africa. We affirm these peoples* right to liberty^ independence and a free life.The fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly comes at a time when the international economic situation is beset by crucial problems. In spite of scattered signs of improvement in certain industrial countries  fears are still widespread that tho current recession may lead to further deterioration in the economic field  and may seriously damage the economies of developing countries.The fact that the present economic situation has dragged on for so long demonstrates that the crisis is not just a temporary cyclical phenomenon  but the outcome of deep-rooted imbalances  of maladjustment in the economic structure and of the absence of justice in international economic relations.The current economic crisis and its negative consequences have also brought about the collapse of traditional methods of co-operation in the field of development. Successive international conferences have either failed completely or produced only disappointing results. Plans to resume global negotiations remain at a Estill  and efforts to halt further deterioration in international trade have not made much progress. In addition to all this  there has emerged a growing tendency to break up the general international consensus on development.Iraq reaffirms its total commitment to global negotiations in accordance with General Assembly resolution 34/138. Iraq also wishes to express its conviction that global negotiations still represents the most comprehensive method for the international community to restructure international economic relations  develop the economies of developing countries and strengthen multilateral economic co-operation.We hope sincerely that as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we will succeed in finding the opportunity to achieve real progress in this field.With regard to the critical economic situation confronting developing countries  Iraq wishes to voice its deep concern about the gravity of the problem in Africa  where economic deterioration is caused both by difficulties in the international economic situation and by continual droughts  desertification and other natural disasters on that continent.We welcome all practical and effective measures adopted arid implemented by the international community in support of short-term and long-term efforts by the African countries to deal with their own crises.We would also like to express our concern about the growing burden of foreign debts shouldered by the developing countries. These debts ought to be seen in the light of their detrimental effects on the economies of these countries.Finally  Iraq supports all international proposals urging the developed creditor countries and international financial and monetary institutions to enter into direct negotiations with developing countries  with a view to reaching a fair and permanent solution to the foreign debt problem  and thus perhaps enabling the debtor States to resume their development programs."
"61",3381,"ISL",40,1985,"Allow me to join my colleagues who have congratulated the President upon his election. I am convinced that his skills and wisdom  based not least on his long experience as an active participant in the work of the Organization  will greatly help him in his high office.I also wish to associate myself with those who have expressed their condolences to the Government and the people of Mexico on their great loss in the great disaster that has befallen their country. Iceland welcomes Brazil's proposal  and its acceptance  of an international relief effort through the United Nations system.The fortieth session is indeed a proper forum to take stock and to review past achievements as well as failures and shortcomings. We know that there are many who have been  and are  ready to criticize the Organization. The criticism has sometimes been unfair and unfounded  but unfortunately it has too often been justified. Constructive and positive criticism is always in order  and  indeed  necessary  because only with such criticism will improvements be made. In any statement at the thirty-ninth session I criticized  as have many others  the organization of work of the General Assembly  its working methods and its perpetual repetition of resolutions  some for decades  instead of earnestly seeking the solution of the problems they address. I therefore read with great attention the conclusions of 11 former Presidents of the Assembly  reflecting their views and proposals  as a result of their deliberation last June on the crisis of unilateralism as it affects the United Nations an improvement of the General Assembly.In my view our Organization could not have been given a more significant and useful anniversary present than the wise recommendations they have advanced. It only remains for us to adopt the improvements they have recommended to us.I am not one of those who maintain the view that the Charter of the United Nations is basically at fault and-requires drastic revision and amendments. I consider the Charter a remarkable document - in fact  a milestone in the history of human progress.The problem is not the imperfections of the Charter but the lack of political will to implement its provisions fully.It is believed that history is apt to repeat itself. The role of the United Nations - our role - is to prevent undesirable things from repeating themselves in relations between States in so far as this is humanly possible. The success of our efforts will in large degree depend on the approach we adopt: whether we approach the unsolved problems with some flexibility in a spirit of conciliation or whether we enter on or continue along a dead-end course.All our peoples have at one point or another been faced with crises or critical situations. Trying to master them is of course most important  but almost equally important is to grasp the lessons that such ordeals can teach those who are ready to learn. We can no doubt learn much from each other's experience.Almost a thousand years ago a civil war was about to break out in my country during a parliamentary session between those who wanted the nation to keep its faith in the old heathen gods and those who advocated Christianity. This was certainly one of the most critical moments in the entire history of my people. The matter was referred for arbitration to one of the wisest of the chieftains. After due reflection he delivered his verdict in what is the earliest parliamentary speech on record in my country. This speech of a thousand years ago is brief  and its brevity could serve as an example to us who address this Assembly. For the lasting wisdom it contains  however  allow me to share with the Assembly the account of this memorable speech:"" [He] said that he thought the state of the nation to have come to a sorry pass if people did not all keep one law in this land... and that it would lead to such discord  surely to be expected  that fighting would take place amongst the people such as would destroy the land ... and now I think it wise that we should not let those rule who most want to contend  but should mediate so between them that each keeps something of his cause  and we should all keep one law and one faith. It will prove true that as we sunder the law  so shall we sunder the peace.""He  who was himself a heathen  then declared that all men should be Christians. Those who had adhered to the old faith were permitted to continue certain religious practices but only on the condition that they did so in complete privacy  with no witnesses present - thus spelling the gradual dying out of the heathen faith.The speech speaks for itself and requires no comment or explanation on my part. Let me only stress that  while urging the States Members of the United Nations to refrain from the use of armed force and to seek a solution of their internal as well as external differences through conciliation and compromise  it is imperative that we do not lose sight of any of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.There are many burning world issues to be dealt with at this Assembly  some of which  hopefully  will be brought closer to being resolved.The Preamble to our Charter states that the United Nations was founded ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.""However  according to the most recent statistics published by the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs  20 million people have been killed in some 150 wars during the 40 years of the existence of the United Nations -3 million more lives lost than in the Second World War.It is worth considering that  throughout this period  Western Europe and North America have enjoyed peace  and the thought is prevalent to credit this to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  which was established in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.Has not the time come for us to do something effective to halt and prevent all armed conflicts  which are so costly in human lives and cause such infinite misery?Has not the time come to take full advantage of the provisions of the Charter and thus make the Security Council the true and effective guardian of international peace  as the founding fathers intended?Has not the time come for us to strengthen the Secretary-General's role in this field and help him develop early-warning procedures to tackle world crises before they unfold?It is indeed timely. And in this connection permit me once again to draw members' attention to the proposals of the five Nordic Foreign Ministers dealing with exactly this subject which were introduced in the Security Council and the General Assembly two years ago.Respect for international law and order can be strengthened and parties to disputes made to abide by resolutions of the Security Council only if the Member States stand united behind the Secretary-General and the Organization in their efforts to bring this about.Article 26 of the Charter gives the Security Council a leading role in the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments. The Council has been unable to achieve this goal. However  arms limitations and disarmament have beenamong the main topics of the General Assembly. The arms race began in the early years of the United Nations. Many sensible resolutions have been adopted by the Assembly during all these years but  contrary to our earnest hopes  the pace of the arms race has increased in equal proportion to the growing number of resolutions on disarmament and arms limitation adopted each year by the General Assembly. I think we should take the advice of the 11 former Presidents of the General Assembly to reduce the number and length of these resolutions and concentrate our efforts on finding a consensus for their implementation.World military expenditures doubled between 1960 and 1983 to reach $800 billion that year and are estimated to exceed $1 000 billion this year  in 14 years  from 1968 to 1982  the international arms trade and transfers increased threefold. This illustrates the situation and the pace of the arms race.The arms race and the nuclear threat is of increasing concern to my people and the Althing  our Parliament  unanimously resolved at its last session that it was of the utmost urgency that the nations of the world  not least the nuclear Powers  conclude agreements on reciprocal and comprehensive disarmament  compliance with which would he subject to international control and verification.The two super-Powers have by far the greatest possibility of changing the present situation for the better. They have been at odds and unable to conclude a comprehensive agreement on the reduction of armaments  including nuclear arms. The whole world realizes that a nuclear war may mean total destruction  and the so-called conventional weapons have assumed a destructive power which makes agreements on their control almost equally important.We have asked ourselves time and again: why then have the leading Powers been unable to come to any decisive agreement as it seems to be of such great benefit and advantage for both of them and  indeed  for the whole of mankind?Whenever there have been some breakthroughs  however limited  in this field  high hopes have been raised in the international community. They were regarded as a conciliation between the super-Powers and the first steps towards general and complete disarmament. Unfortunately that has not been the case.But why have the efforts to establish arms control and disarmament been so fruitless? Why were the agreements obtained so imperfect and limited? In my opinion  it is mainly due to the fact that the Soviet Union has not agreed to an effective and mutual verification system.Verification is a focal point in debates here in this Assembly on disarmament measures. It is generally recognized by experts in this field that there is little if any hope for progress in disarmament negotiations  if an effective system of verification is not an integral part of any agreement the parties are trying to reach. I believe that united Nations experts in disarmament affairs and our Secretary-General share this opinion.In a speech which the Secretary-General delivered at Harvard University on 9 January this year he said  inter alia  that the achievement of future disarmament agreements might be made easier if cognizance is taken of the largely unexploited capacity of the United Nations to serve as an objective monitor of compliance. And in this speech he says further:""Suggestions have been made for a United Nations Satellite Agency  for seismic stations and for a system of air observations to verify compliance with disarmament undertakings. Given the vital importance of verification to disarmament  the capacity of the United Nations to provide this service  if only in limited circumstances  could constitute a most valuable asset in future disarmament negotiations.""In view of these roost pertinent remarks of the Secretary-General  I hope that the Assembly will  as a mark of increasing  realism  in dealing with these vital questions  take good care that resolutions adopted do not lack adequate provisions calling for effective verification.I am unable to explain why the Soviet Union has not up to now been able to agree to effective verification procedures  but I certainly hope that in the negotiations now taking place in Geneva they will recognize the necessity for verification. And indeed I hope that when the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union meet in Geneva in November they will succeed in reaching a mutual understanding on this vital point and thereby make significant progress concerning the limitation of nuclear armaments.The Icelandic people - an island nation - depend for their existence almost exclusively on the living resources of the sea. We are therefore obviously deeply concerned over the increase in the build-up of naval arms. It was with this in mind that we co-sponsored General Assembly resolutions for the purpose of carrying out a comprehensive study on naval forces and naval arms systems.A group of governmental experts under the able Chairmanship of Ambassador Alatas of Indonesia has now adopted by consensus and submitted an interesting study on these complex issues. The study underlines vividly the difficult task of making the necessary arrangements to increase mutual trust in order to halt and reverse the naval arms race. The main aim of these efforts is to facilitate the identification of possible areas for disarmament and confidence building measures in the naval field. The different needs of nations for naval forces to ensure their security in accordance with the united Nations Charter must  of course  be taken into account  as well as the implications for international security. Equal and undiminished security for all states at the lowest practical level of armaments is what we are striving for.Another issue now in the foreground is the odious racial policy of apartheid so brutally pursued by the Government of South Africa.On this issue  the policy of ray Government  indeed of all the Nordic countries  is well known to this Assembly. The five Nordic countries have since 1978 followed a joint program of action against the inhuman  cruel and archaic policy of apartheid. Such action programs have also been adopted by other countries and will add to the growing pressure which we hope that sooner rather than later will lead the Government of South Africa to abandon the system of apartheid.When directing our efforts towards South Africa  let us not  however  forget the gross injustices in many other countries of the world  improvements must certainly also take place wherever else injustice now reigns.I want to pledge the support of my Government and the Icelandic people to the work and the efforts constantly being made within the framework of the united Nations to further and enhance human rights everywhere in the world. Human rights  democracy and freedom are closely linked and are the prerequisite for a lasting world peace.Through the universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Covenants it has become possible to internationalize action to promote human rights. Violations of human rights are no longer a purely national internal affair as they were considered to be. A vast majority of States is now committed to respecting the human rights conventions.People in some countries where their fellow citizens are still  for political reasons  being killed  imprisoned or taken to lunatic asylums  denied the freedom of travel  dispossessed or deprived of basic human rights  may feel that these conventions are just a piece of paper and nothing more. We certainly understand their despair. The international community  having the right to observe national situations and to react to violations of human rights  should indeed do so wherever these occur.It is among the fundamental principles of our Charter that both individual human beings and States have the right to self-determination. All States  in particular those still in the molding process  need the right to choose independently their form of government. And they must have the right to decide for themselves who they want as partners in co-operation  and should never be forced by more powerful States into collaboration they do not want. Cases in point are the brutal military invasions of foreign Powers in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.The success of the North-South dialog in terms of a sensible solution is indeed vital to human rights and welfare. Free trade is in my view a requisite of such a solution.With regard to the critical economic situation in Africa  I welcome the fact that a consensus was reached in the Economic and Social Council this summer on a resolution on this subject. Although concessional flows are important  relaxation of trade restrictions and improved trading terms  including better prices for goods from the developing countries  as well as a shift in agricultural policies  are of no less importance in redressing the situation.Coming from a country heavily dependent on foreign trade  I am deeply concerned over the increasing protectionist pressures apparent in many countries. We must resist the temptation to give way to these pressures  for experience has taught us that in the end everyone will lose. The maintenance and expansion of free trade within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is especially important now  in view of the delicate situation of the world economy  and in my opinion a new round of multilateral trade negotiations should be undertaken as soon as possible.Iceland has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and we are among those who believe that this is one of the most important international conventions ever concluded  and a constructive proof of a great united Nations accomplishment in the interest of all mankind.In this important field we must all have one law and therefore we strongly urge all United Nations Member states who have not already done so to ratify or accede to this Convention at their earliest convenience.The United Nations initiated the Decade for Women which is now nearing its end. In Iceland the Decade began with wide publicity surrounding a work stoppage on United Nations Day  24 October  in 1.975  the International Women's Year - when Icelandic women took a day off from paid and unpaid work in order to let their contribution to society be clearly felt  realized and appreciated.This important United Nations initiative has had specific legal results in Iceland and has encouraged the development of a greater role for Icelandic women in their society. The successful outcome of the Nairobi Conference was an important achievement in international co-operation  when nearly 160 nations agreed on matters concerning women's welfare in general  and their right to a better life. It is our firm hope and belief that the results of the United Nations Decade for Women will continue to lead to irreversible improvements in the lot of women in all parts of the world.The United Nations has dedicated this year to the youth of the world. Youth is the future. Let us hope that the preamble of our Charter will become a reality for those who are young now and that they will inherit from us a better international situation and a closer and more dynamic co-operation among the peoples of the Earth than we have ever enjoyed.Let us pledge that we will do our utmost to make the dream come true  that the young generation in the world today will enjoy a happier and more fulfilling life than any generation before  breaking neither the law nor the peace."
"62",3428,"ISR",40,1985,"Sir  at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for the fortieth session. I am convinced that your wealth of diplomatic experience and proven skills will contribute to the enrichment of the deliberations during this special session.This year we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  which was established with many hopes and expectations in the aftermath of a world distraught by death  destruction and the plunder of war.Like many other peoples  but significantly different from them  the Jewish people underwent an ordeal which will leave its eternal mark not only in the long annals of its history but also in its deeper spiritual and psychological experience. This was  of course  the horrendous Holocaust which was wrought upon us by nazism and anti-semitism. For this reason the emergence of the United Nations provided a source of inspiration and light for us at the end of a very dark era in our history.Indeed  what could be more stirring than the unequivocal declarations of principle appearing in the opening paragraphs of the United Nations Charter  such as: ""We the peoples of the United Nations  determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and the call ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors""? To my great regret  however  this Organization has had a part in shattering these aspirations and noble ideals.The slander of anti-semitism has also been propagated in the guise of anti-zionism. In this context  we sadly note the tenth anniversary of the passing of the infamous General Assembly resolution falsely equating the Jewish National Liberation Movement - Zionism - with an outrageous phenomenon totally alien to the most fundamental and spiritual values of the Jewish heritage. That resolution  3379 (XXX)  of 10 November 1975  will be remembered in the history of the United Nations as a terrible blot on its record and a discredit to the Organization and to those irresponsible Members that supported it.Other international forums have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda and political warfare against Israel  distorting the real purposes for which they were established. It would  therefore  be appropriate and timely to strive for what I would call ""political disarmament"" in these bodies  in order to guarantee that they maintain their integrity and credibility in the exercise of their legitimate functions.Israel was established in 1948 against the background of a United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The United Nations  however  did nothing to implement its resolution  and the State of Israel came into being through the will  the toil and the sacrifice of its people. Nor  I might add  did the United Nations alleviate the immense threats and dangers that Israel had to face since its establishment.Since the founding of the State we have made every possible effort towards the achievement of peace and the normalization of relations with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our national heritage. The Jewish people is a small  democratic and free people  striving to rebuild its renewed nationhood in its ancient homeland. We cherish peace and we teach its blessings to our children. Indeed  after a prolonged period of strife and hostility forced on us by our neighbors  we found a way to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.Egypt and Israel have demonstrated clearly that face-to-face negotiations and direct dialog are the most constructive and beneficial ways of achieving peace. This was brought about on the basis of the Camp David Accords  which established a just and effective framework for the settlement of conflicts. It is for this reason that Israel is so insistent on applying this framework to the further extension of the peace process. We hope that in the near future we shall be able to negotiate with Jordan  our neighbor to the East. It is crucial that the peace treaty with Egypt should not remain the sole example of peace with our neighbors  and therefore we earnestly seek to widen and deepen that peace by extending the process to include the rest of our Arab neighbors.From this rostrum I once again urge King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct negotiations with Israel - not in some vague  deflecting international forum  but in direct  bilateral discussions. An international conference is a means of evading direct negotiations. It will be a stage for hostile and extreme propaganda and will not serve the cause of peace. Our aim should be the achievement of a bilaterally negotiated peace treaty between our countries. There is no change in our deep commitment to the Camp David accords  and we stand ready therefore to meet a Jordanian delegation  which may include Arab Palestinians from Judea  Samaria and Gaza  or other Arab Palestinians to be mutually agreed upon.Israel firmly believes that there is no way to solve the problems of our region except through negotiations and peace. If King Hussein has finally decided to offer his hand in peace  let him act the way the late President Sadat did. He should not drown the quest for peace in a sea of conditions that nullify any chance of peace - conditions such as an international conference and the participation of terrorist organizations in the peace process. I should also like to urge King Hussein to free himself at this eleventh hour  from the clutches of the PLO. King Hussein has been caught in their clutches before and it seems that he has failed to learn from his own experience. Only after freeing himself from his dangerous association with the PLO terrorists will it be possible to achieve progress towards peace between Israel and Jordan. Indeed  the recent marked increase in terror attacks against Israelis stems  among other things  from Hussein's partnership with the PLO. Jordan cannot extend the olive branch of peace on the one hand and play host to terror at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.Our position in this regard is clear and decisive. We are firmly against any contacts or dealings with terrorists or their representatives - and  in this case  with an organization whose declared purpose is the liquidation of Israel. PLO leaders have been intimating that they are engaged in the political process of peace. However  they have been waging cruel and murderous terrorist activity all along. According to their declared program  political action and terrorist activities should go hand in hand until they achieve their goal  the elimination of Israel. He are not ready to negotiate with terror. There is no place for its self-proclaimed representatives at a table where peace  security and tranquility are to be negotiated. Acknowledging that organization would be tantamount to legitimizing terror  and should be rejected by all those who value peace.To protect our people and territory from terror  we were obliged to act against the PLO terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon  which posed an intolerable threat to our people in the Galilee region.Meanwhile  terror continues to wreak havoc in Lebanon. The latest outrage was the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats in Beirut. Kidnapping and the holding of hostages for ransom is only one of the manifestations of international terrorism  whose linchpin is the PLO  which we roust fight and stamp out. This is another example of the fact that terror knows no bounds  neither political nor any other.The removal of the various threats from Israel's northern border continues to be an important priority for us. We will do all in our power to defend and protect the population of the north. This objective has become no less important in the wake of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanon  in accordance with the decision of the Government of Israel of 14 January 1935.Yesterday Israel took action against terror bases  this time in Tunisia. Israel's air force acted against the terrorists only after it became evident that the terrorists were mounting attacks from Tunis with impunity. Only last week  PLO terrorists  who were directed and commanded from Tunis  attacked an Israeli boat in Larnaca  Cyprus  and murdered three Israeli civilians in cold blood. In recent months  those headquarters were responsible for a number of seaborne attemptsagainst our people  which were prevented by Israel's navy. We had no intention of attacking Tunisia  although that country has permitted terrorist bases to exist on its soil. We acted against murderous criminals in order to prevent the continuation of their criminal acts.The United Nations has been sadly remiss in meeting the challenge of international and PLO terror. It could and should have come out resolutely against this evil phenomenon of our time and placed it outside the pale of civilization. Instead  it has equivocated and  worse  legitimized terror in terms that have provided encouragement to the terrorists and their supporters.I regret to state that  in spite of numerous outrages and continuing attacks by PLO terrorists  this issue has never been seriously addressed by the Security Council or other United Nations and international forums. Israel cannot be expected to ignore this double standard. In spite of this  Israel is willing to act with other free nations to curb  if not stamp out  terrorism. Similarly  we urge joint international action against terrorists and their sponsors.Among the most distressing and oppressing phenomena of our international experience is racism. The very word evokes dark and brutal memories of the long history of the Jewish people. Apartheid is a system of discrimination which the Jewish faith and the State of Israel totally reject and repudiate. The Government of Israel  on 11 August 1985  reiterated that it is unconditionally opposed to the policy of apartheid in South Africa and to any discrimination on grounds of race  religion or color or on any other grounds.Israel has diplomatic relations with some of the African States and we are ready to renew our relations with those with which we do not have them. This is  of course  up to them. We believe that many have by now seen who the real friends of Africa are: it is not those who use high-flown words but will not lend a helping hand in time of need and distress  or those who remember Africa only when they need its votes at the United Nations. The State of Israel  in contrast  was one of the first to reach out to the nations of Africa  in their early years of sovereignty and statehood and in their current travails  and we are ready to increase our efforts.In the area of disarmament the nations of the Middle Bast are confronted with three main challenges. These are the reduction of conventional arms  the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the eradication of the use. of chemical warfare. My Government believes that concerted regional action on all three issues is a moral imperative of the highest priority.Concerning the accumulation of conventional arras  Israel voices its concern over the accelerated supply of large quantities of weapons to a number of belligerent Arab Governments in our region. These regimes do not need these arms for their defense  but are stockpiling them to use against Israel. This can only serve to undermine the chances for peace in the Middle East.On the subject of nuclear weapons  we believe that the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation in so sensitive an area as the Middle Bast is a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone  based on a system of obligations binding' on all States concerned. Israel stands ready to begin such negotiations without delay or preconditions.While Israel is conscious of the necessity to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons  we are also aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful use of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international agreements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.Another issue that arouses the deepest anxiety is the repeated use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and the danger that such use may spread in a manner that could not easily be reversed  if at all. It is tragic that the sixtieth anniversary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbidding the use of such weapons should be commemorated in this manner. This total disregard for solemn international legal obligations by Iraq demonstrates the difficulty of achieving genuine disarmament. But we must not despair; we must continue our efforts in this vital field of human endeavor.The deteriorating situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union obliges us once again to speak out in defense of their elementary rights. Our concern relates especially to the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who have indicated their desire to join their people in Israel. The Soviet authorities  however  in flagrant violation of the Helsinki Final Act and many other international obligations assumed by the Soviet Government  refuse them permission to leave.Many of those Jews who have been denied permission to leave are forced to live as outcasts from Soviet society  subject to all manner of official harassment and persecution  while being effectively deprived of the means of legal redress. Increasing numbers have been engulfed in recent months in an accelerating wave of arrests  trials and savage sentences of imprisonment on trumped-up criminal charges. Jews seeking to disseminate knowledge of the Hebrew language have been prominent among these recent victims of judicial repression. These Jews are in no way violating Soviet law  nor are they involved in any form of anti-Soviet activity. Their real crimes  in the eyes of the authorities  are their persistent demand to leave for Israel and their efforts  in the face of strenuous official opposition  to perpetuate their Jewish heritage  culture and religion.All of these outrages are taking place against the background of a relentless campaign of anti-semitic incitement  usually camouflaged as anti-zionism  in the officially controlled media - a campaign designed by the authorities to encourage an attitude of suspicion  hatred and contempt towards Soviet Jews on the part of the Soviet population.We call upon all persons of goodwill and all Governments in the civilized world to join us in our protests and in urging the Soviet authorities to conform their policies towards Soviet Jewry to the international obligations solemnly undertaken by the Soviet Government.Israel seeks good relations with all States including  naturally  the Soviet Union. We have looked to the new Soviet leadership for signs of change in its attitude towards Soviet Jewry. Regrettably  so far we have seen no positive changes whatsoever. .We therefore have no choice but to continue to expose energetically and protest vigorously these flagrant violations of the rights of our fellow Jews seeking to join their people in Israel. He shall continue to do so untiA every Soviet Jew who so wishes is free to exercise this basic right.There is also the problem of the Jews of Syria  who are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies and are not free to choose to live wherever they wish. This is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  of which Syria is a signatory. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return.Several hundred young Jewish women remain unmarried because of the depleted male Jewish population in Syria. The Syrian Government has cruelly refused to allow those women to leave the country in order to be able to marry within their faith and establish families.tJe are also concerned about the small  ancient Jewish community left in Ethiopia  because of its isolation and suffering and the latest disasters that have befallen that country. Some of these Jews have already returned to their historic homeland and have been received as long-lost brothers and sisters who have finally returned home.The people of Israel and its Government have expressed their solidarity with the Ethiopian people  which has undergone much suffering as a result of the recent famine and other difficulties. We appeal to the Ethiopian Government to respect the cultural and religious rights of the Jewish community and to enable it to continue to maintain its heritage and religion and  on humanitarian grounds  to permit those among them who so desire to be reunited with their families in Israel.The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations may be a fitting occasion for a review and reappraisal of its activities  in frank and constructive self-criticism.The United Nations should not merely celebrate its past but also plan for its future.Some may feel disheartened by the fact that  after so many years of United Nations preoccupation with the problems of the developing countries  we still remain so distant from the goal of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich nations of the world. Poverty  hunger  malnutrition and disease still characterize the conditions of life in many parts of the world.One inescapable conclusion is that progress has too often been hampered by a tendency to substitute slogans for serious plans of action. Meeting the world's pressing economic and social problems will require new dimensions of international co-operation. The danger of famine continues to afflict developing countries. There is dire need for urgent action by the world community. The peoples of Africa are struggling to free themselves from the curses of poverty and hunger  and the rest of the world must help them in this struggle.The vital element of developing traditional agriculture has been sorely neglected. Israel is now preparing an aid proposal for more efficient food delivery systems that would provide better nutrition and would link such aid with land and water development programs.The success of integrated rural development has been proved in Israel's own rapid agricultural development. Israel has much experience in the proper use of soil and water  marketing organization  agro-industrial systems appropriate for developing countries  and the integration of populations and development projects. He are ready to share our know-how in these fields with other developing countries. The benefits of this experience can contribute to raising living standards in many societies.	4Israel has presented to international organizations  both within and outside the United Nations  a development proposal entitled ""Transitional Economy"". It seeks to break the vicious circle of poverty by improving the productivity and quality of life in developing countries. The proposed program seeks to combine a comprehensive development process with decentralized planning and implementation.In the 26 years of Israel's involvement in international development efforts  Israel has co-operated with more than 100 countries and trained over 50 000 men and women in agriculture  in rural development and in health and education. During Israel's development it encountered some of the same problems that are now facing African countries and has successfully overcome them.The United Nations may recapture some of its prestige and authority if it gives priority to these pressing social and economic issues. The magnitude of the tasks before us will require unprecedented international co-operation.Unfortunately  the United Nations record is not very encouraging. At its last session the General Assembly had 143 items on its agenda. It passed no less than 38 resolutions relating to the Middle East  out of which 37 were negative  even hostile  in their reference to Israel. Such resolutions have long ceased to attract any attention or carry any weight. Yet the General Assembly did not see fit to address itself to such danger-spots as the Iraq-Iran war and Afghanistan  or to many of the socio-economic problems which plague our society.Let us put aside the political differences that beset our world and join forces in an effort to find solutions for the ordinary man  woman and child  who are too often ignored in the heat of political debate. Let us work together in the spirit of the ancient prophets who gave to the world the concept of the brotherhood of man  a concept which has been the basis for the great ideals of mankind.In the present age of unprecedented opportunities  Israel calls upon all Governments  international agencies and non-governmental organizations to rise to the challenge offered by science and technology. Let us share the fruits of scientific and technological advances to improve our lives. Let us build a moral and prosperous future to achieve justice and dignity for all. Let the United Nations become  truly  a ""United Nations for a better world""."
"63",3475,"ITA",40,1985,"First  I should like to extend to you. Sir  my delegation's most sincere and heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. You represent a country which is linked to Italy by traditional and ancient ties and by a common Latin and Christian background. You are also the representative of a country which  next January  is to join the European Community.We wish also to convey our thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for the intelligent work he has accomplished and for the efficiency and loyalty with which he has upheld the principles and values of the United Nations during the many crises that have troubled! the community of States.In these days our thoughts turn to the great friendly country of Mexico  so terribly stricken by natural disaster. The news and pictures we receive daily from that country fill our hearts with sadness. We respectfully bow our heads in remembrance for the dead and we share the sorrow of the many bereaved families so harshly affected by the calamity. From this rostrum I should like to express our feelings of friendship and sympathy to the Mexican people and let them know that we are ready to contribute to the relief work undertaken by its Government.At the moment we are all witnessing an intense and eventful period of great significance and also of radical change. Our societies are changing internally  and the international situation is also changing as a result of the creation and consolidation of new States. These changes have become even greater as we confront new and complex needs that cannot be fulfilled at either the national or the regional level.It is precisely because we are passing through such a turbulent period and because we are bound together by increasingly close ties of interdependence that we feel we must stress how closely the theme of international solidarity and co-operation is linked with the strengthening of multilateral machinery. Only in that way can we ensure the participation of all States in the decisions that will determine the maintenance of peace  the protection of human rights and the economic and political growth of peoples.There is  no doubt  a risk that our system may become cumbersome if we maintain the pluralistic approach that is not only desirable but that represents the practical outcome of our observance of the principle of universality proclaimed in the Charter of the united Nations. Pluralism thus involves a risk that we must face  but one that we roust not allow to dictate our conduct. Indeed  it seems important to me that the major multilateral forums must adopt a long-term strategy in this regard: they must learn to look to the future  to overcome immediate difficulties and to uphold  beyond ideological confrontations and tensions  all those factors that can serve to unite rather than divide the members of the community of nations.That is why our appeal for solidarity and co-operation is more than a need; it has become an essential and basic strategy against which all countries must measure their actions.In light of the great challenges of our era  we must come up with co-ordinated responses in which the contribution of the United Nations is decisive. I shall cite a few examples. Italy was particularly appreciative of the action taken by the United Nations to alleviate the consequences of the famine that recently faced so many countries in Africa. The work done by the Office for Emergency Operations  to which the Secretary-General assigned one of his most qualified colleagues  is and continues to be particularly effective in such important sectors as transport  food aid distribution  rural development and water supply. Many Governments  including the Italian Government  have also taken part in this work  and their efforts in this area have been extraordinary.The problem of drug control  in my opinion  constitutes a proving ground in which the United Nations must show that it can deal effectively with one of the greatest evils of contemporary society. The work being done in Vienna by the competent organization:* has yielded very positive results. The spread of drugs is a global assault on the basic interests of humanity and  above all  on the integrity and stability of society. Our defenses against this scourge must therefore be global in nature. In this connection we welcome with satisfaction the Secretary-General's proposal to convene a world conference on the drug problem. The Italian Government warmly supports that proposal.Our appeal for solidarity and international co-operation must be linked with a reaffirmation of the need for all States Members of the Organization to share in economic and social well-being. With that goal in mind  we will continue to work towards a concept of international commerce based on free trade  a concept that  in the past 40 years  has been an essential factor for growth in the world economy.If we are to achieve a more equitable distribution of world resources to increase general well-being and reduce the existing imbalances in standards of living  we must also ensure a more careful utilization of those resources. They must not be wasted  especially by the poorer countries.In this connection as well  Italy would like to repeat an idea that it put forward some years ago in this same forum. It seems to us important that agreement be reached on the establishment of a control mechanism that can ensure that trade in conventional weapons be completely open and visible.Throughout its history the Republic of Italy has demonstrated its belief in the principles and values of the United Nations. That faith in those principles and values reflects  above all  a conviction that is deeply rooted in the minds of our people. Our commitment to the Organization reflects our response to the objective requirements inherent in Italy's geographical position and history at the crossroads of three continents. That crossroads is situated in a geopolitically sensitive region where the fruitful coexistence of different civilizations and cultures is often accompanied by acute tensions.In the light of such complex realities  in which balances seem precarious and fragile  Italy has made certain fundamental choices in the post-war period. Those choices are reflected  on the one hand  in the Atlantic Alliance and in Italy's friendship with the United States and  on the other hand  in its participation in the process of European integration  both political and economic.These choices  besides being still valid today  are in line with the ideals and the objectives of the United Nations. They allow Italy to make a contribution to peace  fulfilling the security conditions necessary for carrying forward successfully the process of dStente  in which we firmly believe.We have always understood our participation in the European Community not only as a means of consolidating our internal well-being but also and above all as a means of overcoming  through regional solidarity  the dangerous destabilizing factors which are to be found on the European continent and  more generally  on the international scene. We consider that the close ties of association linking the Community with many countries on all continents are an important contribution to stability.The Charter of the United Nations mentions and indeed proclaims the role of the regional organizations in helping to create an atmosphere of stability and in ensuring a more ordered development of relations among States. The European Community is pursuing these objectives  whose validity is confirmed by the force of attraction exercised by the Community itself on other European countries. We have recently seen a good example of this force of attraction in the decisions by Spain and Portugal to join the Community. The Italian Government has not spared its efforts  particularly during the first half of this year  to achieve that welcome result.Social and human concerns form an integral and essential part of the international actions undertaken by Italy and indeed by the other members of the European Community. This approach is derived from our conviction that any equilibrium not based on respect for the dignity and fundamental freedoms of men and women carries within itself the germs of destruction and therefore is destined to last for only a brief period of time.For these reasons Italy participated in the recent mission to South Africa carried out by three Foreign Ministers of countries belonging to the European Community. The dual aim of the mission was to bring home to the Pretoria Government the Ten's agreed position and its strong condemnation of apartheid and also to make contact with eminent individuals not belonging to the Government of South Africa.The elimination of the intolerable system of apartheid and the full enjoyment of legitimate political and civil rights by all members of the South African population are becoming more and more urgent. The action taken by the European Community has not ended with the completion of that mission. The Community follows the events in South Africa with constant concern. This concern is an aspect of the signals that we have so far sent to promote a change of the situation in South Africa.We are also concerned about the delays in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We feel that it should be fully implemented so that Namibia may achieve rapid and unconditional independence.This year we are beginning our discussions in an atmosphere of fervent hope. The renewal of dialog at the highest level between the United States and the Soviet union opens up the prospect of an essential movement towards the general lowering of tension and therefore towards the resumption of detente.The Italian Government has welcomed with satisfaction the decision by the United States and Soviet Governments to begin global negotiations on nuclear and space weapons. We have seen in that decision the glimmer of a hope that there will be a reduction of armaments to the lowest possible level.The world community must be freed from the threat of a never-ending accumulation of military arsenals. The problem of disarmament is certainly a general problem  and both global and regional.understandings must contribute to its solution. However  it is clear in this context that the major Powers should play their role in the definition of a new offense-defense relationship.Therefore we hope that the forthcoming summit meeting between the President of the United States of America and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will result in an understanding which will allow the disarmament negotiations to move forward constructively  although it must not be forgotten that detente is fostered also by attitudes which are not exclusively connected with the military sphere.The Disarmament Conference in Geneva constitutes another important stage in the strategy to achieve a general reduction in tension. As we all know  that Conference is seeking to eliminate another category of weapons of mass destruction  namely  chemical weapons.The Italian Government is striving and will continue to strive to achieve equitable solutions to the problems that are still pending in this forum. A complete and verifiable ban on chemical weapons should constitute for all countries  including those in possession of such weapons  a priority objective. It is for this reason that we express our disappointment at the slow progress at the Conference.It is our view that the existing channels of communication  whether formal or informal  are not enough in themselves to ensure a process which will lead to a more stable international equilibrium. These channels in any case do not allow the overcoming of distrust. In other words  we must spare no effort in the search for more suitable instruments for the achievement of positive results in international negotiations  particularly those relating to disarmament. For this reason we have long considered that we must multiply the opportunities of obtaining a better understanding of legitimate security needs.One channel of communication which  in our view  has so far not been sufficiently appreciated is that of the international scientific community. We should not forget that this community has an ancient tradition of universality and a natural vocation for co-operation  with these advantages  it constitutes a reference point and a means of support for political action designed to favor the bringing together of positions. There are  in this connection  encouraging examples  such as the Scientific Forum held in Hamburg in 1980. We should endorse the recommendation that another such meeting be held. Such a course of action is suggested by the important scientific developments which have taken place and by the fact that the simple exchange of information among scientists may help to overcome prejudices and to correct errors.in our view  the holding of a new conference may provide us with a starting point for considering machinery whereby we could associate the scientific world more closely with the search for peace and an effective understanding on the control and limitation of weapons. A message to that effect has reached us in recent years from scientists all over the world who  in their thousands  signed the Erice Appeal for ""Science Without Frontiers"".We feel that it will be difficult to achieve real progress in disarmament if States do not show a greater readiness than in the past to ensure the visibility of military activities. In this respect  the problem is certainly not to renounce the safeguarding of legitimate security interests. On the contrary  we must take note of the fact that technological progress and the increasing sophistication of weapons have created a need for visibility which did not exist in the past  precisely in order to safeguard vital security interests. In other words  I believe that we must now abandon the mental attitude of regarding measures of visibility and verification as secondary elements in disarmament agreements. Instead we must recognize  with a strong sense of realism  that  in view of technological developments  these measures must become  together with the balance of forces  the central and vital components of any understanding on the control and limitation of weapons.Aware of the need for increased international co-operation at all levels  Italy has made a significant contribution to the progress of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. There is no contradiction between the objectives set forth in the Final Act of Helsinki and those set forth in the Charter of the united Nations: they are complementary. I would like here to emphasize  in the light of the results obtained at that Conference  that recourse to these multilateral instruments of dialog does not exclude  but indeed promotes  a balanced and fruitful development of bilateral relations.The commitments we have assumed and those that we intend to assume at the Conference provide a basis for giving specific shape to the ideals of security  of respect for human rights  and of economic  scientific and cultural co-operation among States.In this context  may I point out that the cultural forum to be held at Budapest next month will provide us with a meeting place at which we can hold a positive exchange of views on particular subjects. We shall ensure that the basic feature of this forum - that of unfettered discussion  is constantly maintained. We shall do so in the conviction that the three fold terms of reference -creation  dissemination and co-operation in the field of culture - are parts of a process which is not meant to be a propaganda exercise but aims at mutual understanding. By its nature  culture is not a destabilizing factor and consequently knows no frontiers.We are also still concerned about the theme of economic and social development.We are on the eve of a great technological revolution destined to improve living standards and hence the well-being of the peoples of the world. I have said that the problem facing us is to enable all countries which are members of the international community to benefit from the results of this far-reaching peaceful revolution. Today we are engaged in the struggle to overcome hunger and to free as many peoples as possible from disease  epidemics and drought. However  we must ensure that the battle we are fighting today - and which we are determined to win - is not shifted tomorrow to other fields of combat  namely those in which the aim is to gain access to the results of technological progress. In other words  we must now ask ourselves how to prevent the emergence of other tensions once the tensions resulting from under-development have been overcome. This is an additional reason not to continue today to waste on the nuclear and conventional arms race an ever-increasing portion of those resources to which future generations will rightly demand access.Italy is aware of the consequences  including the long-term consequences  inherent in the relationship between disarmament and development  and we await with keen interest the conference to be held in Paris in July 1986 to consider ways and means of helping to reduce the need for weapons in different areas of the globe and thus to improve prospects for development.Before concluding  I would like to express our satisfaction at the successful conclusion of the work of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons. The non-proliferation regime represents one of the pillars of international stability and security. Italy is convinced that this regime should be strengthened and made universal. The fact that the Conference was able to reach agreement cm a final document attests to the determination of the international community to unite to halt and reverse both horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons.In the context of the world economy the problem of external indebtedness has now rightly been given priority in international discussions. My Government believes that this question should be approached realistically  bearing in mind the desire to achieve specific solutions. In that conviction  Italy gives strong support to the international organizations concerned. We also hope that a greaterspirit of solidarity can be given to the interventions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.If we approach this problem in a detached and rational frame of mind can we find appropriate solutions to free us from two difficult problems: on the one hand  an intolerable burden which can seriously affect chances for future development  and  on the other hand  the risks of bankruptcy which would disrupt the world economic system and dry up the sources of financing and credit  to the detriment of the weakest countries themselves.However great the progress made we are unfortunately still far from having worked out effective remedies in this field.Italy believes in multilateralism. In a world where the interests of individual countries or groups of countries finally prevail over the collective interests of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law - we maintain that we should heed the recommendations which emerge from the community of States within the United Nations.In this connection  our thoughts turn above all to the Middle East. The proposals that appear in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) continue to constitute the main basic reference point in the search for a lasting and hence valid solution.Our position on the Middle East remains based on the fundamental principles proclaimed on several occasions by the countries of the European Community: the right of all States in the region to exist in security and peace and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with all that the exercise of that right implies.We welcome the recent Jordanian-Palestinian agreement designed to establish the basis for a joint negotiating approach  even though it has not yet produced the hoped-for results. It brings closer together the positions of two of the main protagonists in the peace process and introduces an element of dynamism in that troubled region.Equally relevant  in our opinion  are the proposals put forward by Egypt which have led to a new phase of negotiation with Israel. In the context of the Middle East  the Italian Government believes that it is essential to associate Syria with the process of stabilization and peace in the region.In this same constructive spirit  we shall spare no effort to promote a return to normality in Lebanon with respect for its independence and territorial integrity.I would also like to point out that during this year Italy has increased its contribution in finance and men to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  which we consider a key element in the United Nations contribution to a peaceful settlement of one of the most serious disputes of modern times.In dealing with the problem of the Middle East I would like to say how distressed we are at the consequences for the civilian populations of the Iraq-Iran conflict. The reasons for this conflict seem to defy any logic but that of endless destruction. We must ask ourselves seriously whether the community of States should resign itself to being unable in any way to intervene to persuade the interested parties to adopt a cease-fire.In the Mediterranean region the Cyprus crisis unfortunately remains unresolved. We unreservedly support the activities of the Secretary-General and we address an urgent appeal to the parties concerned to give sincere and specific evidence of their will to negotiate.As part of our direct interest in the Mediterranean region  we are devoting close attention to our relations with Malta. We intend to develop these relations with full respect for the Maltese Government's position of neutrality and non-alignment  which Italy considers as a very positive element.Latin America  a region to which Italy looks with attention and interest  is playing an increasingly important role on the world stage. The processes whereby the bases of democracy are being restored on that continent are a clear indication of an advanced maturity which we can but welcome with strong approval.Unfortunately  shadowy areas still remain in Latin America. We therefore appreciate all the more certain signs of change  such as  for example  the understanding reached in Chile among the democratic forces  as a result of the initiative taken by Cardinal Primate Fresno  an initiative designed to pave the way for the transition to the full democracy we hope for. The Government and the armed forces of Chile must therefore respond constructively to that important development.Another source of concern is the political and socio-economic crisis that persists in Central America; even though in some countries of the region progress has been made in the process of restoring democracy.We fully understand the importance of stability in the Central American and Caribbean region for the maintenance of world peace. That is why we shall continue to support any initiative such as that taken by the Contadora Group designed to relieve tension and promote peace.Accordingly  at the meeting to be held next November in Luxembourg  we shall support the continuation of the dialog initiated last year in San Jose  Costa Rica  between the Ten countries of the European Community  Spain  Portugal  the countries of the Contadora Group and the five countries of Central America.In the Horn of Africa  a region with which Italy is especially linked by historical ties and by increasing co-operation  we shall continue to work for the settlement of outstanding disputes through negotiating processes based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Thanks to dialog and co-operation on subjects of common concern  it should be possible to achieve solutions based on respect for the territorial integrity of States within existing frontiers and on non-interference in internal affairs  with due regard for the historical and cultural identities of the peoples of the area. We hope that the same method of dialog and patient  courageous and constructive negotiations  designed to achieve solutions based on the principles of the United Nations  will be applied to the serious problems of the Asian continent.In this connection  we shall continue to follow closely the two serious crises which continue to plague the regions the Afghan and Cambodian crises.In Afghanistan the clearly formulated suggestions of the General Assembly have not yet been acted upon and the country is still suffering from the ravages of war.Another question which concerns us is the tension on the Pakistan frontiers  in particular as a result of bombardments which have caused many civilian victims among Pakistani peoples of that region. Italy deems it essential that a determined effort should be made to resolve that question and renews its appeal to the parties concerned to adopt a constructive approach at the Geneva negotiations.As regards Cambodia  Italy once again wishes to renew its strong appeal for the restitution of international law that has been violated. We urge the parties concerned seriously and specifically to start negotiations that can lead to solutions which bring freedom  justice and peace to all the Cambodian people.Concerning Korea  Italy takes a positive view of the resumption of direct talks between Seoul and Pyongyang on economic and humanitarian subjects. We hope that these talks will be gradually extended to other sectors  such as the question of sport  in view of the coming Olympic games at Seoul  which must be free from all political constraints. This will undoubtedly help to create a lasting atmosphere of detente in that peninsula  thus increasing the prospects for its reunification. With this aim in mind  we favor the admission of the two Koreas to this Organization - thus filling an unreasonable gap.The Charter of the United Nations  whose fortieth anniversary we are celebrating this year  provides means  if we want to use them  which could respond adequately to the needs of peoples exposed to sudden change.Aware that the destinies of nations  both large and small  are closely linked  the United Nations has become a unique forum for meetings  discussions and co-operation. Within the context of this evolution towards pluralism  which we see to be highly positive  disputes and conflicts still exist  of course. Such conflicts  even though they may be of a circumscribed and sectoral nature  could end up becoming - as a result of this phenomenon of general interdependence - universal events which bear the seeds of danger for mankind as a whole.This is why  on the eve of a new year  which we intend to dedicate to peace  it seems to me extremely appropriate to reflect on the manner in which this Organization could play an even greater role as a forum which can foreshadow and anticipate events so as to direct them towards an ordered and harmonious coexistence between people and nations.The Italian Government will make its contribution to this end because we are convinced that peace is indivisible and is won day by day through sacrifices and concessions  without ever slackening our attention or yielding to the temptation of adopting easy solutions."
"64",3521,"JAM",40,1985,"On behalf of the delegation of Jamaica  I take the opportunity to extend warm congratulations to you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. It is altogether fitting that in this important anniversary year of the United Nations the General Assembly should have presiding over its deliberations a veteran diplomat of your caliber who has over many years given such distinguished service at the United Nations.I take the opportunity also to express our gratitude to your predecessor. Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  for his outstanding presidency during the thirty-ninth session.In the past year there has been a mix of events which have brought both despair and glimmers of hope. In the course of history  some years bear the stamp of some dominating event or series of events for which they remain memorable. I fear that the past year may be remembered as a notable year for the number and scale of disasters which have struck in different places and different forms. We recall with sadness the drought and famine in Africa  the Bhopal disaster  a number of airline and train crashes  and last month's tragic earthquakes in Mexico City  all of which meant suffering  death and devastation. They all demonstrate how fragile is the human condition and the extent to which we are all susceptible to shattering blows by natural calamity or malfunctioning technology. It should not be overlooked that it is adversity of this kind which often emphasizes the common bond of humanity that unites us and places in true perspective the barriers dividing us. we have seen this reflected in the generous outpouring of verbal and material expressions of sympathy  solidarity and support from the world at large to the people of each afflicted nation. Jamaica once again expresses its sympathy to the Governments and peoples affected. The United Nations has been involved in disaster relief through the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator (UNDRO)  but recent experience has illustrated the great importance of readiness and efficient emergency services  as well as overall co-ordination  in relief efforts. We believe that this is an area in which international co-operation can be expanded  and we urge that consideration be given to the strengthening of United Nations capabilities in this field.On the broader scene  the international situation is still charged with tension and uncertainty  although some developments during the past year have generated some optimism. We have been encouraged by the resumption of dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union  the resumption of bilateral arms control negotiations  and the agreement for a summit meeting between the leaders ofthose two countries in Geneva next month. We consider it an important opportunityfor establishing greater understanding and more stable relations. There is much at stake in this meeting affecting the general atmosphere in international affairs and the outlook for the future. We hope for a constructive approach and a constructive spirit from both sides  so that the results may pave the way for a new era in East-West relations.It could also give an impetus to progress in arms control and disarmament in which achievements have so far been meager. The continued proliferation of nuclear weapons increases the ever-present danger to our very existence. Jamaica reiterates its view that the process of nuclear disarmament should begin and that it should start with an agreement on a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. In our view  this would not only open the way for progress to be made in relation to nuclear weapons but would also foster a climate for moving forward on arms control for other categories of weapons. In a world where suffering and death from want are brought so sharply to our attention  particularly in recent times  it is shameful that so much of the world's resources is being devoted to the manufacture and procurement of armaments* A recent estimate of world expenditure on arms puts it at an annual figure of $1 000 billion - an astounding indictment of the priorities in the world today. The lessons of the past have taught us the limits of military power  what is needed in our time are conditions of peace and economic well-being as the foundations for security. Our collective energies and resources should be channeled in that direction.Time is marching on  and too little is achieved in meeting the challenges being faced and the problems being posed. We meet in this Assembly year after year and express our common hopes for a better and safer world beyond the narrow vision of national interests; yet the political accommodation and adjustments to make them a reality are not made. International co-operation must be seen to be working if it is to be maintained and extended.There are disturbing trends which indicate that there are forces at work aimed at limiting the scope of international action and avoiding a multilateral approach in dealing with problems of the day. It is therefore important that results can be shown and progress made on the many problems facing the international community to reinforce continued faith in our multilateral institutions.One area in which there is an emerging consensus for international action is in relation to the situation in South Africa. Events over the past year or so have brought the issue to a critical point. Over 700 persons are estimated to have lost their lives in the continuing unrest in that country  and it must be clear to the oppressors that the people will not abandon their struggle  even in the face of the regime's murderous tactics. The killings  mass arrests  banning and detentions have proved to be of no avail in stemming the tide of resistance. There is but one solution: the apartheid system must be dismantled and replaced by an order based on equal rights for all South Africans. Apartheid cannot be reformed; it must be destroyed. Superficial adjustments and token changes are not acceptable.For years the regime has been stubbornly and arrogantly rejecting the demands for fundamental changes. Now the regime is beginning to feel the squeeze from the combined pressure of the uprising from within and sanctions imposed or threatened from without. Jamaica has long argued that economic sanctions by the world community was a necessary ingredient to bring about change in South Africa. We are encouraged to see that Governments which have hitherto been hesitant in adopting economic sanctions have begun to move in that direction. The measures that have been announced  though limited in scope  are a welcome beginning. But much more will be needed to convince the South African regime of the serious resolve of the international community on this question. We are therefore looking forward to the adoption of further measures to curtail investments and financial flows to South Africa and wider restrictions in economic relations.Jamaica considers it important that there should be no faltering or hesitation in taking far-reaching measures. It is time for the world community to act  and to act decisively. In the meanwhile  we wish to reiterate our support for and solidarity with those who are struggling so valiantly internally.For it is not just a question of oppression and injustice inside South Africa. Peace is at risk. South Africa continues to commit blatant acts of aggression against neighboring African States and to promote subversion and civil war in others. Over the past year it added further to its brutal and shameful record of aggression in a series of attacks against Angola and Botswana. No respect is shown for legality and the sovereign rights of African States in the region.In Namibia  the pattern is repeated. South Africa's contempt for international law and for the rights of the inhabitants of the Territory is astounding. Through bad faith and duplicity the regime has frustrated every effort for a negotiated solution. The plan adopted on the initiative of the Western contact group and so elaborately worked out in 1978 has been scuttled by South African deception and treachery. It has apparently now embarked on implementing its own plan for the Territory by the appointment of a puppet administration.There is clear need to take action against South Africa cm this question. We have a duty to the Namibian people  for whom the United Nations has direct responsibility as the legal administering authority for the Territory. The international community must  therefore  give urgent consideration as to what steps should now be taken. We consider it necessary for the Security Council to meet again in the near future to consider what collective action is to be taken to discharge its responsibilities and to secure the implementation of its resolutions.In our own region  the problems of Central America continue to be of great concern to us. Over the past year  fighting has continued  but we are encouraged by the patient and persevering diplomacy of the Contadora Group  which continues to enjoy the confidence and support of the international community in their search for a peaceful resolution of the conflicts among the States in the region. The regional commitment to finding a solution has been reinforced by the initiative to establish a four-member Support Group to assist in furthering the Contadora objectives. Jamaica fully supports these efforts. He particularly welcome the results of the meeting of Contadora and Central American Foreign Ministers held on 12 and 13 September in Panama City in which agreement was reached cm a time-table for negotiations on the Draft Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America which will enable the process to be completed before the end of November. We expect that by then all the parties will have signed the documents and will be ready to implement their provisions fully.The state of affairs in the Middle East must continue to receive our close attention. The basic issues are well-known. Our view is that the elements of an overall settlement have long been identified and have found general international acceptance. They involve the withdrawal of Israel from Arab territory occupied since the 1967 war  recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and the acknowledgment of the right of all States in the area to live in peace and security within recognized boundaries.New initiatives  such as that proposed by King Hussein of Jordan  create new opportunities which should be explored as a basis for peace negotiations. We cannot ignore actions that add further obstacles to the search for peace and contribute to a climate of tension  instability and insecurity to the region  we do not accept the assertion of any new doctrine which implies that the sovereignrights of a third party State can be nakedly violated in response to a perceived wrong elsewhere. Accordingly  we deplore the attack carried out by Israel in violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia.In other areas of regional conflict  there has been regrettably little movement in the past year. The war between Iran and Iraq continues to rage without an immediate prospect of peace  but it is important that the situation be not abandoned as hopeless. We continue to urge the Secretary-General to use his good offices to mediate between the parties.In Cyprus there is need to give every possible encouragement to the Secretary-General and to efforts to revive the inter-communal talks and avoid the imposition of a solution by fait accompli.Regrettably  there has been little change in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  and we must renew the call for withdrawal of foreign forces from the respective countries. We strongly deplore the reported atrocities and violations of human rights that have occurred.We note with interest that on the Korean peninsula bilateral contacts between the two Koreas have begun and we hope that these preliminary contacts will develop into a fruitful dialog contributing to the reduction of tension in the area and laying the basis for a future of peaceful relations.I now turn to issues of international economic co-operation. The international community needs to examine closely the course of events in developing countries over the past few years. However one looks at the problems of the third world  the necessary requirements for their solution are clear. But there are no short-term panaceas. Developing countries require tine. We require resources  we need time to make and consolidate important structural changes  some brought on by the severe economic difficulties of the past few years  others by conscious policy action. we need resources to ease the difficulties associated with these changes and to put in place the productive inputs that the long-term development of our economies require.I say that the international community needs to examine the course of events over the past few years for a good reason. The record shows that the developing countries have made considerable effort to deal with their problems. The fact that our economies are still in crisis is a measure of the intractability of the problems we face  not a reflection of the sacrifice and effort peoples and governments in the third world have made in the past few years.These problems and the plight of our countries have been seriously exacerbated by the continuation of unfavorable international economic conditions. The economic recovery in the industrial countries  which is vital to the overall well-being of the world economy and  particularly  to export prospects of the developing countries  has been uneven  and now shows worrying signs of running out of steam. This is particularly disconcerting; for despite minor gains in output and more significant gains in trade in 1984  per capita product in the developing world remains below what it was at the beginning of the decade.In Latin America and the Caribbean  which has been struggling to maintain levels of economic well-being achieved before the onset of the current turbulent decade  per capita product was almost 9 per cent lower in 1984 than in 1980 and similar to the level obtained by the region in 1977. There can be no argument with the view that the first half of the 1980s has been the most difficult period for the developing countries since the depression years of the 1930s.We have seen in this period major adverse changes in the terms of trade for many primary commodities  the sharp rise in international interest rates  severe cutbacks in international lending  and all of this on the heels of the energy price increases at the end of the 1970s  to which so many developing countries were still adapting.The result has been economic difficulties of unprecedented proportions in our countries. He should not forget that in an important sense it is not countries which feel pain  it is people. People living in the developing countries have seen their standards of living fall since 1980  they have seen social services curtailed as the international recession and other external shocks have led to internal economic imbalances and dislocations of growing magnitude of Jamaica does not make this point idly. One World Bank study which assesses the impact of external shocks on the balance-of-payments of selected developing countries has placed Jamaica at the top of the list in terms of the severity of the impact on our balance of payments in the period 1979-1982.Yet in the face of all this we have seen  at all times  evidence of the resilience and the will of people in the third world to cope  adjust and press forward. For example  the share of manufacturing in the total exports of developing countries as a whole has grown from 15 to 50 per cent in the past two decades. Although this is still well short of the target of a 25 per cent share of world industrial production  it is indicative of the economic strategy that is being pursued. Even as they struggle to cope with external shocks a significant number of developing countries are trying to diversify their productive capacities and to make their economies more efficient. This is particularly reflected in the fact that the world Bank has already lent some $4.5 billion for structural adjustment programs.At another level  evidence of the demonstrated will of developing countries to address the problems they face is found in the reduction of the cumulative current account deficit. Developing countries have reduced that deficit by almost two-thirds from a high of over $105 billion in 1981 to just $35 billion in 1984. Even this? bald statistic does not do justice to the firmness of fiscal and monetary policies that have had to be introduced. The maturity and stamina of Governments have been tested and the heroic fortitude of the peoples of the third world has been demonstrated. As one prominent public figure from an industrial country has said:""The citizens of the developing world cannot be expected to tighten their belts indefinitely nor can debtor countries continue to be net exporters of capital 'We can clearly assert  therefore  that two key issues are protectionism and debt. The international community must ensure a trading environment which is free from tariff and non-tariff barriers against the products of developing countries.The irony is that the more developing countries seek to broaden their economic base by moving into areas such as manufacturing and non-traditional products  the more intensive are the pressures for protectionism in the industrial countries. Fat for them the solution does not lie in protecting declining industries or sectors from more cost-effective producers in the third world. The interests of efficiency and equity are best served when costs and benefits associated with shifting comparative advantage are not nullified at the points of entry by tariff and non-tariff barriers which penalize emerging industries and sectors in the developing world.This is not an abstract concern. The World Bank has estimated that an increase in protectionism large enough to produce a 10 per cent deterioration in the terms of trade of Latin America and the Caribbean exacts a cost from our region equivalent to the real interest cost of the region's entire debt. The situation  therefore  requires wise and firm leadership. Common sense tells us that if developing countries cannot export they will be able neither to pay their debts nor to continue to be a major market for the exports of the industrialized countries.The shift from equity to debt financing that began in the 1970s now results in massive debt-service payments by developing countries. Last year those payments amounted to $100 billion. That outflow has contributed in significant measure to the overall net resource transfer that occurred from capital importing developing countries to developed countries in 1984. In Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole  35 per cent of export earnings were needed to make interest payments on debt in 1984. In one country the figure was as high as 57 per cent. This cannot be sustained. The debt problem had its genesis in scarce resources: we borrow to supplement our resources and to achieve greater returns in the future. But the unprecedented economic events of the first half of the decade have created the need for a breathing space. In the immediate future difficult decisions must be made. Those decisions should be consistent with a tradition of fidelity to obligations as well as showing a full understanding of the difficult social and economic realities which now exist in many debtor countries. The debt issue urgently requires judicious and sympathetic handling within a framework which recognizes that it is not simply now a matter of meeting obligations  which Jamaica  for one  is pledged to do but has become part of the problem of development itself. Jamaica continues to support the proposal for an international conference on money and finance for development  where these and other related issues can receive the integrated treatment we believe is necessary.It is precisely because of problems of these dimensions that there can be no shirking of the national responsibility to be resolute and creative in tackling the problems of development. Equally  and it is more important to say so in this forum  it is precisely because of the international nature of problems such as these that there can be no retreat from multilateral co-operation.This year the activities of the United Nations have been marked by two important events: the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for women  held in Nairobi  Kenya  and the observance of International Youth Year.Jamaica is pleased to have participated in the Conference  much of the success of which was due to the efforts of the Government of Kenya. The adoption of the Forward Looking Strategies was a notable achievement  and we place particular emphasis on the implementation of the programs to the year 2000 for advancing the status of women and for their full integration.As part of the celebrations for International Youth Year  Jamaica played host to a Youth Festival and International Youth Conference which issued a significantdeclaration.In reflecting on the achievements of the United Nations over the past 40 years  one accomplishment which stands out  and one in which Jamaica takes special pride in being associated with  is the conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea signed at Monte go Bay on 10 December 1982. I am happy to report that  on the closing date for signature last December  the Convention had 159 signatories  a clear and unmistakable indication of the broad support it enjoys in the international community.The Preparatory Commission  which has the responsibility for implementation of the Convention  held two meetings during the year  and we are satisfied that it is making progress in carrying out its mandate. But we must note with concern that  under national legislation  licenses are being issued which purport to grant exploitation rights to parts of the international sea-bed area. This amounts to a direct challenge to the mandate given to the Preparatory Commission and a defiance of the will of the international community and is totally unacceptable. At its Geneva meeting the Preparatory Commission adopted a declaration in which it reaffirmed that the only regime for the exploitation of the area and its resources is that established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  and rejected any claim  agreement or action incompatible with the Convention as a basis for creating legal rights to the international sea-bed area which is the common heritage of mankind. We once again urge Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the Convention as a tangible affirmation of their support for it.For the United Nations  the future holds great challenges  and the price of inaction or failure is frighteningly high. In disarmament  in peace and security  in international economic co-operation  in the field of human rights  in the care of the environment  in all these areas and others  we have an uncompromising obligation to ourselves and to future inhabitants of this planet. Those who emphasize the shortcomings of the United Nations and who disregard its achievements should be made to recognize that there can be no turning back. The best hope for mankind is to persevere in the search for solutions through the institutions of multilateral co-operation  for the common bond of humanity transcends the divisions among States."
"65",3567,"JOR",40,1985,"It is a great honor for me to take part in celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Established as the paramount international organization  its goals were set in the very first words of the Preamble to its Charter  namely:""...to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom ..."" It gives me great pleasure to open my remarks with a word of greeting to this world Organization  to the States which participated in its establishment and to all the eminent persons who were instrumental in formulating its lofty principles. I likewise greet those who contributed  with honor and sincerity  to the growth of this great institution  as well as those who have served its aims and principles. Special recognition is due to the successive Secretary-Generals of the United Nations. In particular  I am pleased to convey  in my own name and on behalf of my country  my warmest greetings and sincerest best wishes to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.I am also happy to convey my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Jaime de Pinies on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly.I am confident of his able leadership and I wish him success in this task. I would also like to thank He. Paul John Lusaka for his worthy efforts in conducting the presidency of the previous session of the General Assembly.I would also like to take this opportunity to express once again  on my own behalf and on that of the Government and people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  our deep feelings of sorrow and sympathy for the Government and people of Mexico on the tragedy that befell them as a result of the recent earthquake. I pray that they will overcome this tragedy with perseverance  courage and faith.In the past 40 years  the world has inevitably undergone a number of developments and changes characterized by unprecedented speed and diversity. Every social or scientific advance has brought with it a new reality  fraught with striking ironies. Great aspirations inspired by a particular development soon collided with apprehensions and negative effects arising from that same development.During the same period  the world was thrust into the nuclear era with both its destructive devices and its power-generating plants. Mankind enjoyed the fruits of massive progress in science and technology only to live in constant terror of lethal weaponry made possible by that same progress. Similarly  the communications revolution has brought States and nations dramatically closer  but has also enabled international terrorism to prosper. The nations of the world have become more conscious of their common concerns  but at the same time have been forced to face the reality of a world divided into a largely affluent and pioneering North and a largely impoverished and recipient South.With the growth in numbers of independent States seeking amalgamation within regional organizations has come a trend towards separatism along racial or ideological lines. The swan song of colonialism has been accompanied by attempts  in a different guise  to exercise control over smaller or less affluent States  and South Africa continues to exercise its policy of apartheid. While the world is relatively relieved whenever it seems that some form of super-Power detente has been achieved  it is still faced with local ware in which the great Powers take part through their proxies. States spend lavishly on armaments but are stinting in contributions that would save Billions from famine  drought and disease. Industry develops only to produce anxiety about the environment. Material wealth increases at the expense of spiritual values. The borders of our world are being extended to outer space* but we have lingering doubts about the future of the Earth.These and other developments have  of course  reflected on the United Nations itself  since this process has influenced and shaped the attitude of each State  or group of states  towards the United Nations and has defined the Method of their interaction with it. However  in spite of disparities in attitudes  all States have clung to the United Nations  because mankind  under threat of existing tension and instability  needs the ultimate recourse it represents.But has the United Nations fulfilled that role? In assessing its work  whether positively or negatively  we are really talking about ourselves  since the United Nations is not a separate entity but represents us all collectively.During its 40-year existence  the United Nations has achieved a number of spectacular results  either through the specialized agencies  which have rendered invaluable services to the international community at large  or through the General Assembly and its organs. Wherever an armed conflict has broken out  it has been available to mediate between the warring parties  or to separate them. When millions of innocent people have become refugees  it has been there to provide assistance. In a world dominated by the dictates of military power  the United Nations has remained a conscience for peace and a ray of hope in the midst of the dark forces of evil.On the other hand  as everyone knows  the United Nations has not lived up to all our expectations. For example  its attempts to formulate a new world order based on co-operation  equity  respect for human rights and self-determination have not been entirely successful. Nor has it managed to resolve some vital issues related to international peace and security. Why  we may ask  has the United Nations  viewed by all as a last resort  failed in such endeavors?The principles of the United Nations and its authority are closely linked to respect for its resolutions and their implementation. Were this link to be severed  the gap between principles and authority would widen  leading to greater tensions among the Member States. In today's world  where the walls housing the human family have been pushed to the limit by the deadly weapons they encompass  there is the abiding fear that these tensions would set one of the world's hot spots afire  resulting in the destruction of the entire house.This truth would seem to take us back to the beginning of the century  when the law of might sparked the First World War. Although established to prevent a recurrence of war  the League of Nations proved ineffective in forestalling the outbreak of the Second World War  out of whose ashes grew the present Organization. Everyone hoped that it would succeed where its predecessor had failed and spare the world a third world war.A probing look at the disputes raging on our planet with the accompanying arms race can only produce a chill of terror in our souls as long as the force of arms holds sway over the destinies of nations; and relations within the frame of the United Nations are no more than a reflection of existing inequities between the strong and the weak  the rich and the poor  the large and the small. If  God forbid  the United Nations were to crumble and a new world war to erupt  it would leave behind nothing but a massive grave of nations.From this standpoint  it is the joint responsibility of all nations to address themselves to the hot spots in Asia  Europe  Africa  Latin America and the Middle East  with the aim of preserving mankind  its culture and its achievements. What else but the United Nations - which represents man's hope to live free from the threat and scourge of war - is more qualified to assume this awesome responsibility?I hope the Assembly will bear with me for confining the remainder of my remarks to the Middle East. I do so because the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan lies at the heart of this troubled region and is directly affected by events there.In the Middle East today  the tragic war between Iraq and Iran has entered its sixth year  although the rationale behind the confrontation has all but disappeared.International attempts have failed to end the war  or to persuade the Iranian leadership to heed the voice of reason and respond to Iraq's sincere and persistent call for peace  which would enable the two neighbors to live in security and stability.My country  which stands by Iraq's right to defend itself and by its call for the resolution of the conflict through peaceful means  urges the Iranian leadership to respond to the calls for peace and enter into negotiations with brotherly Iraq in order to put an end to this tragedy.The other flash point in the Middle East is the Arab-Israeli conflict  or the Palestinian problem. This is the fourth occasion I have had of addressing this lofty body on the issuer When I first spoke here in 19C0  I sought to draw attention to the dangers inherent in the continued indifference of the international community to the Palestinian legitimate right to live in human dignity. Seven years later  in the wake of the 1967 war  I warned that peace would not be achieved in the Middle East unless it was coupled with justice. In 1979  I faulted the position taken by those who continued to deny recognition to the Palestinians as a people  like all others  a people that had lived on a continuous basis in a distinctly defined territory  namely Palestine  for several long centuries. Today  a quarter of a century after my first address  the denial of Palestinian rights to self-determination  human dignity  justice and freedom in their ancestral homeland continues to constitute the core of the Palestinian problem and the essence of the Middle East dispute. The Arab States and the Palestinian people look to the United Nations to shoulder its responsibilities in accordance with the Charter and the implementation of the resolutions relevant to the question.In seeking recourse to the United Nations  we are guided by two considerations. First  it was in the United Nations that the Palestinian issue was created  through the Palestinian partition plan. Second  from the beginning  the Palestinian issue has been inseparable from the United Nations  since each was influenced by international attitudes prevailing at the time. They were both affected by changing spheres of influence and great-Power rivalry  as well as by the demise of colonialism and the emergence of national developments in developing countries.No issue brought before the United Nations has riveted world attention as acutely as the Palestinian issue. No issue has made as many demands on United Nations responsibilities or poised as great a challenge to its ability to live up to its declared alias as the Palestinian issue. No issue has generated as many United Nations resolutions as the Palestinian issue.The fact is that the Palestinian issue and the United Nations are twins born out of war  twins which emerged  grew and suffered together.No one should assume that we are comfortable with that commonality of destiny. On the contrary  it is our hope that it will soon come to an end through the achievement of a just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian problem and related issues. This should be done in accordance with the United Nations Charter and through the implementation of the resolutions of the Organization  particularly the four that constitute the balanced foundation for any just and peaceful settlement. These are General Assembly resolutions 181 (II) of 1947  which stipulated the partition of Palestine  and 194 (III) of 1948 pertaining to the solution of the problem of the Palestinian refugees. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 1967  which calls on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and reaffirms the right of every State to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  and Security Council resolution 338 (1973) of 1973  which calls for negotiations among the parties to the conflict under appropriate auspices.This succession of resolutions  along with other similar ones  on one particular issue over a period of four decades  coinciding with the five wars caused by that issue  quite simply highlights the complications created by certain Member states not conforming to the principles of the United Nations. Hence  the problem has persisted as a serious threat to regional and global stability and security.Frankly  Jordan  as a use tuber of both the community of Arab States and the United Nations  striving hard to preserve confidence in this Organization  has suffered greatly from the failure to implement relevant resolutions concerning the Palestinian question.My remarks are not intended to denigrate or write off the role of the United Nations. Bather  my intention is to urge an intensification of efforts and a greater determination to realize the Organization's aims. As the late President Eisenhower noted shortly after the Suez war of 1956:""He are approaching a fateful moment when either we must recognize that the United Nations is unable to restore peace in this area  or the United Nations must renew with increased vigor its efforts to bring about Israeli withdrawal.... If [the United Nations] does nothing  if it accepts the ignoring of its repeated resolutions calling for the withdrawal of invading forces  then it will have a omitted failure. That failure will be a blow to the authority and influence of the United Nations in the world and to the hopes which humanity placed in the United Nations as the means of achieving peace with -justice.""The United Nations is at a similar crossroads today. To my mind  the future standing of this Organization will be decided on the basis of its success or failure in achieving peace in the world  particularly in the Middle East.Just as the Palestinian issue and the United Nations have had a related history during the past four decades  the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples have shared the closest ties for several centuries  ties manifested through history and destiny  since the inception of the Palestinian problem  at the end of the First World War  Jordan has been closely connected with it. It has been seriously affected by its vagaries and has interacted vigorously with the people of Palestine. In 1947 the Palestine problem assumed an international dimension  with the result that the United Nations took over the responsibility of dealing with the issue. Since then  Jordan  because of its distinctive relationship with the Palestinian people  has co-operated with the United Nations and co-ordinated its efforts with it  along with its Arab and Moslem brethren  in the hope that this problem would find a solution. During the past 40 years  my country has pursued a constant policy of positive engagement with the efforts of the United Nations  as long as they were geared towards a just peace  as stipulated in the Charter.As is well known  in the wake of the 1967 war  I personally participated in formulating Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Our clear understanding then was that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East depended fully on Israeli withdrawal. Our conviction was strengthened as a result of our contacts with several of the States concerned  including the United States of America. It was further strengthened by the fact that the principle of withdrawal was indivisible  and that aggression should not be rewarded. When our efforts failed  as had our attempts to bring about acceptance by Israel of the principle of withdrawal in return for peace  that failure brought about the war of 1973  when the Security Council adopted its resolution 338 (1973)  leading to a cease-fire and emphasizing the need to implement the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Again we supported the resolution  and to that end took part in the Geneva peace conference.Subsequently the United Nations recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLQ) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  thus paving the way to participation by the Palestinian people  through its legitimate representative  in the peace process. As the foremost party to the conflict  the Palestinian people ought to be the foremost party to peace.In September 1982  during the summit meeting at Fez  the Arabs reaffirmed their collective desire for peace through the adoption of an Arab peace plan formulated with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  and accepted by it. The Arab nation  through a seven-member committee  persisted in its efforts. The committee was entrusted with the task of explaining the plan to the five permanent members of the Security Council in the hope that the peace process might be invigorated.His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco headed the Committee during its visit to United Nations Headquarters and to Washington  while I led the visits to the other four capitals  which indicated  along with various international circles  their satisfaction with the Arab move* Yet  the peace process remained dormant.On the basis of a number of realistic considerations  it became evident to us that the peace efforts required a new approach that would enable the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the peace process. In the light of these considerations  we held consultations with the Palatine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  leading  on 11 February of this year  to an accord regulating joint political action by the Jordanian Government and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The accord was to serve as a mechanism for the Arab peace plan and part of the joint Arab effort forming one of its links. This accord calls for the implementation of United Nations resolutions relevant to the Palestinian question through an international conference with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council  as well as all the parties to the conflict.Following the conclusion of the accord  Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization then proceeded to make contact with a number of great-Power capitals for the purpose of intensifying the peace process. Because of the special relationship between the United States and Israel - the party that has so far blocked the road to peace - Jordan made intensive representations to Washington in the hope that the United States would shoulder its responsibilities as a super-Power with a stake in world peace  a record of human rights and a history of faith in freedom and in the right of peoples to self-determination. It was hoped that the United States would join hands with the many other countries that supported this initiative and bring its influence  coupled with theirs  to bear on rallying the will of the international community in order to achieve stability  peace and prosperity  so as to serve the interests of all the nations of the region and beyond.He are prepared to negotiate  under appropriate auspices  with the Government of Israel  promptly and directly  under the basic tenets of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). These negotiations must result in the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and resolve all aspects of the Palestinian problem.It is Jordan's position that the appropriate auspices would be an international conference hosted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  to which the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties to the conflict would be invited for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East.My country believes that the Palestinian question and the Middle East crisis fall squarely within the responsibility of the United Nations  as well as those countries with a special interest in the conflict. It thus regards any consultation on the Middle East situation between the United States and the Soviet Union as both necessary and positive. Consequently  we look forward with great hope to the forthcoming meeting between the two leaders  Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  and we wish their meeting every success.The Arab faith in peace is equaled only by our faith in right. Peace is one of our most sacred creeds. It is our greeting in prayers  and also used by the inhabitants of heaven  as stated in the Holy Koran. To us  peace is an attribute of God and has the connotation of right  as both peace and right have a common meaning. Since 1967  in this spirit  the Arabs proceeded towards peace  without success  while Israel  because of its victory at that time  has allowed its bent for expansion to take precedence over the desire for peace. It proceeded to announce the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights  to expropriate over half the territory of the West Bank and to plant settlements in every part of the occupied territories. Some leaders in the Israeli Government publicly proclaimed their opposition to giving up those territories and adopted extremist policies geared towards realizing their aggressive objectives and frustrating the peace effort.If Israel persists in its intransigence and places obstacles in the way of peace or if it succeeds in exercising a negative effect on the United States or other countries  the result will be the collapse of any hope of achieving a peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis. Together with any country or countries  supporting its negative stance  Israel will have to bear the responsibility for lost opportunities as well as for the growth of extremism  whose consequences are not difficult to predict.The absence and suppression of justice can only open the way for extremists to exploit such a condition and to perpetrate acts of violence against innocent people. I hereby state before the Assembly Jordan's unwavering position in the condemnation of terrorism  irrespective of its nature and source. In so doing  I am reaffirming the resolution taken by the Arab leaders at the summit meeting held in Casablanca last month. We naturally reject the misleading attempts by those who equate terrorism with movements of national liberation and the right of peoples to resist occupation.As I have already noted  the Middle East is beset by a ferocious war in the Gulf  which has entered its sixth year  as well as by the Palestinian question  which lies at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict  now almost 40 years old. The two conflicts have wreaked havoc on stability in the region  draining its resources and threatening world peace. And both will continue as long as the international will to restrain them remains fragile or missing.The bleak situation in the Middle East is in stack contrast with the region's potential  given normal circumstance. We hardly need to be reminded that this area  which is a crossroads between three continents  was the cradle of civilization which gave direction to man's future progress  or that it was the home of the great religions  of the world's holy books and illustrious prophets  or that it was the original setting for the arts and sciences  or that it was Islam which unified the peoples and the countries of the region under the banner of a single language  homogeneous in character  and a message of love at:-- inspiration for all mankind.It is time that peace prevailed in this important region  for the good of its own people and for the rest of the world. Now is the time to work together for a brighter future marked by effort  constructive action and positive achievement.I look forward to a day when the parties to the conflict will till the soil  reap the harvests  plant trees and enjoy the fruits of their labor  in confidence and security. I also look forward to a time when all the children of Abraham can have access to their religious sites in the Holy Land in freedom and peace  guided by a spirit of amity  love and faith in one God.Much has been said about the Holy City of Jerusalem representing an insurmountable obstacle to peace. I say to you that Jerusalem is rather the key to peace  the gate through which the warm rays of peace will engulf all the people of the entire region. Home of the monotheistic religions  Jerusalem can be none other than a unifying force for the noblest of human aspirations namely the desire for lasting peace.One of the prophets of Judaism  Christianity and Islam was lost for 40 years in the wilderness. It is my hope that after 40 years of uncertainty in the wilderness of fanaticism  hatred and conflict  there will emerge a future ofpromise  when Palestinian and Jew can live in peace in the land of peace where hope will replace fear  trust replace suspicion  where amity will edge out bitterness  and understanding will prevail.A rare  historic opportunity now lies before the United nations  an opportunity for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This opportunity should not be missed  as has been the case with many previous ones. Without your efforts and support  I am afraid that the budding promise of peace will wither before it has had the chance to grow.Let us marshal our resources in the cause of peace. Let us make our concern for the future the only constraint in our calculations.Faith in peace is the cornerstone of the United Nations  just as the United Nations is the cornerstone of peace  which is itself the basis of all progress and prosperity.Our Organization is now 40 years old - an age in the life of man signaling the start of a new phase  characterized by a growing experience and the emergence of wisdom and vision  a greater sense of responsibility and a flowering of moral courage. We sincerely wish the United Nations a similar progress towards a more determined will  greater co-operation and a renewed commitment to the principles of the Charter - for the good of mankind and civilization  and in the cause of peace.May God guide our steps  bless our deliberations in this session  and move us towards a resumption of the long march towards co-operation and a spirit of human accomplishment.Thank you  Mr. President and colleagues  and peace be upon you  and God's mercy and his blessings."
"66",3614,"JPN",40,1985,"On behalf of the Government and people of Japan  I should like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Please be assured that the delegation of Japan will spare no effort in co-operating with you as you carry out your important duties.At the same time  I should like to express my sincere appreciation to the President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly Mr. Paul John Firmino Lusaka  for the very capable manner in which he discharged his awesome responsibilities.I should also like to take this opportunity to a pay tribute once again to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his determined efforts and capable leadership in the face of the harsh international situation.Before proceeding further  I wish on behalf of the people of Japan to express deep sympathy to the Government and people of Mexico in the terrible tragedy wrought by two earthquakes last week  which took thousands of lives and caused untold material damage. I wish to pay a tribute to the people of Mexico  who  under the leadership of their President  Mr. Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado  are working courageously to overcome this unprecedented calamity. Japan  for its part  is urgently taking every possible action to assist them.Now approaching its fortieth anniversary  the United Nations has grown into a truly global organization with the participation of virtually all the countries of the world. Although the United Nations has had some success in containing regional conflicts and mobilizing world opinion to deter aggression and censure it whenever it occurs  other factors  including East-West discord and the divergent interests of conflicting parties  have prevented the United Nations from fulfilling the peace-keeping functions envisaged for it at the time of its founding.In looking back over the 40-year history of the United Nations  I am struck by the progress made in decolonization in Africa and elsewhere and by the fact that over 150 countries with differing cultures  traditions  political systems and policy positions have been able to gather here and  through lively discussion  share ideas on how to overcome the many grave problems facing the world and reaffirm their interdependence within the international community.The important role which the United Nations has played in promoting economic and social development  environmental protection and human rights  in enhancing the status of women and in progressively developing and codifying international law must be fully recognized and duly acknowledged. I also wish to note the welcome trend whereby Member States are seeking general agreement among all interested parties in order to adopt resolutions by consensus rather than by majority vote  in an effort to enhance their effectiveness.Yet  looking ahead to the 21st century  I believe we have reached a major turning point if the United Nations is to be a vital and effective force for succeeding generations. I should like here to highlight two specific areas requiring immediate attention.First  the United Nations must discharge its responsibilities in the field of peace-keeping more fully  and it behooves the permanent members of the Security Council and  indeed  all United Nations Member States seriously to study ways of enhancing the Security Council's peace-keeping functions. At the same time? I believe that  with the support of all Member States  the peace-keeping functions of the Secretary-General should be strengthened so that his quiet diplomacy can be more effective.Another crucial issue which the United Nations must tackle is that of administrative and financial reform. In carrying out its activities over the past 40 years the secretariats of the United Nations and its specialized agencies have steadily expanded and it may well be that some of their activities are outdated  not urgently needed or even redundant. I am concerned that the United Nations system may be losing the unwavering support of peoples around the world. It is thus imperative that the Organization itself make a determined effort towards effective administrative and financial reform so that it can function more efficiently. Only in this way will Member States - developing countries beset with difficulties in economic management as well as major contributing countries experiencing severe financial strain and striving to regain fiscal health - be able to gain the understanding of their peoples and continue their support of the United Nations for many years to come.I wish on this occasion to pay high tribute to the Secretary-General for the serious efforts he has been making in this regard. In his report on the work of the Organization this year  the Secretary-General appeals for ""the support of national domestic constituencies in each Member State"" (A/40/1  p. 13) and strongly urges the need for more ""practical international service"" (ibid.). I concur fully with this appeal.In an effort toward comprehensive administrative and financial reform  I should like to propose the establishment of a ""group of eminent persons for a more efficient United Nations "" so that the world body and its specialized agencies would function efficiently into the twenty-first century. Comprised of a small number of individuals from developed and developing countries  the group would contribute to a thorough review of the administrative and financial operations of the organizations within the United Nations system. At the same time  it would provide an opportunity for undertaking' an objective study of the management of those organizations with a view to guaranteeing their efficiency  so that they would be of greater use to the people of both developed and developing countries in meeting their genuine needs now and in the future. I hope that a concrete proposal on this question will be considered at this session of the General Assembly  and I call upon all Member states to act today to assure that this irreplaceable Organization will operate more efficiently.1945 was the year that saw the birth of the United Nations as well as the atomic bomb  since then the world's nuclear arsenals have undergone tremendous changes both in quantity and in quality  and an overkill capability has long since been achieved. Thus the prime imperative for the world today is that of working to halt this nuclear arms race and ultimately to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons. Indeed  the urgency of arms control and disarmament grows greater with each passing year. Yet at the same time it must be admitted that world peace and security is sustained by the balance of power which includes nuclear arms. In promoting disarmament  we must recognize these realities of the international situation and seek to achieve a balance at the lowest possible level of armament.Thus I welcomed the initiation last March of a new round of arms control and disarmament talks by the United States and the Soviet Union. Both states have a special responsibility toward the international community. No matter how trying these negotiations may prove  it is important that they be aware of the awesome burdens they must bear as the world's two most powerful nations  and that responding to the hopes of all peoples  they negotiate seriously and constructively for the achievement of substantive results. I strongly hope that at their summit meeting scheduled for November the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union will be fully cognizant of their grave responsibilities and will do their utmost to build a framework for world peace and security.The call for the united States and the Soviet union to take the initiative in efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament was unanimously supported at the Third Review Conference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  which closed just a few days ago. The participating countries also reaffirmed the significance of the NPT regime  and Japan would like to point out again the need to maintain and strengthen the NPT regime  as well as strongly to urge nuclear-armed China and France and  indeed  all other non-signatory countries to recognize the importance of the NPT regime and to become parties to the Treaty without delay.Japan has long emphasized a comprehensive nuclear-test ban as an important aspect of nuclear disarmament  and last year at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament I proposed a step-by-step formula under which the nuclear-test ban would be steadily extended to include lower-yield weapons as multilateral verification capabilities improved. I also suggested the creation of an international co-operative framework for nuclear-test detection. Japan is confident that this approach  modest as it may seem  is a most realistic means of achieving an effective nuclear-test ban. I hope that an ad hoc committee will be established as soon as possible at next year's Conference on Disarmament to study these proposals as well as other substantive questions.Disarmament issues are not limited to nuclear weapons  however. In the non-nuclear field  as I stated in my address to last year's session of the General Assembly  I strongly hope that all countries will take a realistic approach to the banning of chemical weapons and that a global and comprehensive treaty will be drawn up as soon as possible. On the issue of the prevention of an arms race in outer space  I welcome the fact that this year's Conference on Disarmament has established an ad hoc committee and has taken the first steps toward examining this important issue.Z should like next to say a few words on some of the international issues which I believe are especially important and to explain Japan's foreign policy efforts as they relate to these issues.It is impossible in today's increasingly interdependent international community for a country in one region to be oblivious to conflict in any other region. This is not to imply  however  that countries are justified in intervening in regional conflicts for their own purposes. Japanese policy is one of working in close consultation and co-operation with the united Nations to create a climate that would contribute to the efforts of the countries directly involved as well as of other countries within the region to settle the conflict on their own.Regarding the situation on the Korean peninsula  Japan welcomes the various efforts toward establishing a North-South dialog and the progress that has recently been made. We are very hopeful that these discussions will yield substantive results. Japan  for its part  will continue to co-operate in every way possible to create a climate conducive to the relaxation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. In this regard we were sincerely pleased that young men and women from both North and South were able to compete side by side in the universal Games recently held in Japan.Moreover  if both North and South would consider joining the United Nations as a step toward the reunification of the Korean peninsula  Japan would welcome and support membership for both of them as a means of relaxing tensions and furthering the universality of the Organization.Elsewhere in Asia  the problem of Kampuchea remains a threat to regional peace and stability. Japan holds the view that this problem cannot be solved until all foreign troops are withdrawn from Kampuchea and the people's right to self-determination is restored. Japan has insisted that determined efforts based on this view must be made  bearing in mind Kampuchea's future needs. Thus  at the Post-Ministerial Conference with the Dialog Partners  held by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) last July  I proposed the following four principles which should underlie our future efforts on this problem: first  the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and self-determination for the Kampuchean people; secondly  the promotion of dialog between the countries concerned; thirdly  the reaffirmation of our support for the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea so as not to acquiesce in the present situation as a fait accompli; and fourthly  education and vocational training assistance for Kampuchean refugees as part of a human resources development effort.In the belief that these refugees have an important role to play in Kampuchea's eventual reconstruction  Japan hopes that  with the co-operation of the parties concerned  appropriate plans will be drawn up for their education and training. We are prepared to co-operate in every possible way with the implementation of such plans.Hoping to foster a climate conducive to the peaceful solution of the Kampuchean problem  I have made an active effort over the past year to meet and discuss issues with the leaders of the Governments concerned  including Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Viet Nam and Prime Minister Son Sann of Democratic Kampuchea. I intend to continue these efforts to promote an early and peaceful solution to this situation.I find it most regrettable that there are as yet no signs of a solution to the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq which has gone on for five long years. At last year's General Assembly session I presented an urgent proposal for the prompt implementation of a ban on the use of chemical weapons and the assurance of safe navigation in the Gulf  including the safety of port and harbor facilities. I have since taken every opportunity to urge the leaders of both Iran and Iraq to accept this proposal. Convinced that it provides an effective means for achieving a gradual scaling down of hostilities leading to the attainment of a comprehensive settlement  I very much hope that they will respond positively and proceed with discussions on the basis of this proposal.I deeply appreciate the Secretary-General's efforts in visiting Iran and Iraq and in making various proposals for the deescalation of the conflict there. I hope that further progress will be made so as to bring about some form of dialog between the two sides through the Secretary-General.Furthermore  in appealing to the Security Council  whose primary responsibility is the maintenance of international peace and security  to play an impartial and even more active role for the resolution of the conflict  I earnestly hope that the day will soon arrive when the two sides come before the Council to present their positions there.Mindful of the positions of the two parties  Japan will continue  in close consultation with like-minded countries  to make strenuous and patient efforts to create a climate conducive to peace in the region.The problem of Middle East peace and the situation in Lebanon remain causes for deep concern. Japan has the highest regard for the serious efforts being made by the parties concerned for peace in the Middle East. In the belief that present circumstances offer an excellent opportunity for progress towards peace in the region  Japan strongly hopes that all parties will redouble their efforts towards this end. This July I visited Jordan  Syria and Saudi Arabia  where I discussed the issues personally with the leaders of these countries as well as with Chairman Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Subsequently I also had a frank exchange of views with the Israeli leadership. Through such dialogs with the leaders of the countries concerned  Japan will continue its efforts to foster conditions that will lead to peace in the Middle East.On the problem of Afghanistan  I once more call upon all parties concerned for the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet troops  the restoration of the Afghan people's right to self-determination and a safe and honorable return for the refugees. At the same time  I strongly support the efforts of the Secretary-General and very much hope that progress will be made in the ongoing proximity talks.Japan finds the racial discrimination in South Africa intolerable and takes the firm position that it must be abolished totally and without delay. The internal reforms being advanced by the Government of South Africa fall far short of the expectations that had been raised in South Africa and abroad. Japan deeply deplores the present situation in South Africa - a situation that has taken a toll of hundreds of lives over the past year.Under the circumstances  Japan believes there is an urgent need for the Government of South Africa to state clearly and in no uncertain terms that it intends to disband apartheid and enter unconditionally into discussions with the leaders of the black community on specific steps towards ending that system. Japan calls upon all involved to join their energies in the search for a negotiated solution.Japan has been a steadfast opponent of apartheid  and its measures against South Africa are among the strictest of those taken by industrialized democracies. Moreover  Japan is determined to take whatever steps it considers necessary until the Government of South Africa embarks upon drastic and specific reforms for the abolition of apartheid.On the issue of Namibian independence  Japan hopes that it will be attained speedily through the complete implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978). Japan  therefore  considers null and void the establishment of the interim government through the Multi-Party Conference  and any other measures taken by the Government of South Africa in contravention of these resolutions.The situation in Latin America is notable for the progress being made towards democratization in recent years. Believing that democratization contributes to Latin America's long-term political stability  Japan welcomes this trend. At the same time  however  international political and economic difficulties  such as the conflicts in Central America and the problem of burgeoning debts  continue to beset the region.Indeed  the situation in Central America is still dangerous  and Japan is watching developments there with concern. Japan continues to support the peace efforts being made by the Contadora group. I hope these efforts will gain broad international backing  including that of the recently formed South American support group  and that they will be pursued even more vigorously. At the same time  Japan strongly hopes that the Central American countries themselves will make even greater efforts for peace in the region  as well as for democratization and national reconciliation within their respective borders.Japan has been maintaining a close dialog with the countries of Latin America. After leaving New York I shall visit Panama and Brazil to hold a wide-ranging exchange of views with the leaders of those countries. I am also pleased to state that while I am here the Foreign Minister of Panama and the United States Secretary of State and I will be exchanging notes on the Arrangement Concerning the Commission for the Study of Alternatives to the Panama Canal. Japan is prepared to take an active role in the matter and in this way further strengthen its relations with the countries of Latin America.I should like next to say a few words on Japan's relations with the Soviet Union. As I pointed out in my address to this General Assembly last year  it is extremely unfortunate for both countries that the Northern Territories issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty remain unresolved after all these years. Continuing without surcease its quest for a negotiated settlement  Japan hopes to expand and strengthen its dialog with the Soviet Union  and I hope that the Soviet Union will respond in the same spirit.In seeking true world peace  we must not neglect the need to eliminate the causes of instability. Unless this is done  we cannot possibly take the next step towards achieving world prosperity. As basic prerequisites to true peace  starvation and refugee problems must be overcome  population problems solved  and international terrorism and drug abuse curbed.In November of last year  following my participation in the General Assembly session  I visited the region of Africa that has been stricken by drought  saw for myself the tragic situation there  and issued an appeal for emergency assistance for Africa. According to the most recent report of the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa  there are still some 20 countries in Africa needing emergency assistance. Especially urgent action is needed to save the children of Africa from their terrible plight  in light of the serious effects it will have for the future of the world we live in.I regard as outstanding the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General  and the alacrity with which the United Nations moved to extend emergency aid to Africa. Japan has done everything it can to help with this aid effort. Having proposed last year that all United Nations agencies be mobilized to draw up a unified plan of action for Africa  making the most effective use of the total range of United Nations capabilities  I am gratified that the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa was established on 1 January this year and has swung into action.The Government and people of Japan feel keenly the urgent need for support for Africa. Just as the Japanese Government has extended foodstuffs and agricultural assistance worth a total of approximately $165 million between January of last year and the end of March this year  the people of Japan have joined together in an unprecedented outpouring of public support to collect over 1.7 million blankets and more than $5.8 million in individual donations of money for Africa.There is a complex combination of structural causes for this crisis of starvation and food shortfalls  and it is imperative that we respond not merely with emergency assistance but also with stepped-up co-operation with the African countries' own self-help efforts in the agricultural sector  for example  in increased food production  over the medium and long term. I am confident that a green revolution to improve agricultural yields can be achieved in Africa  as it has in Asia. It is for this reason that I have submitted my ""Green Revolution for Africa"" proposal  a comprehensive plan that would include not only agricultural research but also afforestation  and I intend to work to implement this proposal in full consultation with all the countries concerned.I remain convinced of Africa's potential for development. As stated in the declaration of the recent Organization of African Unity summit  the nations of Africa are taking the initiative to overcome the crisis facing them. The international community has a responsibility to lend them a helping hand.There are today over 10 million refugees around the world  and it is imperative that the international community take responsibility for alleviating their plight as soon as possible. In great part  these people have been displaced as the result of political problems; improving the political climate is thus the key to solving the refugee problem. At the same time  it is also important that every country lend increased support and co-operation to the efforts of the United Nations and especially the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to provide the most effective refugee relief  and move with determination to expand the scope of action available to it.Japan for its part has provided nearly $600 million in contributions to these organizations over the past five years and has increased the number of refugees accepted for resettlement in Japan. We intend to continue to do everything we can to contribute in this field.Aware of the importance of the population problem  Japan will continue its unstinting co-operation-in this field as well.Hijackings and other forms of international terrorism  and drug abuse and the illicit trafficking in narcotics  pose a threat to the peaceful lives of people everywhere. Japan  as a responsible member of the international community  intends to extend all possible co-operation to eradicate these problems. In this regard  I should like to express my support in principle for the Secretary-General's proposal that a globed conference on drug abuse be convened in 1987 Generally speaking  the economic recovery is spreading from the industrialized countries to the entire world economy. However  protectionist pressures have intensified to an unprecedented level against the background of continuing high unemployment in Europe and elsewhere  global trade and current account imbalances  and the awesome budgetary deficits member countries are facing.While the outlook is somewhat brighter for a number of developing economies  many others in Latin America and elsewhere still face such problems as stagnation of the prices for their primary commodities and accumulated debt and must continue their efforts for economic adjustment. There is thus a considerable political and social burden on them. At the same time  we should provide all possible assistance to the least-developed countries and other impoverished countries in general as they struggle to achieve economic independence.Japan realizes that no one country can pursue prosperity without regard to the quest by others for prosperity world-wide. It is determined to preserve and strengthen the free trade system and fulfill the role and responsibilities accruing from its .international position. As a manifestation of this policy  Japan  on its own initiative  formulated the Action Program for Further Improved Market Access based on the principle of free trade  permitting restrictions only in exceptional cases. We are now hard at work on its prompt and faithful implementation.Likewise  Japan believes that a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is indispensable to contain the rising tide of protectionism and promote free trade in the true sense  and has been calling for the prompt start of such a new round. It is most gratifying that the international momentum favoring this new round has increased and that the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will meet shortly to discuss matters including the scope of the negotiations. Japan will continue to do everything it can to promote the preparations for this new round and to help the negotiations start with the participation of the greatest possible number of countries  industrialized and developing alike.Japan views official-development assistance as an important international responsibility  and has twice formulated medium-term targets in a sustained effort to increase and expand such assistance. Japan intends to continue these efforts  and it was with this in mind that the third medium term target for official development assistance was just recently formulated. The aim of this ambitious program is to bring the total official development assistance disbursement for the period 1986 through 1992 to more than $40 billion. For this purpose Japan  expanding bilateral grants  multilateral assistance and yen loans  will make efforts to double the amount of official development assistance in 1992 compared to that in 1985  and to improve as much as possible the quality of its official development assistance. This third medium term target is a renewed expression of Japan's determination to play its rightful role in the international community.The development of human resources is fundamental to a nation's overall development. Realizing this  Japan has long attached importance to human resources development and placed priority on technical co-operation as central to this effort. This topic was also discussed within the context of Pacific co-operation at the Post-Ministerial Conference of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the dialog partners  in which Japan actively participated. I am pleased to report that agreement was reached at this year's meeting on the Immediate Action program for ASEAN-Pacific Co-operation on Human Resources Development. Japan intends to take an active role in the implementation of that ASEAN program.A long-time advocate of the importance of human resources development through United Nations efforts  Japan welcomes the movement within the United Nations Development program (UNDP) and other programs towards placing a higher priority on this area.In addition to continuing to co-operate with the development efforts of the South Pacific island countries  Japan intends to step up its friendly and co-operative relations with them.The North-South problem remains an important issue for the international community. However  one hopeful sign for the future is the global effort in support of Africa in which the international community truly came together. I believe that North and South must co-operate and co-ordinate their efforts and that concerted efforts between Governments and private sectors of donor countries must be encouraged. I am convinced that such efforts will contribute substantially to a solution of the North-South problem.At last year's session of the General Assembly  I spoke of Japan's determination to pursue creative diplomacy in response to the international community's expectations. Looking back on the year just past  I am acutely aware of the need for us to redouble our efforts in this direction. The times are rapidly changing and there is an increased number of situations that cannot be adequately handled with traditional approaches  means or technology. Be it the maintenance of international peace  the expansion of exchanges among countries and peoples  or the implementation of economic and technical co-operation  we need creative thinking and new approaches. The new century demands that mankind draw upon its infinite potential and bring forth new wisdom for the future.As the united Nations reaches the age of 40  we should recall the global catastrophe which led to its founding and rededicate ourselves to the cause of world peace."
"67",3686,"KEN",40,1985,"I congratulate Mr. de Pinies most warmly on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at this most important fortieth session. I wish him and the officers of the Assembly all the best in their endeavors to guide the work of the fortieth session to a successful conclusion. Let me also extend to his predecessor  the Permanent Representative of Zambia  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  our warm congratulations and appreciation for the dedication  devotion and wisdom with which he guided the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Also I wish to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and his staff for the eminent services they have continued faithfully to render to our Organization.Many distinguished speakers in the course of our deliberations have properly recalled the tragic events leading to the founding of the United Nations. At the end of the Second World War the people of the world resolved to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and on 26 June 1945 in San Francisco  at the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on International Organization  signed the Charter of the United Nations  which came into force on 24 October 1945  establishing the Organization. The Organization drew up aims and objectives for achievement as set forth in Article 1 of the Charter. As we assemble here to reflect on our achievements and shortcomings over the last four decades  I wish  on behalf of my delegation  to commend the Organization for its substantial achievements. To mention a few  the Organization has exerted every effort and has largely succeeded in  first  averting a major world conflict; secondly  promoting the course of decolonization by its adoption and implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV); thirdly  promoting respect for human rights; fourthly  adopting the declaration and program of action on the establishment of a new international economic order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States; and  fifthly  codifying international legal instruments to regulate the conduct of States in various fields  including adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention at Montego Bay  Jamaica  in 1982  which was a milestone in the history of our Organization.The lesson of the Second world war  in particular the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  should serve to remind us that war should never be a way of resolving international disputes. At this fortieth anniversary year  we should therefore rededicate ourselves fully to peace and co-operation  strictly adhering to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  the provisions of the International Covenants on Human Rights and the established norms of international law.The institutions already set up by the international community to this end and the progress achieved in the last 40 years should be further strengthened to ensure the full realization of the universality of our Organization  decolonization  disarmament  economic development and the full maintenance of international peace and security in a climate that respects the sovereignty of every nation and the dignity and worth of every individual in full freedom. In these efforts  Kenya will not be found wanting. Our national aspirations are rooted firmly in a philosophy of peace  love  unity and development which translates into a policy of positive non-alignment  good neighborliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. We wish to underscore the special responsibility that the Charter of our Organization places on the Security Council with respect to the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security. Unfortunately  the record of the Security Council in this regard has not been altogether satisfactory. There have been far too many occasions in which the abuse of the veto power by permanent members has resulted in its paralysis in the face of a number of explosive international situations. The result has been erosion of confidence in the United Nations and increasing incidents of unilateral actions contrary to the Charter. It is against the foregoing background that the record of our Organization in tackling troublesome situations needs to be reviewed.I turn now to the situation as it obtains in South Africa. The continued existence of apartheid is an obstacle to peace and security in the region. In South Africa repressive measures are taken against all those opposed to apartheid  especially the  black population. The recent declaration of a state of emergency in a number of black townships and districts arising out of opposition to apartheid is no solution but an exacerbation of the problem at hand. The escalated political riots and social violence that have gripped the country is a clear manifestation of the total rejection of apartheid perpetuated by the racist regime. The intensity and dimension of the uprisings and demonstrations is a reflection that the patience of the oppressed people has been exhausted. The regime should note that no amount of force and brutality is capable of suppressing the demand for change. The people resolutely demand nothing else but democracy  equality and justice. We in Kenya wholeheartedly support these demands. We condemn the racist regime for invoking the declaration of a state of emergency in the black townships and districts of South Africa with its ensuing brutality. We strongly believe that there can be no peace in that country until the legitimate rights and aspirations of the black people  and of South Africans as a whole  are fully respected. We continue to oppose 'the creation of bantustans  for these buttress apartheid and serve as impoverished internal bases which the racist regime uses to provoke friction and conflict within the black communities of that country.Kenya supports the liberation movements in South Africa in their struggle against oppression  exploitation and the denial of their legitimate right fully to exercise self-determination. We are deeply concerned that intensified arbitrary arrests  imprisonments without trial and tragic and brutal massacres of defenseless opponents of apartheid are the order of the day in South Africa. We reiterate and demand that apartheid be immediately dismantled  that Nelson Mandela  as well as all other political prisoners and detainees  be released unconditionally and that immediate arrangements be put forth for a constitutional conference to which all South Africans would participate to map out the future of their country.We are fully aware of the racist regime's arrogance and defiance of the will of the international community and of resolutions and decisions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. We are also aware that the racist regime uses negotiations as a camouflage while it engages in devious and dubious maneuvers calculated to entrench apartheid and give the illusion that the regime is working towards a peaceful accommodation with the oppressed inhabitants of that country  with this in mind and in order to compel South Africa to dismantle apartheid  we appeal to the Security Council to live up to the responsibilities entrusted to it and impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa as provided for in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. We demand total sanctions because apartheid is not only evil  but is also a threat to international peace and security  a crime against humanity and an affront to the very foundation of international law. The evil that apartheid is cannot be reformed. We commend those Governments and institutions which have voluntarily applied sanctions against the racist regime and those individuals who have taken positive action to pressure South Africa to abandon apartheid. We would welcome  in addition to other measures  the total cessation of the economic  military and technical co-operation that South Africa continues to receive from some Members of this Organization.With regard to the question of Namibia  United Nations efforts continue to be frustrated by the illegal occupation of the Territory by the racist regime of South Africa. Instead of cc-operating with the United Nations  the racist regime has engaged in creating futile institutions through which it hopes to thwart efforts to ensure the independence of Namibia. The international community must embark on the path of marshaling every possible means by which to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Kenya will continue to give every support to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the national liberation movement of Namibia and the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. We reject all attempts to link the independence of Namibia with extraneous and irrelevant issues.The racist regime continues to carry out acts of aggression against the independent African countries within the region  particularly Angola  Botswana  Lesotho and Mozambique. The regime engages in intimidation  destabilization  terrorism and sabotage and employs mercenaries and outright aggression against the front-line States. We condemn those activities of the racist regime and particularly the recent invasion of Angola. We are convinced that the racist regime would not be carrying out those acts without solace and support from external quarters.It is regrettable that for almost 40 years now we have been unable to settle the problems of the Middle East. The core of the conflict in the area is the plight of the Palestinian people who have been uprooted from their ancestral homes and denied the opportunity to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. The conflict continues to escalate and has engulfed the whole region.Moreover  it has become evident that countries far and near are not immune from Israeli aggression. The tragic situation in Lebanon is a case at hand. The recent Israeli raid on the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Tunis was a flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of the peace-loving African State of Tunisia. We mourn the death of the innocent women and children who lost their lives as a result of that deplorable act  which we strongly condemn. Such actions cannot be justified under international law and norms of conduct. We call upon Israel to abide by and fully implement Security Council resolution 573 (1985)  of 4 October 1985. On many occasions the international community has pronounced itself on the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by the use or threat of use of force. Kenya fully shares that view and calls upon Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied since the 1967 war.We firmly hold to the view that no nation should ever justify its own existence at the expense of others. We believe that all States in the region have an equal right to exist in peace and security and within internationally recognized and secure borders. We reiterate that no durable peace can be achieved in the area until the legitimate right of the Palestinians to self-determination and to create an independent State of their own in the region are realized.The ongoing war between Iran and Iraq is lamentable. My delegation joins others that have called on the warring parties to engage urgently in peace negotiations with a view to establishing lasting peace and security in the area.On the situation in Kampuchea  we support efforts aimed at a negotiated  peaceful settlement and reaffirm the right of the people of that country to determine their own destiny  free from external interference and intervention. It is important that all foreign troops be withdrawn.Likewise  the situation in Afghanistan has not changed. We reiterate the dire need for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and forces from that country.As regards the Korean peninsula  we are happy to note the commencement of contacts and talks between the two sides. Kenya welcomes and encourages this development in the firm belief that direct contact is the best way to reduce tension on the peninsula thus leading to a peaceful solution of the Korean question in conformity with the three principles of independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity  as set forth in the Joint North-South Statement of 4 June 1972.In Central America  tensions and conflicts continue unabated  fueled by internal and external factors. The harboring  financing and arming of dissident groups whose objective is to destabilize and overthrow legitimate Governments is not a solution to the peaceful resolution of the problems of the region  we fully support the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group and appeal to the countries and parties involved to solve their problems peacefully  in a spirit of good-neighborliness and with respect for each other's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.Since the world entered the nuclear era some years ago  the specter of self-destruction and the final annihilation of mankind has been ever present. In search of credible defense  very destructive weapons have been developed  and others far more destructive are in the making  in the name of deterrence. Several billion dollars are being expended in the manufacturing of armaments  while millions of people are wasting away every day because of poverty  disease  malnutrition and famine. Those enormous resources being squandered on arras build-up should be diverted towards alleviating the current grave socio-economic and human problems facing the world  especially the developing countries. In this connection  Kenya warmly welcomed and strongly supports the initiative which led to the decision by this Assembly to convene an International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.The resumption of the Soviet-American arms-control talks in Geneva is also an encouraging sign pointing away from the grave consequences that could lead to the total destruction of the human race by the nuclear armaments on earth and in outer space. Never before was the fate of so many dependent on the decision and action of so few. He urge the parties involved to exert the maximum political will and negotiate openly  faithfully and constructively. In the view of my delegation  such negotiations should include reliable and verifiable arrangements for security to enhance confidence  avert escalation of the armaments race and bring about reduction of the present arsenals.One of the practical measures that can be taken to strengthen international peace and security is the establishment of zones of peace in various regions of the world. This year we witnessed the endorsement of the draft South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty by countries of the region. Kenya endorses that move and considers it a positive development.Kenya fully shares the view that  in the interest of the promotion of peace  stability and co-operation in the Indian Ocean region  the first step towards the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean region is the convening of the much-awaited international conference. The conference would harmonize the viewpoints of the littoral and hinterland States of the region  the major Powers and maritime users. The success of the conference would depend largely on a firm and resolute commitment by the countries of the region  the major Powers and maritime users of the Ocean to the principles of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.With regard to Antarctica  it is imperative that activities in the area be conducted by and for the benefit of the international comBunifcy as a whole  tn this context  the initiative and the call by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries for a declaration that any and all resources in Antarctica are vested in the international community as a whole as the common heritage of mankind need to be understood and underscored. Thus all States  regardless of their size  socio-economic system or stage of development  have a legitimate interest in Antarctica and ought to have a say in the development and management of its affairs. That can and should be achieved through careful renovation of the existing treaty regime.As we approach the forty-first year since the founding of our Organization  the world economy in general remains strained by a prolonged and disastrous recession and its devastating effects which have virtually crippled the development momentum of the overwhelming majority of developing countries. Cutbacks in new investments and the suspension of long-term development projects and public programs and the slashing of expenditures in social sectors that these countries have to endure over the years of recession have taken many of them to the verge- of serious political and social upheavals. These difficulties are too deeply entrenched to be overcome easily as a by-product of recovery in a few countries.Certainly  a proliferation of protectionist policies in the industrialized countries has not made this task at all easier. Even existing commodity arrangements which have served the international community relatively well over the years are now falling apart owing to lack of political support by some of these countries. In finance  for example   apart from the uncertainty surrounding debt rescheduling  the constraints of high interest rates and inadequate flows of official development assistance  the drastic decline in international bank lending and the overall deflationary tendencies of the international monetary system have stifled any stirring of economic activity in a large number of developing countries. It is imperative for the sake of the sustained health of the world economy that growth in the developing countries be undertaken as a self-sustained and mutually reinforcing process and not merely as a by-product of growth elsewhere  because if we do not deal with the more fundamental structural problems in an adequate and equitable manner  crisis will in the end overwhelm us. We must  therefore  act seriously and with pragmatism before it is too late.It will be recalled that the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session  cognizant of the serious economic and social crisis afflicting the Africancontinent  adopted resolution 39/29 together with its annexed Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa. The African region  which today has the highest number of the least developed countries in the world  continues to be faced with  inter alia  famine and food shortages; stagnation of economic growth; unfavorable terms of trade; high rate of population growth; unemployment and underemployment; high interest rates; degradation of environment by drought and desertification; and decline in official development assistance.In reviewing the pressing problems confronting Africa  I wish to highlight the exceptionally grave situation the continent is undergoing - a situation which cannot just be described as an economic crisis  but a tragic human crisis. Fully to appreciate the dimension of the suffering  it is worth mentioning that an estimated five million children are feared to have died in 1984 alone as a result of the severe famine  while more than 150 million people were faced with the danger of serious food shortage in the same year. At the same time  per capita food production decreased by 11 per cent compared to the 1970 figures while per capita income in most African countries has been steadily declining throughout the past few years.This gloomy picture should not be allowed to pass unchecked without the international community embarking on a comprehensive plan - whether in the short or long term - to contain this dismal situation  while the African governments do recognize that the basic responsibility in arresting the crisis rests in their hands  the complexity of the crisis is such that national efforts must be complemented by international action if we are to relaunch the continent on the path of development.We in Africa have not just been sitting idle amidst the crisis. It will be recalled that as early as April 1980 the African Heads of State or Government aware of the developmental problems facing the continent  adopted the famous blueprint in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos. The Plan of Action drew up a development master plan  identifying the sequence of priorities to be followed towards the economic recovery of Africa. Recently  the African Heads of State or Government assembled once again for an economic summit Conference in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  from 18 through 20 July  where together they reviewed the implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action and came out with practical short-  medium- and long-term measures in search of a permanent solution to the problems that have plagued our continent over the years.The recommendations  embodied in the Addis Ababa Declaration  have been presented to this session of the Assembly through the Economic and Social Council. It is my earnest hope and trust that the General Assembly will consider these recommendations immediately and take prompt action. He hope that the Assembly will be unanimous in endorsing the proposal made at the summit Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to convene a special session to discuss in detail the economic and social crisis afflicting the continent and come up with some action-oriented solutions.The dramatic increase in volume of Africa's external debt and the heavy debt service burden are of serious concern to all the Member States. By the end of 1984  the total debt of all African countries was estimated to stand at $US 158 billion  and it is expected to exceed $US 170 billion by the end of this year. The total debt service as a percentage of export earnings was 19.8 per cent in 1982 and 27.4 per cent in 1983. For some countries the debt service ratio is far above this average whereas it is generally accepted that the average debt service ratio should not exceed 20 per cent of export earnings. The increasing costs of the importation of essential goods and services  especially industrialcommodities  are indispensable for accelerated economic development  of the African countries Consequently these countries are bound to continue to borrow in order to supplement their domestic resources. This constitutes one of the root causes of Africa's external debt. It is pertinent therefore to reiterate the appeal made at the OAU summit Conference that an international conference on Africa's external indebtedness be convened as a matter of urgency. This will provide a forum for the international creditors and debtors to discuss Africa's external debt with a view to arriving at appropriate emergency  short-  medium- and long-term measures to alleviate Africa's debt problems.We do appreciate that the international community has increasingly recognized the importance of seeking ways to meet the challenge that has befallen Africa. This has been reflected  for example  in resources pledged to fund a special facility for sub-Saharan Africa in the World Bank and in the substantial pledges of assistance made at the Conference on the Emergency Situation in Africa in March 1985. The response of Governments  non-governmental organizations and individuals  including artists  is commendable. Nevertheless  despite these and a number of bilateral and other commitments  projections still point to a decline in net concessional capital flows to sub-Saharan Africa over the next several years in the light of the curtailment of some flows and the increases in scheduled amortization. In the view of my delegation  this international resource mobilization effort still falls far short of the target envisaged.In the area of food and agriculture  many countries are experiencing severe losses ranging from between 25 to 30 per cent of their harvests  due in part to pest damage  poor handling and lack of storage. More than anything else  storage is the key to food increase and security. Priority by the international community should therefore be given to the development of storage facilities for the developing countries. My Government is fully determined to realize total food self-sufficiency for every Kenyan. In this connection  we are in the process of implementing our national food policy together with the recently launched District Focus for Rural Development. The District Focus  whose aim is to bring development to the people and to make the people the center for development planning  is meant to take development to the rural areas of Kenya where over 80 per cent of Kenya's population lives. Closely related to food production is industrialization. I wish to welcome the recent conversion of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) into a specialized agency. We look upon UNIIX)  the sixteenth in the family of the United Nations specialized agencies  to make its expected contribution to the industrialization process of the developing countries  in particular those of sub-Saharan Africa.I strongly believe that the objective of all development efforts is the improvement of the quality of life. In this connection  I wish to note with appreciation the efforts being made in the economic and social fields by the United Nations system  in particular the strategy being pursued by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to achieve a revolution in child survival and development and the efforts being made by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) concerning human resource development. I wish also to record my own personal appreciation and that of the Government and the people of Kenya for the commendable work that the Nairobi-based United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (HABITAT) continue to do in serving mankind in their respective areas of competence.There are mutual advantages accruing from economic co-operation between developed and developing countries and also from co-operation between developing countries. Kenya emphasizes  as a priority  co-operation between developing countries  particularly at the subregional and regional levels. The countries of eastern and southern Africa are currently engaged in the development of a Preferential Trade Area (PTA) which  in the long run  has the capacity of encompassing 23 countries with a market potential of well over 160 million people. As a littoral country  we are participants in the recently concluded Northern Corridor Transit Agreement jointly with our hinterland neighbors. We are also actively involved in the newly established Djibouti-based Inter-governmental Authority on Drought and Desertification (IGADD). In this connection  we wish to call for increased support by all Member States  both developed and developing  to promote in all possible ways efforts being taken to enhance North/South and South/ South economic co-operation.In conclusion  this fortieth anniversary year of our Organization is also the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Since these anniversaries coincide with International Youth Year whose theme is participation  development and peace  the international community should take this opportunity to renew its commitment to the welfare of youth particularly in the provision of education  training  health and employment. Youth constitute the backbone of all societies and should rightly be given the highest priority in national development. Although much has been done during International Youth Year  the events of the Year have been overshadowed by many other events. It is our expectation that a framework of concrete action-oriented future strategies for youth will be agreed upon during the United Nations World Conference for International Youth Year later at this session of the General Assembly.It will be recalled that as early as 1972 the General Assembly designated 1975 as a special year to be devoted to intensified action to promote equality between men and women  to ensure the full integration of women in the total development effort and to increase women's contribution to the strengthening of world peace. In 1975  the Assembly proclaimed 1976 to 1985 as the United Nations Decade for Women  with the themes ""Equality  Development and Peace"".The World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  which concluded in Nairobi last July  was an important milestone and indeed a rich experience for most of us. The Government and indeed the entire Kenyan people  with the co-operation of the United Nations system  did their best to facilitate a conducive conference atmosphere. I wish to take this opportunity on behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya to thank the entire international community for their co-operation  understanding and goodwill which prevailed during the Conference and which led to the adoption by consensus of the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies. We look forward to our joint efforts in implementing them. It is an honor for Africa  and indeed Kenya  that it was on our soil that the international community adopted them. This is a further affirmation of the commitment and dedication of us all to the goals  aims  purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.At this fortieth session and as we step to the next 40 years and beyond  I wish to take this opportunity on behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya to renew our confidence  commitment and dedication to the noble principles  purposes  aims and goals of the Charter of the United Nations. We wish the Secretary-General  his staff and all gathered here today all the best as we forge ahead in pursuit of world peace  security and co-operation in all our endeavors. Let nations  big and small  and people the world over  be mindful of the well-being of others in this our interdependent world. Let us foster co-operation and let justice be our shield and defender  peace and love be our prosperity. Let us all  in unity  make the world  for our present and future generations  a better place to live in."
"68",3757,"KHM",40,1985,"May I be permitted  on behalf of the Khmer people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  and on my own behalf  to express my most cordial salutations and heartfelt thanks to the heads of delegations and the representatives who honor this session with their presence  and thus give evidence of their faith in the most noble ideals of the United Nations: the ideals of justice  peace  freedom and support for oppressed peoples and victims of injustice.Mr. President  it is with great satisfaction that my delegation welcomes your unanimous election to the presidency of the fortieth session of our General Assembly. The choice made by all our colleagues is a tribute to your outstanding personality  which commands general respect  and to the sustained activities of Spain  its Sovereign and its people on behalf of peace  justice and democracy.While recalling with pleasure that Cambodia and Spain became Members of the United Nations the same year  1955  we are confident that  thanks to your long experience  wisdom and skill and to your well-known commitment to our world Organization and its Charter  our session  on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  will give a positive response to the hopes of the international community and hasten solutions to the vital issues of peace  security and justice facing our world.On behalf of my delegation  I wish to pay a warm tribute to Mr. Paul Lusaka  who conducted our work at the previous session with wisdom and distinction and prepared the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.I wish also to reaffirm our deep esteem and great appreciation for our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his outstanding activities and initiatives in order to bring about the United Nations contribution to easing tensions and maintaining peace and security in the world. His visit to South-Bast Asia earlier this year in order to explore ways and means of bringing about the implementation of the just United Nations resolutions testifies to his steady efforts  his impartiality and his courage in discharging his lofty responsibilities. His annual reports and the talks which I have had the pleasure of holding with him have all been a source of encouragement for me. Our Secretary-General is a credit to the United Nations for his personal commitment in the search for international peace and security  co-operation and understanding between all the peoples of the world.Lastly  I should like to pay a ringing tribute to our Organization as it nears the glorious day of its fortieth anniversary. The United Nations is irreplaceable  for it is the conscience of the civilized world. It is the only gathering in the world where all Powers  whatever their size  can sit as full Members  air their views freely  make suggestions  lodge complaints and voice fears to the international community and appeal to it whenever they deem their freedom  or even their existence  to be threatened.The United Nations is a prestigious Forum in which there are always those ready to uphold justice. Resolutions adopted by it  even when it does not have the material means of implementing them  have almost world-wide moral significance which nobody would challenge lightly  witness the more or less honorable or subtle maneuvers carried out by the antagonists in an attempt to save face.The United Nations remains the ultimate hope of oppressed peoples. More than once  by dint of patience  perseverance and wisdom  it has changed the course of history. It goes without saying that we whole-heartedly desire it to succeed in the case of our unfortunate Kampuchea  attacked  invaded and more than half-colonized by a much more powerful imperialist neighbor.The United Nations  which had 51 Members when it was founded in 1945  had 159 Members last year - a figure that will surely be exceeded in the years to come. We can thus rightly speak of the universality of our Organization - and I shall just recall that Cambodia has been a member since 1955  and Viet Nam since 1977.On 31 May last year  the Secretary-General made the following statement:""To me  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provides a further occasion ... to encourage a rededication by Member States to the principlesand purposes of the Charter... ""...Last  but not least  may I express the fervent hope that every effort will be made to have the year 1985 stand out laudably as a year of peace  conflict resolution  restraint  international co-operation and friendship among nations. This would be the way of transforming an anniversary into a celebration. ""I refer here above all to the frightening course taken by the arms race  as well as to several protracted unresolved conflict's."" (Press Release SG/SM-3563  pp. 1  3)We hope that the wishes expressed by the Secretary-General will be fulfilled in this memorable year. For its part  my delegation will spare no effort to help in this and sincerely hopes that our adversary from the Bast will show the same sense of responsibility and desire for harmony and peace.In a resolution of 17 December 1984 the General Assembly took the following decision:""that the theme of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations shall be 'United Nations for a better world' and expresses the hope and desire that the year 1985 will mark the beginning of an era of durable and global peace and justice  social and economic development and progress and independence of all peoples."" (resolution 39/161 A  para. 1)Lastly  a decision adopted on 11 April 1935 by the Preparatory Committee for the Fortieth Anniversary of the United Nations stated:""The general debate should be held as usual for a three-week period  from 23 September to 11 October  on the clear and explicit understanding that statements made by Heads of State or Government and special envoys during that period will also be considered as part of the commemoration."" (A/40/49  p. 11) The United Nations aim for the present session is therefore that all Governments and peoples should make this anniversary an occasion for reaffirming their faith in the goals and principles of the Charter.On 24 October  1986 will be declared the ""International Year of Peace"". This constitutes for the Khmer people - the most unfortunate of all - the last recourse in the ocean of suffering and humiliation on which it has tossed for so many years.The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the USSR  which supports it against our people  must agree to prove themselves worthy of membership in the United Nations and respect its resolutions and its Charter. If they were not to do so  what would be the future of my people and other peoples victims of injustice and what would be the prospects for world peace  which is the greatest ambition of all peoples?We Khmers have never concealed our eager desire to seek an equitable and honorable political solution to the differences which pit us against our Vietnamese neighbors and their Khmer proteges in Phnom Penh.Quite recently  our friends from the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) - whose great goodwill I salute here - with the support of our Coalition Government  proposed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam the holding of proximity talks  with the possibility of the Khmer authorities in Phnom Penh being represented in the Hanoi delegation. Our proposals and those of our ASEAN friends met with a flat refusal. Viet Nam and its proteges in Phnom Penh  backed by the Soviet Union  have rejected all our proposals for peace  conciliation and guarantees put forward  in particular  in my statements at the United Nations in 1983 and 1984.Viet Nam is now making a lot of fuss about what it calls the progress achieved in the process of a political settlement of the question of South-East Asia and the problem of Kampuchea and is apparently asking the international community not to thwart this process. But this is just a new false maneuver designed to extricate it from the growing isolation in which it finds itself and avoid being condemned yet again by our Assembly  which since 1979 has never ceased to call for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea so that our people can freely decide their own destiny. Today  as can be seen from many statements made from this rostrum by representatives of States Members of the Organization  the international community continues to hold firmly to this just position and to call earnestly for Viet Nam to put an end to its aggression against Kampuchea. Today more than ever before countries which love peace and justice are well aware that Viet Nam's objective is to absorb Kampuchea into the ""Indo-China Federation"" under Hanoi domination.The fact is that  being unable to impose its fait accompli in Kampuchea by force of arms  Viet Nam is trying to do so through diplomatic maneuvers  the cynicism and effrontery of which consist in arrogating to itself the right to speak and act as a master in the name of the so-called Indo-China.While waiting for a solution to be envisaged  if not found  which would lead us out of this tragic impasse that brings more ruin and devastation to our country every year  every month and almost every day  thus increasing the suffering of our people and the loss of life  our resistance against the occupiers has not been seriously weakened - as claimed by Hanoi and Phnom Penh - by the so-called big victories of the Vietnamese offensive during the dry season of December 1984 to March 1985. The tactics that we have carried out ever since then in the form of many daring commando actions deep into the interior of the zones occupied by the enemy and up to the approaches to Phnom Penh have caused the most serious concern to the occupiers and their Khmer proteges.In this connection  I shall quote not unilateral military communiques that would give rise to suspicion but the testimony of independent  unbiased Western journalists  all the more reliable in that they do not come from the supporters of our Coalition Government.With the Assembly's permission  I shall quote in chronological order.The Washington Post  Thursday  April 25  1985:""William Branigin: 'The Cambodian Quagmire - Vietnam's Vietnam?' Excerpts: 'Instead of the Americans  the Vietnamese are now the foreign troops fighting dedicated guerrillas... Gen. Tran Cong Man  the editor of the [Vietnamese] Army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said: 'There are some complicated problems in Cambodia that must be settled...' That the Vietnamese are having problems can be discerned between the lines of statements such as the article by Gen. Anh in December [1984] in the [Vietnamese] Army theoretical journal. Anh  who is reportedly in charge of military operations in Cambodia  laid surprising emphasis on the need to improve security in the interior [of Cambodia]. He wrote that ... Cambodian guerrillas had 'set up logistical bases ... for guerrilla and sabotage activities  seizing lands  controlling the population  building counterrevolutionary forces and so forth'. Ultimately  Anh ... cautioned that 'the struggle is still long and complicated...' The [North] Vietnamese are locked in another war with no light at the end of the tunnel... ""United Nations recognition of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  which is supported by the United States  is based on the principle that... the Vietnamese invasion and continued occupation of Cambodia represent a violation of international law that cannot be tolerated... The guerrillas are proving hard to eradicate and the 'Vietnam War' analogies persist.""Despite a successful offensive against the guerrillas along the Thai-Cambodian border starting in November  there are indications that security generally has deteriorated lately amid mounting guerrilla activity in the Cambodian interior.""Correspondents who have visited Cambodia this month have confirmed guerrilla attacks within 20 miles of the capital  and Cambodian refugees arriving at the border with Thailand have reported an upsurge of incidents in various districts of the interior in the past two months. 'The level of guerrilla activity inside Cambodia right now is as high as it has ever been' since the Vietnamese invasion  said a senior Western diplomat in Bangkok... Since the Vietnamese dry-season offensive forced them out of their strongholds near the Thai-Cambodian border earlier this year  'the [guerrillas] have done what they said they were going to do'  the diplomat said. Taking advantage of a vacuum in the interior that developed when the Vietnamese were concentrating on the border  'the [guerrillas] have been hitting district capitals and provincial seats practically all over the country'  he said  but particularly in the western provinces of Battambang and Siemreap. 'Clearly the [guerrillas] are giving the Vietnamese a great deal of difficulty'  the diplomat said.""According to an Australian correspondent who recently visited Cambodia  one Khmer [guerrilla] attack during his stay occurred March 26 in the former capital of Oudong  about 25 miles north of Phnom Penh on Highway 5. He said about 100 guerrillas destroyed a Vietnamese motor pool in the center of town  blew up a bridge on the northern outskirts  ambushed a Vietnamese convoy of several trucks and killed about 15 Vietnamese troops.""The guerrillas also entered the town market... they called the town's people to a political meeting before evacuating  he reported.""Throughout the attack  he said  a post occupied by Cambodian soldiers of the Heng Samrin government was left alone  and the troops made no attempt to interfere.""According to Western diplomats in Bangkok  similar attacks are not unusual in other parts of Cambodia these days...""According to an investigation late last year by the New York-based Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights  the People's Republic of Kampuchea now appears... as a human rights violator. 'The rule of law is not respected in any serious sense in the People's Republic of Kampuchea'  the group concluded in a December 1984 report. 'For the hundreds or perhaps thousands of political prisoners who inhabit its jails  beatings are commonplace and more sophisticated forms of torture usual.'... There is a growing popular resentment of the presence of an estimated 160 000 to 180 000 Vietnamese troops and increasing numbers of Vietnamese settlers.""Specifically  Cambodian peasants lately have especially resented being dragooned by the Vietnamese into forced-labor teams and sent to the Thai-Cambodian border to build a network of road and defensive barriers  according to Western relief workers in Cambodia. The network is aimed at improving Vietnamese logistics in the border area and preventing guerrilla infiltration. The Vietnamese have acknowledged mobilizing 'tens of thousands' of Cambodians for the construction work...""One side effect of the project  said one relief official  has been the spread of a resistant strain of malaria  common along the border  to workers from other provinces. 'The forced labor and the malaria have caused a lot of animosity towards the Vietnamese'  the official said. 'The Vietnamese have gained a lot militarily in the border area  but the toll has been very heavy in terms of the health of Cambodians'.""An influx of settlers also has raised indignation and suspicion among some Cambodians that crowded Vietnam  with a population of 60 million to Cambodia's estimated 6 million  which has expansionist designs on its potentially bountiful neighbor.""Recent visitors to Cambodia have reported seeing Vietnamese settlers who clearly were newcomers and who spoke no Khmer  the name of the language and ethnic group of the Cambodian majority.""While many of the Vietnamese may cross into Cambodia on their own from southern Viet Nam in search of economic opportunities  some apparently benefit from government support.""One Cambodian barber in Phnom Penh told a visitor recently  for example  that he had been obliged to take on a Vietnamese partner to get back the shop he had been forced to abandon...""Another Cambodian shopkeeper told an Italian correspondent in a southern suburb of Phnom Penh that 20 to 30 Vietnamese a day were arriving in trucks to take up residence there. While they were talking  the reporter witnessed the arrival of one such truck.""A Western relief agency official who lived in Phnom Penh a few years ago said after a recent return trip that he was 'amazed' at the number of new Vietnamese settlers he saw. 'The traders of farm produce tend to be Vietnamese  nor Khmer anymore'  he said. 'People are very angry about it said another recent visitor of the Cambodians he met. 'They talk about the Vietnamese more and more'-  ""Le Monde  8 May 1985: The Vietnamese at grips with the guerrillas  by Philippe Pons. Excerpts:""The Vietnamese now have to cope with a type of war which - they know better than anyone else - war machines can hardly break down  namely  guerrilla warfare... As a substitute for the 'Maginot Line  this Vietnamese-style 'Berlin Wall'  composed of ditches and slopes for the construction of which Hanoi has rounded up Cambodians from all over the country  actually appears relatively easy to get around. It seems that the Vietnamese no longer control strategic points  a fact that already necessitates a massive deployment of their forces... The Vietnamese and the regime in Phi saenh are far from being the masters of the country... Today the Vietnamese have won only a partial victory: they have expelled the civilian populations from the bases along the border  but they have failed to subdue the resistance. Quite the contrary  it appears as if they have contributed to strengthening the (Democratic Kampuchea tripartite] alliance... The Vietnamese diplomatic isolation has worsened... Hanoi... runs the risk of getting bogged down in a long and expensive conflict  (spoke in English)""Far Eastern Economic Review  9 May 1985: 'The war continues. Hanoi has wiped out the key Khmer resistance bases  but the guerrillas are increasingly active inside the country'  by Rodney Tasker. Excerpts:""Latest reports suggest that widespread fighting deeper inside Cambodia has reached a new level of intensity... The [guerrillas] have spearheaded aJ resistance campaign to carry out almost daily attacks on Vietnamese troops  sabotaging lines of communication and hitting administrative centers... •After talking to dozens of Cambodians [refugees at the Thai border] from almost all the provinces  I am convinced that fighting is worse than it's ever been [since Vietnam's late 1978 invasion]'  the source commented... ""Independent sources tend to confirm that the [guerrillas] are indeed very active carrying out sabotage operations to within 10 kilometers of Phnom Penh. One Australian international relief worker based in Phnom Penh gave an eye-witness confirmation of a Khmer [guerrilla] raid on the town of Oudong  30 kilometers north-west of Phnom Penh  on 26 March  an attack which has since been confirmed to the Review by other independent sources  who also say the Khmer [guerrillas] successfully ambushed a squad of reinforcements rushed to the scene. He said the Khmer [guerrillas] claim that they killed 20 Vietnamese troops and destroyed military posts and other buildings was largely accurate. The relief worker said he and his colleagues in Phnom Penh were now 'severely restricted in traveling by land outside the capital'. Other sources confirmed that driving from Phnom Penh north to Kompong Chhnang  Kompong Cham and Kompong Thorn had become a dangerous exercise because of guerrilla activities and that the authorities often prevented such travel  and if they did  movement was restricted to daylight hours. According to diplomatic and other sources  an official Mongolian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Mangalyn Dugersuren arrived in Phnom Penh in March  having been told that part of the visit would include a flight to the historic Angkor Wat temples. But when they arrived  the party was told the Angkor Wat trip had been canceled 'for their own safety'. Other reports speak of burned-out trucks strewn along some of the main highways in Cambodia and frequent disruption of rail services because of guerrilla sabotage attacks. A ferry operating on the southern estuary of the Tonle Sap  or great lake  was reportedly destroyed by guerrillas in January ... Independent sources generally agree that the [guerrillas] were by no means crippled militarily by the successful Vietnamese campaign to deprive them of their border sanctuaries ... The bulk of the [Democratic Kampuchea guerrillas] simply melted away in their normal small units of no more than 10 men to continue the guerrilla campaign inside Cambodia ... The Vietnamese appear to be paying the price of concentrating their best occupation troops in an effort to seal the Cambodian-Thai border and deprive the resistance of any sanctuary there. The price is weaker security in the Cambodian interior  a soft underbelly which the [guerrillas] are exploiting."" ""Le Monde  Wednesday  17 April 1985; James Burnett; Excerpts:""It is conceded in Phnom Penh that 'kicking over [by the Vietnamese army] the anthill [of the Khmer resistance]' has not solved all the problems. Far from it. The plan now is to neutralize groups of resistance fighters scattered all over the country. A tough job ... And people know the danger is very real ... The threat of an 'enemy assault' on Phnom Penh was taken seriously. Vietnamese advisers kept plying the Cambodian authorities with security directives. Security measures in the capital's market places and the 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew  which had been in force for the past five years  were tightened up. It has been learned from Khmer sources that there have been growing numbers of arrests in the capital  Phnom Penh ... Westerners have been discreetly dissuaded from visiting markets. When Mr. Hun Sen recently received representatives of humanitarian organizations  he told them he feared one of their members might have been killed or taken hostage. The 2 000 or so Soviet experts in the country move around only by helicopters in rural areas.""""United Press International  Bangkok  8 August 1985; Excerpts:""The Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh is pressing civilians into guard duty and tightening security in the face of increased guerrilla attacks  according to an official Cambodian report ... Civilians throughout Phnom Penh are to join regular army and militia units in 'vigorously performing patrol and guard duties  particularly during the curfew hours  in the streets  along the rivers and major communication lines and at entries and exits of the city to contribute to the safety of important party and State targets'  the official report said. The report obtained by United Press International was the first indication that civilian guards and tightened road surveillance have been added to Phnom Penh's long-standing dusk-to-dawn curfew. Western diplomats confirmed that the internal security of Cambodia .is deteriorating  which is raising the concerns of 160 000 Vietnamese occupation troops and the Hanoi-installed Heng Samrin regime in Phnom Penh. 'The situation is at its worst since the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in December 1978'  said one Western diplomat. 'The guerrillas have penetrated deeply and are operating throughout the country  including the Phnom Penh area ...'. Confirmed guerrilla raids have occurred this year in districts near Phnom Penh ..."". (continued in French)I would add  for the information of representatives  that I had the honor to receive last August in Kampuchea's free zone  representatives of foreign media and television  and two ambassadors from friendly nations who presented their credentials to me.Following this information on the military situation in Kampuchea  I now have the duty to take up the most important subject of the systematic and increasingly serious violations of human rights of which the Heng Samrin and Hun Sen regime and its Vietnamese protectors are guilty. May I quote again  in this respect  some testimonies of fully reliable independent investigators  I shall first quote excerpts from a Washington Associated Press report from The Japan Time of Friday  14 December 1984.""The Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights said a delegation it sent to Kampuchea in November found evidence that 'for the hundreds or perhaps thousands of political prisoners who inhabit [Kampuchean] jails  beatings are commonplace and more sophisticated forms of torture usual'. The report directed its sharpest criticism at the People's Republic of Kampuchea ... The Lawyers Committee concluded that 'beatings - with truncheons  metal pipes or rifle stocks - appear to be the most common form of torture'  but that more sophisticated methods involving electric shocks  and metal vises for the head are sometimes used. 'Persons suspected of supporting resistance activity are typically arrested without charges being made  imprisoned without being sentenced or convicted  and kept in jail for indeterminate periods'  the report said. The New York-based Lawyers Committee said its three-member delegation was the first human rights team to visit Kampuchea  as Cambodia is now known  in at least 15 years. The delegation cited what it called a 'pervasive reluctance' in the international community to examine current Kampuchean human rights abuses.""The following are excerpts that appeared in The Canberra Times of Friday  14 December 1984:""The Vietnamese-backed Government of Kampuchea routinely and brutally torture political prisoners  a United States human rights group said yesterday. A report by the New York-based Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights said  'The rule of law is not respected in any serious sense in the People's Republic of Kampuchea' ... Beatings with truncheons  metal pipes or rifle stocks appeared to be the most common form of torture. Beatings were often supplemented with prisoners being suspended from ceilings  given electric-shock treatment  having plastic bags put over their heads  having powdered lye blown in their faces  and having metal contraptions tightened around their heads. Prisoners  estimated to number in the thousands  were often kept for months in windowless cells and forbidden to make any comment about the Vietnamese presence in their country  not even to cite it in their 'confessions'.""In The New York Times of Thursday  15 November 1984  there is an article entitled ""Hanoi linked to Cambodian torture"" by Barbara Crossette  dated from Bangkok  Thailand  14 November:""A visiting American civil rights group says that Vietnamese Government officials are widely involved in the arrest and torture of Cambodian citizens ... 'In Cambodia  there simply does not exist the recognition of civil liberties or human rights on a basis recognized by the world community ' said Floyd Abrams  the constitutional expert and First Amendment lawyer  who is a member of the American team ... 'When you put together a society ' Mr. Abrams said in an interview on Tuesday  'in which people are arrested without charges being made and jailed without being convicted  in which confessions are forced and torture seems to be commonplace  you simply are not talking about a society that seriously recognizes the rule of law.' ... Vietnamese are playing an extensive role in the security apparatus of the Phnom Penh Government. Vietnamese were reported present o- actively taking part in every interrogation and torture ... Torture methods  according to former prisoners  included electric shocks  being trussed up and suspended from the ceiling while being beaten  being shackled by the legs to stirrups above the floor to force the body into a painful off-balance position and having a plastic bag pulled over the head and closed around the neck until the prisoner fainted. Some prisoners reportedly died of beatings  others from malnutrition and disease."" In the Far Eastern Economic Review on 26 August 1985 there is an article entitled ""Cambodia: forced human bondage"" by John McBeth in San Ro Changan which reads:""From Rattanakiri and Preah Vihear provinces in the North and North East to Pursat in the West  tens of thousands of Cambodians are being pressed intonational defense work - a euphemism for an ambitious Vietnamese plan to seal the ""Shai-Kaspuchea border ... Diplomats ... have confirmed the reports ... h Khmer doctor who recently defected from Phnom Penh claims each of Cansbodia' s provinces is committed to supplying up to 25 000 to 30 000 workers over an unspecified period of time to build and repair access roads  clear jungle  lay minefields  and construct elaborate anti-infiltration barriers along the malaria-infested frontier. Conscripts range in age from 18 to 45 and there is general agreement that quotas have been established for each district  ranging as high as 3 000 ... Disease is apparently so rampant that many of the medical workers themselves go down with malaria  hepatitis and viral infections and are unable to work for weeks after their return ... The death rate among the labor conscripts is unknown but diplomatic sources say many are wounded by mines ... Medical supplies are also reported to be inadequate to deal with the sick  the bulk of whom contract malaria on top of other complaints ... So Saren  former deputy director of Phnom Penh's 500-bed Kampuchean-Soviet Friendship Hospital  said the forced labor program was initiated in March 1984 ... So claimed opposition to the labor program is muted but widespread. Western aid workers and other independent sources confirm what they say is a tremendous amount of bitterness over the Vietnamese-directed plan  particularly the way women are being conscripted to make up the work force quotas. One of the more prominent critics  according to So  was the regime's late Prime Minister  Chan Sy  who is said to have complained to the Vietnamese that it would lead to an unacceptable number of deaths. Sy is reported to have died of a heart or circulatory ailment in a Moscow hospital last December.""In The New York Times of 26 August 1985  Barbara Crossette says:""Cambodian refugees reaching Thailand have said civilians are also being used as 'human mine detectors'. & staff director of Cambodia's National Military Training School said recently that what he called 'manual' mine detection was being carried out along the border.""The following are excerpts from the 1984 report of Amnesty International  pages 231 and 232:""Amnesty International's main concern was the reported detention without trial by the authorities of the People's Republic of Kampuchea of people they suspected of opposing their policies or of supporting groups engaged in armed resistance against them ... In July 1983  refugees arriving at camps near the western border reported that widespread arrests had taken place in the army and administration of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and among the peasants ... Starting in April 1983  300 people were reportedly arrested in the western provinces of Simreap  Oddar Meanchey and Battambang. Among them were said to be Chan Seng  the Governor of Siemreap province  Keo Ha  his former deputy  as well as military officers  teachers and village cadres ... Villagers were reportedly arrested during the year 1983 for protesting against arrests  military conscription and forced relocation. Further arrests of government officials were reported in October and December 1983 in Karapot and Kompong Cham provinces. Amnesty International had no information on the reasons for these arrests. Refugees from western provinces also reported the arrest  ill-treatment and torture in June 1983 of villagers by Vietnamese soldiers present in the country who suspected them of helping the armed operation of the guerrillas. Amnesty International was unable to estimate the number of people detained on political grounds Among the individual cases it investigated was that of Mao Ayauth  a former-television and radio producer who was working in the Government's information service and was reportedly detained in 1381. Amnesty International learned of the release at the end of 1982 of Nam Bunnaraya  Director of the orchestra of - the Kampuchean radio  after 18 months detention without charge or trial. Most political detainees were believed to be detained without charge or trial ... Amnesty International was concerned about reports that some of the prisoners held in the Central Prison in Phnom Penh  were kept in fetters and in unlit cells  especially during their period of interrogation. Detention for 're-education' purposes without charge or trial appeared to be widespread ... In June 1983  the Phnom Penh authorities confirmed that more than 100 were being detained in a camp in Takeo  some having been held for up to three years."" (continued in French)The testimony I have just quoted is more than alarming. It shows that the Heng Samrin and Hun Sen regime  which is desperately trying to present its best possible image to those few visitors from the free world  has been unable to deceive their vigilance and shrewdness. We can see that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam encourages torture when it does not engage in the practice itself. Not only do the two acolyte regimes regard as worthless the United Nations mottoes and slogans on peace  tolerance  conciliation and co-operation among peoples and nations  but they are endangering everything that provides guarantees for the dignity of human beings.The violation of human rights  the suppression of fundamental freedoms  the absence of any serious judicial procedures  the common practice of torture  the recourse to political assassination  all these constitute an extremely serious threat to those rights which the United Nations has the duty to protect at all costs. This accumulation of crimes against humanity by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and its proteges in Phnom Penh obviously removes all justification for the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia.The United Nations Charter  human rights and international law are treated with contempt by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  endorsed and supported by the Soviet Union and some 20 countries in its orbit and that will  alas  tarnish the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and the International Year of Peace in 1986.We are therefore confident that our Organization will do its utmost to discharge its responsibilities more fully in maintaining peace  and that in this field it will not only strengthen the role of our Assembly but also the office of the Secretary-General  in order to make his admirable diplomacy still more efficient.We trust that resolutions adopted by our Assembly designed to put an end to foreign occupation and to restore peace will be implemented more effectively than they have been so far.The people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  who have been waging for almost seven years a resolute and strenuous struggle to regain the independence of their homeland and their right to self-determination  always support the peoples of all continents who are fighting for the same ideals. On this occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and its Charter  we should like solemnly to renew our unswerving solidarity and support.First  we renew our firm and cordial solidarity with our brothers and sisters of Laos  who are waging a strenuous and brave struggle for the survival of their motherland and national identity against Viet Nam's absorption.Second  we support the patriotic and realistic proposal put forward by President Kim II Sung to hold parliamentary talks between the National Assemblies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of South Korea so as to ease tensions in the peninsula  put an end to mistrust and confrontation  and create a climate conducive to mutual understanding and confidence for a peaceful and independent reunification of Korea. The meetings and talks between the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of South Korea concerning economic and parliamentary affairs and questions relating to the Red Cross have already achieved encouraging results  which augurs well for further progress towards the peaceful reunification of Korea. We trust that those meetings and talks will continue to develop favorably for the good of the whole Korean people and nation.Third  we renew our fraternal support for and solidarity with the valiant Afghan people and the heroic Mujahideen  who are waging a struggle similar to ours; we express our profound admiration to them and our warm congratulations for their outstanding victories against the Soviet forces of aggression and occupation. Certainly  the Afghan people will never allow themselves to be subdued and the only solution to the Afghan problem remains the total withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan so that the Afghan people can exercise their right to self-determination and decide themselves on their form of government and political  economic and social system  without foreign interference in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.Fourth  in the Middle East  a just and lasting peace cannot be established without the recognition and exercise of the Palestinians' right to self-determination  the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of foreign territories by force  and the right of all States in the region to coexist in peace and security. He continue to support the struggle of the Arab countries and that of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the PLO to achieve this goal. The terrorist acts that follow one on another make it increasingly difficult to solve the problem. We condemn all of them  particularly the one that occurred yesterday at Tunis against the headquarters of the PLO  which was in addition a violation of Tunisian sovereignty. We hope that the current efforts to bring the parties concerned to the conference table will prove fruitful so that this commemorative year of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will be the starting point of a settlement of the Palestinian problem and that of the Middle East  which have already lasted all too long.Fifth  the situation in Lebanon  which cannot be dissociated from the situation in the Middle East  continues to be a matter of concern to the international community. We sincerely hope that national harmony can be restored so as to ensure peace and security in the country  safeguard national independence and unity and ensure territorial integrity.Sixth  the war between the two neighboring and brotherly countries  Iran and Iraq  has continued unabated for over five years  with a heavy toll in human lives and material resources for both sides. We urge the two countries to listen to the appeals of the international community  to put an end to this bloodshed and to start negotiations for a peaceful settlement of this conflict.Seventh  our support for and solidarity with the African liberation movements remains unchanged  especially with respect to the courageous and legitimate struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  for their national independence in a united Namibia including Walvis Bay and the coastal islands. The brutal repression of the Namibian people and the establishment by the apartheid regime in Pretoria of a so-called interim government in Namibia  are aimed only at perpetuating the illegal occupation of Namibia  in violation of United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)  which remain the only valid basis for a peaceful  just and lasting settlement of the problem of decolonialization of Namibia. Tension in southern Africa will continue to worsen as long as the Pretoria regime refuses to give up its policy of apartheid  its illegal occupation of Namibia  and its aggression against and destabilization of neighboring countries. Slaughter  arrests  and arbitrary mass detentions which have been taking place since the imposition of the state of emergency in South Africa have aroused the indignation and condemnation of the whole international community. They show that the apartheid regime cannot be reformed and that only its elimination can bring about the establishment of a free  united and democratic society in South Africa. We welcome the sanctions adopted by developed countries against the Pretoria regime. Those sanctions  which should undoubtedly be more stringent  in combination with increased moral  material and diplomatic assistance to the just struggle of the South African peoples  are likely to induce the defenders of apartheid to listen to reason.Eighth  the persistent drought  coupled with the catastrophic phenomena of desertification and compounded by external economic factors  continue to claim tens of millions of victims in Africa. We wish to reaffirm our solidarity with and our admiration for all the African peoples and Governments who are struggling with courage  tenacity and dignity to cope with this unprecedented economic and social crisis. The people of Kampuchea  a small and impoverished country  a victim of the VietnamesG genocidal war of aggression  feel part of and are deeply affected by the misfortunes and sufferings of their African brothers and sisters. They will continue to offer their very modest contributions to the commendable efforts of our Secretary-General and the international community to alleviate those sufferings. We congratulate all those countries that have granted emergency assistance to the victX^.  and have provided manifold forms of aid to the African programs of action at the national and regional levels  with a view to finding a long-term structural solution to the crisis. They have responded positively to their international responsibility  a responsibility which falls to us all as human beings. They have shown that  united  we can successfully take up this tragic challenge  involving a whole continent.Ninth   and last  we consider that the Contadora group is the best instrument to resolve the crisis in Central America by peaceful means  and to restore peace and stability on the basis of respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region.The recent setting up by four important Latin American countries of a group in support of the Contadora Group will not fail to give a new impetus to its action so as to prevent the situation in the region from dangerously deteriorating  and it will help to realize its noble objectives. We continue to lend our support and encouragement to the Contadora Group.The appalling natural calamity  which plunges Mexico into mourning  has upset the international community by its exceptional size. On this painful occasion  I would like  on behalf of the people of Kampuchea and their coalition Government  and on my own behalf  to assure the Mexican Government and the valiant people of Mexico of our profound sympathy and sincere condolences."
"69",3799,"KNA",40,1985,"Seeing you  Mr. President  seated in pride of place presiding over this  the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly  only serves to convince me that the appropriate conduct of this session has been comfortably placed in your very capable hands  blessed as you are with years of experience.It is difficult to over-emphasize the historical link forged by the voyages and explorations of the renowned navigator Cristobal Colon between your country and the new world  of which my country forms an integral part.I should therefore like to take this opportunity on behalf of the delegation of Saint Christopher and Nevis to add my congratulations to those hitherto expressed to you  Sir  and to your country as you continue to superintend and administer these proceedings with your usual consummate skill and innate dexterity.I must also hasten to pay tribute to and voice full appreciation of the inestimable importance of sessions such as this one to the realization and preservation of international peace  functional co-operation  economic security  respect for the dignity of peoples and the sovereignty of States  however small.In this context  the people of Saint Christopher and Nevis are proud of their emergence from colonialism into the brotherhood of the United Nations. I bring fond greetings from our Prime Minister  Dr. Kennedy Alphonse Simmonds  who has swiftly and brilliantly spearheaded our transition from colonial dependence to international independence.I should like at this stage to extend the sympathy and condolences of the Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis to the Government and the people of Mexico on their recent tragic experiences. We who live in an area which is annually threatened by hurricanes fully understand the sense of helpless shock experienced by persons confronted with the devastation of a natural disaster of this magnitude.Our nation is comprised of the islands of Saint Christopher and Nevis  also called St. Kitts and Nevis  and we are located in the Caribbean  to the south-east of Puerto Rico  near the United States and the British Virgin Islands  near the Dutch colonies of St. Eustatius and Saba  the French island of St. Bartholomew  French and Dutch St. Maarten and the British colonies of Anguilla and Montserrat.It is perhaps because of this geographic situation that our people are quick to understand the significance of a multilateral approach to issues.We inherited the colonial problems of the monoculture of sugar  but despite limitations of size  economic vulnerability and the vagaries of weather  we  have made significant developmental strides during our first two years of independence. Indeed  we have established the basis for economic diversification and a better way of life for all our people.Within. days of our birth as a free nation  we gained admission to this body  and this signifies our recognition of the fact that in an age of considerable turmoil  the United Nations with its body of collaborating Member States continues to play a leading role in the pursuit and retention of a more peaceful  more organized and more contented world.Of particular significance to us is the question of the multilateral approach to the security of small States and the establishment of order in the exploitation of the resources of the sea.We who believe in peace must not be dominated by those who believe in force. We who are committed to the lofty ideals of CARICOM  the Caribbean Community  must never allow any of our member States to be manipulated and destabilized by external pressures. This applies to the political pressure of power politics  the economic maneuvers of industrialized society or the conspiracy of those who would destroy our population by trafficking in Illegal drugs.We have signed the Law of the Sea Convention. As a nation of islands  our people look to the surrounding seas in their effort to achieve a comfortable existence. We have to ensure that no one be allowed to deplete the resources of our maritime economic zone. We have to be able to develop fully and peacefully the economic utilization of the sea-bed and the resources of the seas above.Our Constitution faithfully follows the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was created specifically to suit our particular situation as a twin island State  and we addressed all the issues of fundamental rights and freedoms  ensuring the rights of all  including our women and children.However  constitutional postulation alone cannot ensure the creation of a just society. The Government and the people of Saint Christopher and Nevis continue to have at home a peace  justice and human rights record which demonstrates that they fully and truly identify with and live up to the purposes and principles of the Charter o"" the United Nations. We have taken many mixtures of race and made them one; we have earned the classification of the freest nation on earth.With this setting at home  it is with revulsion and shock that we face the distasteful and despicable situation in South Africa. Our Prime Minister has praised France for placing an embargo on new French investments in South Africa  praised the United States Congress for recommending economic sanctions against the dictatorial white minority Government  called vociferously on the international community represented by the United Nations to take a principled stand against apartheid  appealed for an end to the state of emergency and the wanton murder and oppression of the black people of South Africa  and demanded that the people of Namibia and Angola be allowed to enjoy their hard-earned right to freedom and independence.We are deeply concerned at the prolonged starvation in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa  and we view with alarm the decision that we in the Caribbean should graduate from international development assistance loans on the basis of per capita income. One is forced to conclude that developed countries are galvanized into action by crisis  hunger and starvation.There is a fundamental need for economic preventive medication and there is clearly a dire need for a total reassessment of the present international economic order  as it is evident that the present criteria work manifest injustice on small nations.The amount that must be expended on infrastructure by a small nation is much greater  in proportion to its income  than the amount that must be expended by a large nation. To reduce this to simplicity  a small country and a large country may require the same sized airport to enable the same sized aeroplanes to operate. There is clearly a need for us to address this issue swiftly if we are not to create undue hardship for countries faced with the problem of markets being closed by the industrialized nations. We intend to raise in every forum the need for improved infrastructure facilities  more trade  assistance in the form of training and equipment  and co-ordinated public and private-sector investment.St. Kitts and Nevis has given practical expression to this policy by privatizing its telecommunications system. The system is now owned by a corporation whose shareholders are Cable and Wireless and the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. This concept of joint venture is being implemented in other fields of investment  including dairy farming  cotton production and processing  and communications.Regional organizations have their part to play within the international framework. It is of supreme importance to the vigor and vitality of the global framework of the United Nations that such regional bodies as the Organization of American States be sustained in full bloom. The Organization of American States proudly represents the interests of the United states of America  the countries of Central and South America and the French-  Spanish-  Dutch- and English-speaking Caribbean nations. It is highly undesirable that such an invaluable organization  critical to the maintenance and upkeep of development through peace  should be at present languishing on the sick-bed of financial constraints imposed by the unwillingness of the more affluent member States to live up to hitherto agreed contributions. This of necessity must have a negative impact on cat program of technical and cultural development.One hopes that this most auspicious year of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will also mark a commitment on the part of nations to encourage the revitalization of the Organization of American States  not in terms of empty rhetoric but through an active demonstration of financial commitment and support.Equally  such renewed commitment is required to the revitalization and strengthening of the various agencies of the United Nations which bring much-needed educational  cultural and technical assistance to developing countries.We are pleased to learn of the ongoing dialog between North and South Korea  and we hope that we will soon see negotiations in relation to areas where other disputing peoples have a similarity of race and history  in the Far East  in the Middle East and in Central America. As the United Nations is celebrating its fortieth anniversary  it is timely for it to take a significant step towards the complete realization of the principle of universality by admitting both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as Members of the Organization. We believe that the admission of both nations as Members of the United Nations 'could make a positive contribution to the reduction of tension on the Korean peninsula and thus to the promotion of international peace and security.In this age of the micro-computer  we are beginning to emphasize precision and smallness rather than inefficiency and large size. We in Saint Christopher and Nevis earnestly ""aspire to become a micro-State which can serve as a model because of the quality of life enjoyed by its people. We were in the vanguard of international thought in calling in Saint Christopher and Nevis the first conference to discuss ways and means to commemorate the five-hundredth anniversaryof the voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World. The work of that conference is bearing fruit and will result in positive action.Because we feel that this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is of such tremendous significance  the Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis has allocated a site in our historic capital of Basseterre. There we shall establish a Center of higher education and a national library emphasizing the history and function of our great international body. This area we shall proudly dedicate as the United Nations educational complex.I sincerely hope that everyone here will some day walk into that historic complex and recognize its significance as a symbol of our commitment to multilateralism and our appreciation of the imperative of interdependence as an indispensable ingredient for the achievement of world peace."
"70",3870,"KWT",40,1985,"At the outset  I should like to express the sense of shock felt in my country at the earthquake in Mexico  a disaster which has resulted in thousands of casualties among the friendly people of Mexico  as well as total destruction of houses  installations and facilities.While we trust that the people of Mexico  well-known for its courage and patience  will be able to recover from this tragedy  we should like to declare from this rostrum that the people of Kuwait stands by the people of Mexico in its plight and that the Government and people of Kuwait will not hesitate to send every possible assistance in an effort to alleviate the burden of the Mexican people in its present affliction.Mr. President  it is my pleasure to Congratulate you on behalf of Kuwait on your election as President of this significant session of the United Nations. You represent a venerable and friendly nation with whom Kuwait and the Arab world have historic ties  characterized over the ages by friendship  co-operation and understanding. With your renowned wisdom and remarkable abilities  we are confident that success will be yours in the conduct of the affairs of this session.I should like also to pay tribute to the fruitful efforts of your predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  during his presidency of the previous session of the General Assembly.I also want to register our thanks to Mr. Javier Perez de Ouellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  appreciation of his services to world peace and in upholding the role and effectiveness of the United Nations.The Amir of Kuwait  His Highness Sheikh Jaher Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah  would have liked to be here today to address this important body on this historic occasion  had it not been for compelling circumstances. His Highness has asked me to convey to the Assembly his best regards.There is no doubt whatsoever that the period in the history of mankind in which we live is faced with a number of threats that jeopardize the future of man in an unprecedented manner. Our realization of the magnitude and nature of those threats makes the imperative that we pause for a lengthy review of the forces and factors which influence the direction of our collective march forward for generations to come. It makes it imperative that we undertake a sincere discussion of the best methods for preventing any diversion from the course of this march  which is guided by the United Nations Charter.During this century  mankind has been afflicted by two world wars which came close to destroying the wealth of civilizations built by our forefathers in every part of the world. Evil tendencies coupled with overpowering force overshadowed 'truth and the supremacy of law iv. such a way that eyes everywhere were turned with hope towards the international efforts which were being made at that time to reorganize the world in which we live by putting forward an international formula which would  on the one hand  put an end to world wars and guarantee the security  peace and stability of the world and  on the other  lay down the outlines of a new world order in which the rule of law  justice  peace  harmony and prosperity would prevail. As a result of these sincere and enormous efforts  the world Organization came into being  and its birth was a source of hope that the world might be moving towards a brighter reality and a more promising future.We cannot find a better time than this  when the United Nations is celebrating its fortieth anniversary  to pause and reflect on the future of the world Organization  a forum in which this gathering of world leaders is discussing its problems.We should like to begin by saying that in reviewing the 40 years of the existence of the world Organization  we are bound to come across a great number of hopeful signs. Yet  at the same time  we confront a great number of signs which give cause for pessimism. We also find ourselves compelled by intellect and logic to state that our world today is very far removed from perfection or  to say the least  from the situation we hoped would prevail when our forefathers drafted the United Nations Charter 40 years ago.For despite the fact that the darkness of colonialism has already receded and that the dawn of political liberation and economic advancement has emerged  the shining light of independence which has reached the remotest parts of the world has stopped short of reaching some nations  which continue to languish under the yoke of one form of colonialism or another. I speak particularly of the peoples of Palestine  Namibia and South Africa  which are all struggling against tyranny. Furthermore  the vestiges of times gone by are still with us and accentuate the wide gap between the advanced and developing nations.In taking up the task of evaluating the assets of the United Nations and its role in the international community  we must ensure that we do so from the proper perspective - namely  through dealing with failures only against a clear background of successes - and that we evaluate whatever has been achieved of the goals of the United Nations only from that standpoint.Heading the list of those goals which the United Nations was established to achieve is  naturally  the maintenance of international peace and security. In spite of the fact that world peace and security during this period have fallen short of our hopes  as the result of either limited local and regional wars  which frequently break out  or because world problems and dilemmas threatening world peace and security have persistently remained unsolved  it is clear that the world has not witnessed any world wars during this period despite the frequent recurrence of world crises during which limited wars threatened to spill over into other parts of the world or to bring the world increasingly closer to the brink of catastrophe as a result of the escalation of the cold war between East and West.There is no doubt that the periods in which the policy of detente prevailed between the two super-Powers  short as these were  have been the only periods when relative tranquility prevailed and negative expectations about the future of mankind lessened.The United Nations has repeatedly proved its effectiveness during those international crises  either through mediation efforts or through the use of its good offices represented by its Secretary-General  or by sending peace-keeping forces to areas of international tension.One should not ignore the role played by the United Nations in defense of human rights  particularly the fact that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was completed only three years after the establishment of the world Organization. It therefore heads the list of great achievements of the United Nations  even if this does not mean that this Declaration has eliminated continuing violations of human rights in various parts of the world.We should also pay tribute to the role of the United Nations in the field of self-determination and independence - a role that was embodied in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  whose twenty-fifth anniversary is also being celebrated this year. The fact that so many countries have joined the United Nations is by itself an indication of its success in this outstanding area of the Organization's work  as well as a source of hope that the nations that are still languishing under the yoke of imperialism and foreign domination will attain their full rights.The success of those United Nations efforts is complemented by an even greater success in its attempts to achieve the other two principal goals for which the Organization was established  namely  the promotion of friendly relations among all States and the achievement of international co-operation solving economic  social and development problems. Current international efforts  led by the United Nations  aimed at ridding Africa of the problems of famine and drought are one of the landmarks of the Organization's endeavors in this respect. All those positive elements should constitute the appropriate background for any genuine evaluation of the effectiveness of the United Nations - particularly when some tend to criticize a number of negative elements which  up until now  have stood in the way of the effective implementation of the Charter - without giving any consideration to the forces which occasionally try to orient the Organization in a direction contrary to the causes of peace  security and prosperity in the world. It is our conviction that those negative elements fall into two categories:One is endemic  stemming from a fault or deficiency in the functional structure of certain United Nations organs  particularly the Security Council  where the permanent members have the right of veto  which has paralyzed the Council on various occasions when world peace and security hinged on a strong unanimous resolution by the Security Council.The other is extraneous to the framework of the United Nations and stems from the policies of certain States which insist on having their own interests outweigh those of the international community as a whole. This is evidenced by the eagerness on the part of certain major Powers to try to settle international problems through individual efforts that bypass the United Nations. The recurrence of such actions undermine the role and prestige of the United Nations in its efforts to solve international disputes.When we review the list of international problems which continue to prevail because of negative attitudes surrounding the decision-making process and the implementation of United Nations resolutions  the question of Palestine  which has been on the United Nations agenda since its inception  leaps to the forefront.While the Security Council is unable to deal with the developments of this problem  which flare up periodically  thus threatening world peace and security and requiring decisive action on the part of the Council  we find that the General Assembly  on the other hand  has adopted scores of resolutions which guarantee the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination  to return to its home and establish its own State on its national soil.Furthermore  the General Assembly has repeatedly expressed its concern to find a solution to this problem  in the creation of which the United Nations itself took part when it decided to partition Arab Palestine  and when it then accepted the Zionist entity in its membership before any opportunity was given to the Palestinian people to establish its own State.That concern has been reflected by the setting up of a special committee  namely the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and the convening of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine in Geneva in 1983.The obvious discrepancy between the positions of the Security Council and the General Assembly is a consequence of the positions of certain major Powers designed to protect the aggressor  namely  Israel  by sparing it from any international pressure  either by paralyzing the Security Council  or blocking the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. Such positions have increased Israel's arrogance  increased its continued arbitrary policy and its continued occupation of Arab territories  the very thing which has led to the increasing inability of the United Nations to perform its functions in accordance with the Charter.The continued Israeli occupation of cherished Lebanese land reflects yet another chapter in the continued Israeli aggression on Arab territories. Consequently  Israel must expect the Lebanese national resistance to remain the Sword of Damocles until its genuine withdrawal from the land it occupies and until it ceases to interfere in the internal affairs of this Arab sister state.The second problem of concern to the United Nations and which the world Organization should not spare any effort to solve  is the problem of southern Africa  the ugliest facet of which is the continued control by the white minority in South Africa over the destiny of the black majority  with its iron-fisted rule imposed without any regard for the will of the international community.This deplorable picture is also reflected by its continued occupation of Namibia. The United Nations concern in this respect has found expression in the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia whose function is to administer this Territory until it gains independence.This arrogance on the part of the apartheid regime in South Africa is supported by the positions of some Western States  which not only associate with the racist regime  despite its condemnation by the United Nations  which calls upon all nations to impose sanctions  but they actually support it  whether by refusing to impose and implement strong deterrent sanctions against it  or by introducing impossible conditions  the end result of which would be to keep the general situation in South Africa and Namibia exactly where it is today.The insistence on the part of Western States to take such positions encourages the racist regime to persist in its aggressive policy against the black majority  on the one hand  and the neighboring African countries on the other  while hailing the current popular upsurge in South Africa  Kuwait hopes that this will motivate all the States which have relations with the racist regime to reconsider such relations and to give full support to this courageous upsurge.Besides these questions  our world is not devoid of other areas of tension. There is the problem of Afghanistan  whose people continue to languish under the yoke of a regime supported by Soviet troops. There are also the problems of Cambodia and Central America  which are awaiting a solution from the international community  in accordance with the United Nations Charter  which guarantees the freedom  independence and sovereignty of all States of the world and which prohibits interference in the internal affairs of other States  as well as the use or threat of use of force.The common denominator in all these problems  as we see it  is the intervention by major Powers in a way that will not help their solution. It is our conviction that involvement  if based on using the good offices of those major Powers  in an effort to solve those problems  and thus serve the cause of peace  would constitute a constructive effort. However  for that involvement to serve only v.he interests of those same Powers  or of the aggressors  would be something that is unacceptable to the international community.However  although most of the blame for the failure to settle most of the international problems rests squarely with certain major Powers  either because of their interventions outside the framework of the United Nations or their blocking of the Security Council through exploiting the use of the veto  there are some other international problems in which the parties to the dispute or some of them are to be blamed for the lack of a settlement. Heading the list of these problems  is the Iran-Iraq war  a war which broke out over five years ago  and which has brought death  devastation and destruction to thousands of people on both sides  all this despite the repeated appeals and ceaseless mediation efforts  both by the world Organization itself  which has played a great role in this field  and by certain States or organizations which are interested in seeing this destructive war come to an end. However  while we see one of the two parties to the dispute  Iraq  constantly expressing its readiness to put an end to the war  we find that the other party  Iran  fails to respond to the will of the international community  which wants this war to end without delay.If there is one region eager to have this catastrophic war come to an end it is undoubtedly the Arabian Gulf area  which appreciates the gravity of the responsibilities of its States. Those States are represented by the Gulf Co-operation Council  which considers co-operation among its member States a basis for their constant pursuit of peace  harmony  stability and prosperity in this sensitive region of the world. Furthermore  the continuation of this raging war all these years has exposed  and indeed continues to expose  the States of the Gulf area to the danger of a widening of the war's scope so as to engulf other parts of the region. Kuwait itself has repeatedly been exposed to the fallout of war. In recent days  the problem of the interception of some Kuwaiti commercial vessels by Iranian authorities has recurred in a manner that constitutes a flagrant violation of all international norms and conventions and the principle of free navigation in international waters  as provided for in Security Council resolution 552 (1984)  which described such acts as a threat to the security and stability of the area and which reaffirmed the need to respect the rights of all States to free navigation in accordance with international law.For all these reasons  we reaffirm our absolute support for all the efforts aimed at putting an end to this destructive war between two Moslem neighbors  Iran and Iraq  and restoring peace and prosperity to this region.The world situation  fraught as it is with apprehensions.about the implications of the failure to solve the international problems which jeopardize world peace and security is also overshadowed by a dark cloud which makes all those concerned about the security and tranquility of mankind feel extremely concerned. I am speaking of the wave of terrorism which the world has been witnessing for several years.Kuwait has been subjected to a series cf such blind terrorist attacks  attacks which aimed at challenging the rule of law  international norms and ethics. Kuwait  therefore  calls upon the United Nations to make more serious and sincere efforts to define the dimensions of international terrorism and to lay down an effective international co-operative basis for the elimination of this dangerous international phenomenon as soon as possible. Combating international terrorism has become an international collective responsibility which we all have to assume sincerely and honestly.The universality of the United Nations has made of this world Organization a true mirror reflecting the collective will of the international community  and that  in itself  involves tremendous burdens on Member States  both individually and collectively. Consequently we call upon all States  at this time when theUnited Nations is celebrating this important anniversary  to seize this opportunity to renew their commitment to the	principles which govern internationalconduct in accordance with the Charter. The destiny of the world depends upon the commitments of States.In the course of discussing these general principles we should like to refer more particularly to some of the rules to which States should adhere  foremost among those rules derived from the spirit of the Charter are the following. First  is the need for all States  both large and small  to make all possible efforts to reinforce the role and effectiveness of the United Nations  through rendering every possible assistance to any action taken by the United Nations for world peace and the prosperity of mankind. Second  is the need for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. Third  is the need to support the various efforts of the Secretary-General in the use of his good offices  and to strengthen his role in the settlement of international problems. Fourth is the need to refrain as far as possible from settling international problems in isolation from the United Nations. The recently increasing tendency to concentrate on individual efforts in international relations will undoubtedly have a harmful effect on the concept of international co-operation and collective efforts.While reviewing  at this time  the United Nations experience with all its elements of success and failure after 40 years of its existence  the eyes of the world are directed towards us to see whether we have learn from this experience  with all its favorable and unfavorable elements  and whether we have striven to ensure that the world Organization will be an effective instrument which will help us solve our problems through dialog and not confrontation.In assuming our common historic responsibilities within the framework of the United Nations  we sincerely hope that our future will be better than our past  a future where truth is restored  a future where reason and justice  freedom  fairness and equality prevail. Let us work together for a tomorrow where the collective human experience will reach the stage of maturity with whatever that entails in terms of a common sense of the depth and worth of this experience for the present and future of mankind. May God grant us his help and support."
"71",3916,"LAO",40,1985,"At the outset of its statement  the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic expresses to the delegation of Mexico its roost heartfelt condolences at the cruel human and material losses sustained by Mexico from recent earthquakes.On behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic I express my warm congratulations to your Sir  on your unanimous election to the office of President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that  under your wise leadership and thanks to your long experience in diplomacy  the work of this session will achieve satisfactory results.I should like also to express my sincere appreciation to Ambassador Paul Lusaka for the outstanding way in which he guided the work of the preceding session.My warm congratulations and greetings go also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his indefatigable and constructive efforts in the cause of the maintenance and strengthening of peace  security and international co-operation.This year the fortieth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the international community is commemorating several important historical events.Last May progressive mankind solemnly observed the fortieth anniversary of the great victory over the forces of fascism and militarism which  in unleashing the Second World War - resulting in the lost of 50 million lives  something which no one must forget - dreamed of dominating the world and subjugating its peoples.Also  as a decisive factor in the restoration of the independence and sovereignty of many countries of Europe and Asia which saved millions of people from fascist barbarism  that victory has gone down in history as a glorious page recording the triumph of the great ideals of peace and justice. Those same ideals led to the establishment of the United Nations  whose prime task is the maintenance of international peace and security and whose fortieth anniversary we will be celebrating this month.Indeed these two coinciding anniversaries cannot be separated from one another  because the founding fathers of the United Nations  and in particular the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  deeply affected by the tragedy and harsh lessons of the Second World War  stated in the very first words of the Charter the need ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  and to that end invited peoples with different political and social systems ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors"". The latter concept has become a new principle governing international relations  namely  peaceful coexistence.Since the end of the Second World War  more than 100 countries which were at that time under foreign domination have regained their right to self-determination and become independent and full Members of the United Nations and of the Non-aligned Movement.These important events in international political life are in keeping with and respond to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. In recent decades  on the initiative of the socialist countries and the Non-aligned Movement  the United Nations has adopted several important resolutions and helped on several occasions to halt local conflicts and resolve the disputes that constituted a threat to international peace and security. Likewise  the United Nations has helped to slow down the arms race. It has  moreover  established the legal foundations for the movements struggling for peace  national independence democracy and social progress  in particular by adopting the Declaration on theGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960  on theinitiative of the soviet union. That Declaration is the symbol of the elimination of colonialism  and we shall soon be celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary.But unfortunately this Declaration has not yet been fully applied  because colonialism  racism and apartheid continue to afflict some regions of the world. It is therefore imperative that all Members of the United Nations act in concert to eliminate these scourges once and for all.The United Nations  with its 159 Member countries  is representative of the international community  and should be a center where the efforts of nations are harmonized  above all in the area of safeguarding international peace and security. In this spirit that we hope that every Member of the Organization will bring its political will to bear to ensure that the implementation of the Charter will be more effective.However  what concerns us is that at a time when the United Nations is preparing to celebrate its fortieth anniversary and officially proclaim that 1986 will be the International Year of Peace  warlike imperialist circles have been working to aggravate the already tense situation by trying to disrupt the military and strategic balance through a new escalation of the arms race. They are thus trying to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in several West European countries and to manufacture new generations of nuclear weapons  what is more  they have planned  through their ""Star wars"" program  to deploy anti-missile weapons and anti-satellite weapons in outer space.It goes without saying that this new escalation of the arms race further increases the danger of nuclear war and thus constitutes a matter of grave concern to the international community.In recent times the imperialists  in order to defend their so-called vital interests  have been carrying out acts of provocation  issuing threats and interfering in the internal affairs. Its of several States  all acts that amount to a form of State terrorism  and have thus created hotbeds of tension in various regions of the world.In Central America and in the Caribbean we are witnessing an intensification of the undeclared war against Nicaragua  interference in the domestic affairs of the people of El Salvador and the pursuit of a hostile policy towards Cuba.In southern Africa the situation continues to deteriorate because the racist regime of Pretoria  with the support of the imperialists  is intensifying its. repression  massacres and arrests of the black people of South Africa and prolonging its illegal occupation of Namibia  as well as carrying out acts of aggression against its neighboring countries  in particular Angola. These acts constitute a flagrant violation of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of those countries as well as of the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations and of the Non-aligned Movement.In the Middle East the Zionists and imperialists plan of domination and expansion has met with strong opposition from the Arab nationalist forces  which forced the aggressors to withdraw from Lebanon. But the Israeli occupation troops  with the support of certain imperialist countries  have intensified their barbaric repression of the Lebanese civilian population and carried out massacres of Palestinians in refugee camps which constitute a serious violation of human rights and of United Nations resolutions as well as a threat to the peace and security of the region.Faced with the existing tense and complex international situation  the Heads of State and Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania - representing the five continents - appealed last January to the countries possessing nuclear weapons to adopt measures conducive to containing and reversing the nuclear-arms race. For their part  the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries put forward proposals aimed at halting the arms race  both on Earth and in space  in particular through the prohibition of nuclear tests  a nuclear-arms freeze  and the reduction and eventual complete elimination of nuclear arms from our planet. Those countries also put forward the proposal on international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space under conditions of its non-militarization  and proposals to restore detente in Europe and other regions of the world. Moreover  the Soviet Union has unilaterally undertaken not to be the first to resort to nuclear weapons or to deploy anti-satellite weapons in space  and has proclaimed a moratorium on nuclear tests from 6 August 1985 to 1 January 1986. These proposals were broadly supported by the peoples devoted to peace and justice and by international public opinion.For its part  the Lao People's Democratic Republic firmly supports the aforementioned appeal  the constructive and realistic proposals and the unilateral commitments. These prove the sincerity and great sense of responsibility of these countries towards mankind. If all the nuclear Powers were to follow the example of the Soviet Union  the danger of nuclear war would be considerably reduced. For the time being  the international community is expecting much from the United States-Soviet Union negotiations  recently resumed in Geneva  and from the forthcoming summit meeting between these two countries  the success of which will have a very positive effect on international relations.The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its solidarity and unswerving support for the people of revolutionary Nicaragua and the Sandanist Government in their valiant struggle against subversion  the threat of aggression and economic blockade by imperialism and its puppets  in order to safeguard their national  independence and the achievements of their revolution. Our Republic also supports the peace process undertaken by the Contadora Group and appeals to the United States Government to resume the Manzanillo negotiations.We firmly support the just struggle of the people of El Salvador against oppression and exploitation and for freedom and true democratic rights.The Lao People's Democratic Republic would like further to reaffirm its solidarity and unswerving support for its brother Cuban people in their determined struggle against the threat of aggression and subversion by imperialism and demands that the Guantanamo Base be returned to Cuba.It is equally imperative that foreign troops withdraw rapidly and unconditionally from Grenada so that the people of that country may freely exercise their right to self-determination.We strongly condemn the repression  threats and arbitrary arrests of the black population of South Africa and firmly support the courageous struggle of that oppressed people  under the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) against apartheid and for the restoration of their basic human rights in a non-racist democratic society.We reaffirm our unswerving support for the heroic struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole  legitimate representative  for their right to self-determination  freedom and national independence in a unified Namibia. We strongly denounce Pretoria's recent decision to establish the so-called interim government in violation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and to linking the granting of independence to Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist forces from Angola.The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its militant solidarity and unshakable support for the Angolan people in their brave struggle against the acts of aggression and sabotage by the racist Pretoria regime and for the defense of the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country.We firmly support also the courageous struggle of the patriotic forces of Lebanon against the Israeli occupier for the defense  independence  sovereignty and unity of their country. We condemn the barbaric practices of the Zionists and firmly support the just struggle of the Palestinian Arab people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole  legitimate representative  for the restoration and exercise of their basic inalienable rights  including the right to found an independent Palestinian State. In our opinion  the proposal of the Soviet Union on the convening of an international conference for peace in the Middle East - in which all parties concerned  including the PLO  would participate on an' equal footing and with the same rights - is the solution which could lead to a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the region. This proposal  therefore  receives our full support.The conflict between Iran and Iraq in the region of the Persian Gulf has already caused much loss of human life and property on both sides  we would appeal to these two countries to resolve their differences peacefully and honorably.The increasing imperialist military presence and the strengthening of the Diego Garcia base and other logistical stage posts in the Indian Ocean region constitute a threat to the independence and security of the littoral and hinterland States of the region. In view of this tense situation  we deem it essential that the international conference on turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace take place within the time frame established by the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan continues to be the victim of an undeclared war waged from a neighboring country with the support of international imperialist and reactionary circles. We strongly condemn that armed interference and subversive acts against Afghanistan and reaffirm our support and unswerving solidarity with the Government and people of Afghanistan in their struggle to safeguard their national independence and the fruits of the April revolution.The policy aimed at perpetuating the division of Korea and setting up a new military alliance in the Far East has created a permanent situation of tension there. We demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and support the proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea for the peaceful and independent reunification of their Korean homeland without foreign interference.In the same context  we support the proposals of the Soviet Union on the preparation of confidence-building measures in the Far East and its proposals aimed at strengthening peace and stability in Asia. We 'also support the proposals of the People's Republic of Mongolia on the conclusion of an international convention on non-interference and non-recourse to force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific. These proposals  we feel  are in keeping with the interests of the peoples of the region.During the last six years the situation in South-East Asia has taken a positive turn  despite the many difficulties resulting from the destructive war  its aftermath  and the subversive activities of international imperialist and other reactionary circles. The three countries of Indochina  in particular the People's Republic of Kampuchea  have achieved great success in their respective task of defense and national reconstruction.These successes show us that the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Kampuchean people  which are developing their country and strengthening it more every day  are now in control of all of their national territory and have become full masters of their homeland. The fact that the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam jointly declared on 16 August during the Eleventh Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam in Phnom Penh  capital of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  that the partial withdrawal of the Vietnamese volunteer forces from Kampuchea would be continued on an annual basis and totally concluded in 1990 is proof of this development and consolidation. It is also proof of the sincerity of Viet Nam which continues ceaselessly to do everything in its power effectively to aid the Kampuchean people and to respect the independence and sovereignty of Kampuchea.It is time that the international community respected the legitimate rights of the Kampuchean people in its labor of rebirth and national reconstruction on the path it has itself chosen. The seat of Kanpuchea in the United Nations and in other international bodies should be restored to the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the sole legal and genuine representative of the Kampuchean people.On the other hand  despite the obstacles created by hostile circles  the tendency towards dialog in the region has also developed. Indeed  the recent meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam  representing the three countries of Indochina  and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  representing the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  has created conditions for a greater mutual understanding for the purpose of finding a solution to the problem of peace and stability in South-East Asia. To this end  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam have worked ceaselessly to restore friendly relations with neighboring countries  in particular with the People's Republic of China  and to restore good-neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Thailand  and to make the border of Laos and Kampuchea with Thailand one of peace and friendship.During the Eleventh Conference of their Ministers for Foreign Affairs  the three countries of Indochina once again reiterated their proposal to sign a treaty of peaceful coexistence with the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Thailand.Moreover  the People's Republic of Kampuchea has declared its willingness to negotiate with groups or with individuals belonging to the opposition  on the subject of national reconciliation  on the basis of the elimination of the Pol Pot clique and the organization of general elections after the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese volunteer forces from Kampuchea.We hope that these steps forward can lead towards the objectives pursued by all countries of the region - namely  peace  stability  friendship and co-operation.However  it is regrettable that Lao-Thai relations have not yet been normalized and that a number of important problems remain unresolved.On 2 October 1984  the Thai Government announced before the General Assembly the withdrawal of its troops from the three Lao villages. But up to now  although these troops have been withdrawn  they still occupy several neighboring points in the interior of Lao territory and are continuing their criminal activities against the local civilian population.In spite of this  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  ever faithful to its foreign policy of peace  friendship and co-operation  has not ceased to make efforts to safeguard and develop the friendly and good-neighborly relations existing between the two peoples. In this spirit  the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic recently repeated to the Royal Government of Thailand its proposals to negotiate at governmental level  either in Bangkok or in Vientiane  in order to ensure the strict application of the joint Lao-Thai communiques of 1979  which established the necessary bases for harmonious relations between the two countries. But unfortunately the Thai Government has not to this day responded positively to our sincere proposals. In the interests of the two peoples  as well as in the interests of. peace and stability in the region  the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic hopes that the Royal Thai Government will respond reasonably to those proposals.The arms race has resulted in a significant increase in military expenditures during this decade. If one part of these incredible sums were used in the economic and social sphere  we could have eliminated much misery from the world. As we know  military expenditures have plunged the developed capitalist countries into a hopeless economic crisis. To escape from that crisis  they have taken protectionist measures  and are practicing a monetary policy which generates high interest rates and other problems. This state of affairs has of necessity had very negative effects on the economic and social situation in the developing countries  particularly among the least developed: a deficit in their trade balance and a serious increase in their foreign debt which is becoming an unsolvable problem. This situation has led to a deterioration of the living conditions of those peoples and in particular of the mothers and children who are among the most vulnerable.To resolve this crisis  it is important that there should be a restructuring of the system of international economic relations as it exists at present  on a more just and democratic basis  and the establishment of a new international economic order  free from all neo-colonialist pressure and exploitation.At the same time  the capitalist creditor countries should find reasonable  appropriate solutions to the problem of the debt of the developing countries.However  it is regrettable that to date global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development have not yet begun  as a result of certain capitalist developed countries clinging to their selfish interests and thus continuing to obstruct the establishment of a new international order.Furthermore  to assure good health to future generations in general  and to mothers and children in particular  we find that the Secretary-General's appeal for the carrying out of a universal immunization campaign for children between now and 1990 is very timely indeed  and in accordance with the policy of our Government with regard to mothers and children; hence we support this appeal.In commemorating the fortieth anniversary of these two historic events — the great victory over fascism and the creation of the United Nations - we cannot but think of the tragedy of the Second World War and draw a parallel between the present situation and that existing before the war. when we see the imperialists carrying out acts of aggression  threats and blockades against several countries in various regions of the world; when we see them engaging in an ever more unbridled arms race; when we see expansionists advancing territorial claims which are unfounded; and when certain circles claim entire regions of the world as their sphere of vital interests  and organize ""crusades against communism"" - all this cannot but bring to mind the facts which provoked the outbreak of the Second World War.Therefore  we hope that the tragic lessons of this war will serve as a warning to the peoples of the world and encourage them to devote all their efforts  both physical and intellectual  to eliminating the danger of nuclear war and safeguarding international peace and security.The Lao People's Democratic Republic  which was the victim of the imperialist war of aggression for several decades  has no other desire than to live in peace and friendship with all countries on the basis of respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  equality and mutual interests.In this spirit the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Lao people will do everything in their power to contribute to the struggle of the peoples of Asia  Africa  Latin America and the other regions for peace  national independence  democracy and social progress.In conclusion  the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic wishes every success to the General Assembly at its fortieth session."
"72",4006,"LBR",40,1985,"The Government and the people of Liberia extend profound sympathy to the Government and the people of Mexico on the devastating earthquake which caused the loss of thousands of lives and the destruction of property. We pray that God will strengthen and comfort the bereaved families  provide shelter and assistance to the homeless and heal the injured.I bring warm greetings from the Head of State of Liberia  His Excellency Samuel Kanyon Doe  and from the Government and the people of Liberia.It gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  the sincere congratulations of the Liberian delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fortieth session. Your unanimous election  at the time of the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  is a well-deserved tribute to you as a statesman and as an eminent diplomat and scholar who has contributed enormously to a better understanding of the United Nations.It is an equal privilege for me to pay a tribute to your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Paul J.F. Lusaka of Zambia  whose election as President of the Assembly at its thirty-ninth session was a credit to our Organization and an honor to the entire African continent. The success which attended our last session was attributable in no small measure to his able and astute leadership.The energy of the Secretary-General in the service of the united Nations  as well as his constant dedication to the cause of international peace and co-operation  continue to command and merit our respect and admiration. He have listened to his views  comments and suggestions over the past months. We compliment him for his mature and balanced utterances and urge him to continue to discharge his duties with the courage and the conviction of his conscience.It was the assignment of my Minister of Foreign Affairs to up-date at our thirty-ninth session the progress which had been made by my Government in its process of returning our country to civilian rule. Within the next week  Liberians will go to the polls in fulfillment of the solemn promise which the Head of State made to the Liberian people - a premise induced by no external influence - to return the country to civilian democratic rule. That transition is nearing completion with four political parties currently campaigning for the elections which will be held on 15 October 1985.The Liberian people are excited by the prospect of participating in a free election for the first time in almost 100 years  and look forward to the institution of a civilian Government based on the principles of democracy and equal participation of all the Liberian people in peace  unity and progress.Forty years have elapsed since the birth of our United Nations and throughout those years  it has gone through bitter trials and tribulations. This fortieth anniversary"" is therefore a milestone which merits special recognition. That the Organization has come this far is a tribute to the vision of those who drew the founding plans  and a testimonial to the soundness of the guiding principles upon which it was built.Equally important over the past four decades is the realization and recognition by all nations that  although our Organization has not lived up to our expectation  yet it represents the best hope for the survival of our world community.The United Nations has proved to be an incomparable force and an indispensable factor in international relations over the past 40 years. The principles it embodies  the forum it provides for the expression and harmonization of conflicting views and the multiple services it renders humanity testify to its competence and the useful role it plays as a human and political Organization.The United Nations is the ideal Organization to cope with the type of problems that face humanity. Its uniqueness lies in its special role in enabling us to obtain a defined image of the world  its resources and needs  its attitudes and problems  its opportunities and challenges and  at the same time  in helping us to develop new patterns of action while there is still time to do so. Whatever it may be - the atmosphere  or the sea  over-population or food shortages  the united Nations will bring to us a recognition of the problems and an awareness of what needs to be done.In spite of the fact that the United Nations has become a permanent factor in international life  it has its troubles. From its very existence  it has been encumbered by great-Power rivalry and conflicts. Its efforts to promote social progress have often been hampered by discord and strife. It has been called upon to keep the peace where there was no peace in the hearts of men. It has been buffeted by nationalism as the new nations of former colonial Powers have moved to rule themselves in freedom and to assert their rights to speak and act as equals in the forums of nations. It has been confronted with the problems of racism  apartheid and other forms of degradation and suppression which are yet unresolved. It has been beset by financial and constitutional crises threatening to bring its operations to a standstill and ultimately to tear it apart.Thus  the Organization is powerless even when its basic principles are violated  its authority challenged and its very survival threatened. The mounting agenda of unresolved issues is a clear reflection of this impotence.Apartheid has been  and continues to be  a perennial item on the agenda of the Assembly. In the early 1960s following the setting up of the Organization of African unity (QAU)  passive national organizations emerged in South Africa. The peaceful Sharpeville protest  members may recall  was met by military police repression  violence and terror and the intensification of social oppression.The OAU forced the question of apartheid upon the agenda of the international community. What was the response from South Africa? More repression  more violence  more terror. And today  we listen to Mr. Botha's pronouncement that there can be no official change in South Africa until those who over the years have sought violent change  give up violence. Who has been violent?The insincerity of the regime is clear. The demonstration of anger is the outpouring of a people whose patience has reached the limits of its endurance.Is South Africa interested in peace and freedom? No; its interest is solely in the perpetration of apartheid - and to do so it kills indiscriminately  it arrests almost everyone. It invades the territory of adjacent States and constantly proclaims its intention to repeat acts of aggression in utter contempt of the international community.We strongly believe that the United Nations will understand Africa when it says that the struggle against apartheid is an African struggle and not just for the indigenous people of South Africa. It is a struggle for the dignity of the people of Africa  and the freedom of African States to which we committed ourselves when the OAU was created.The foreign policy which certain nations friendly to the Verwoerd  Vorster and Botha regimes have evolved over the past three decades have seemingly been centered on the narrow national interests of those States. How any country could have fashioned a network of co-operation with a Government whose economic  cultural  political and social system is based on man's unkindness and cruelty to man  without a modicum of consideration of morality or ethics  baffles the imagination  and this is an international political affront. In the system of apartheid there has never been any attempt to hide its method of operation  camouflage its designs or blur its wickedness.It is pathetic that a system that sets apart the races of mankind which constitute the family of man  totally ignoring humanity  love  justice  fairness and mercy  should still find acceptance by some States  as it has over the last decades. This is why Africans have always questioned  and will continue to question  the motives and true interest of those countries which give comfort to South Africa. On the one hand they pontificate about human rights and on the other they indulge South Africa in its crimes against the rights of the majority.My Government believes that the world community is not easily taken in by this rush of activities. We will not confuse activity with action. The latest events in South Africa that we now behold  including Mr. Botha's proposed cosmetic changes  are not occurring purely because of recent international developments or international pronouncements.We believe that the forces inducing those changes had their origin more than three decades ago. Today's reality goes back  far back  to the birth of the Organization of African Unity  on 25 May 1963. On that historic day  the last resolution that the Assembly of Heads of State or Government adopted empowered the Foreign Ministers of Liberia  Madagascar  Sierra Leone  and Tunisia to makerepresentation to the Security Council about the foul actions of the South African regime  led by Vorster  against the authentic African inhabitants of the country  as well as the status of Namibia  the Trust Territory of the League of Nations  which had been transferred to the United Nations. During that Security Council debate  we heard  as we should hear so often later  pious utterances about the repugnance of apartheid. When the Council proceeded to vote. South Africa escaped indictment because of the use of the veto by those whose policy today remain virtually unchanged.Following that historic session  Liberia and Ethiopia brought contentious proceedings before the International Court of Justice against South Africa as regards its continued illegal occupation of Namibia. All but one of the Judges of the Court who supported South Africa in its illegal occupation were from the same States as continue to drag their feet 24 years later cm the South African policy of apartheid and the independence of Namibia.Let me solemnly declare from this rostrum that the progress made over the past three decades on the matter of South Africa  apartheid and the independence of Namibia has been the result  on the one hand  of sustained and determined efforts by the OAU  the non-aligned States and a few other friendly Governments and  on the other  of the determined resolve of the leaders of the legitimate indigenous people of those two countries who  by the sacrifice of their lives  ensured that they would not cease their effort or abandon their resolve until they achieved freedom and independence.The question of Namibia has been before this Assembly in one form or another for many years. Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was unanimously adopted in 1978  set out the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia.That document also identified all those involved in that process! the Government of South Africa  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the Western contact group and the front-line States. It is now seven years since the acceptance of that document  but Namibia continues to be subjugated instead of independent  and a bogus interim Government has been created possessing no international standing and commanding no internal support.Except for a warning by the Security Council of future consideration of mandatory sanctions and a mild interest on the part of those countries which might be willing to impose limited unilateral sanctions- South Africa is permitted to remain confident in its defiance of international opinion on Namibian independence. Why must this be so?The linkage between the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the withdrawal of troops from Angola  we should remember  was not put forward by South Africa until 1981  at a time  we should also remember  when all obstacles to implementing resolution 435 (1978) had been overcome by all participants  including South Africa. Why then this linkage? All that the United Nations has sought by its resolution 435 (1978) is the peaceful transfer of power to the indigenous Namibian people. Is this not one of the solemn purposes of the United Nations? How long can we  as members of this international community permit this obstruction?We must remember also that the people of Namibia resorted to armed struggle many years ago only because there was no peaceful alternative. Are we to remain passive and thus force the implementation of that resolution by SWAPO's intensifying its armed struggle?The Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East and its key issue  the Palestinian problem  have remained unresolved despite intensive efforts undertaken by the United Nations during the past 38 years. Each war fought in the regionhas become more destructive because of the employment of new and more sophisticated weapons. The destruction of life and property has not resolved old issues but created new ones and widened the scope of resentment and mistrust among opposing parties.The Government of Liberia believes that a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East will have to meet the following conditions: the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories; respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  free from threats or acts of force; and a just settlement of the Palestinian problem based on recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including the right of self-determination.The support of the major Powers  especially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  is essential for achieving any settlement in the Middle East under some form of United Nations auspices. In this connection  Liberia will continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to find the means by which we can move forward to a negotiated peace in the Middle East.The preservation of Afghanistan's sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and non-aligned character is essential to a peaceful solution of the Afghanistan problem. Foreign troops should be withdrawn from the Territory and all the parties concerned should work together for the urgent achievement of a political solution and the creation of conditions to enable the Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor.The Kampuchean situation has created a climate of instability and insecurity in South-East Asia. The withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and non-interference in the internal affairs of the Kampuchean people constitute an indispensable starting point for peace  stability and co-operation among South-East Asian countries on the basis of Mutual trust  confidence and goodwill.The question of Korea remains a dangerous threat to international peace and security. The unity of the two Koreas must be restored through dialog and negotiations between the two countries without outside interference. The good offices of the Secretary-General should be encouraged to help facilitate the settlement of the Korean question  especially in easing the sufferings of millions of separated families.Admission of the two Koreas to membership of the United Nations could contribute greatly to the reduction of tension on the Korean peninsula and thus the promotion of international peace and security. Both Koreas are members of a number of specialized agencies and should be allowed to share in United Nations responsibilities and obligations through their membership.The Falkland Islands (Malvinas) conflict between the United Kingdom and Argentina has not been resolved in spite of the commitment of both sides to peace and a negotiated settlement. We call on the United Kingdom and Argentina to resume negotiations in order to find a peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute and their remaining differences relating to the question.The Contadora process in Central America seeks to restore peace in the region through commitment to the suspension of the arms race and to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. The Contadora initiative deserves support from the international community as it demonstrates the Latin American will to find solutions to the regional problems.The cessation of the nuclear arras race is now imperative. It should not only be an end in itself but should be followed immediately by a substantial reduction in nuclear forces  leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the final goal of general and complete disarmament. In parallel with this process  it is urgently necessary to transfer the precious resources currently wasted on military expenditure to social and economic development.The nuclear-weapon States have particular responsibility for the dangerous state of the arms race. We urge them to join in the search for a nest direction  and welcome the Geneva agreement reached earlier this year between the Soviet Union and the United States that led to the current negotiations dealing with complex questions concerning space and nuclear arms  both strategic and intermediate range. Liberia attaches great importance to the proclaimed objective of these negotiations  namely  to prevent an arms race in space and to terminate the arms race on earth. We expect the two major nuclear-weapon Powers to implement in good faith their undertaking to produce  at an early date  significant results from their negotiations.My Government reaffirms its belief in the commitment to multilateral economic co-operation  as well as its recognition of the important role that the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other United Nations agencies play in this meaningful process. We appeal to the donor countries to increase substantially their contributions to UNDP above and beyond the agreed 8 per cent of gross national product so that UNDP may continue its development projects.The economic situation in the African region continues to be dismal  owing to drought  desertification  famine and the heavy debt burden. We express profound appreciation to the Secretary-General for sensitizing the international communityto the plight of the affected countries and mobilizing international assistance to complement the national efforts of African Governments.He welcome the recent United States proposal for a joint facility of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ease the debt crisis and improve the economic performance of poor African and other developing countries. The proposal is timely and we trust that practical and positive steps will be taken on the third-world countries debt crisis and the economic recovery of our respective regions.We believe that the convening in early 1986 of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa  as proposed by the 21st Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  is appropriate  important and necessary to address the critical economic situation of the region.The United Nations remains the only global instrument for establishing international order and maintaining peace and security. It has saved us over the past decade from the ""scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"". It has succeeded in many parts of the globe in obtaining equal rights for men and women of nations large and small. It has made significant headway in establishing conditions in which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be ensured and maintained. It has promoted social progress and a better standard of life in larger freedom.None the less  there is need for a new concept of allegiance to the United Nations as the principal authority of the world community. That concept should begin with the application of the Charter principles as an irreplaceable instrument in the struggle for the independence and equality of States and peoples; for the realization of human rights and man's freedom; to rid the world of war  aggression and every form of oppression; to eradicate economic and social backwardness and to liquidate colonialism  racism  apartheid  and other forms of human servitude.There is a basic need to preserve the Organization and turn it into an effective instrument for freedom  £>ace and justice  which can be realized only if its Members are prepared to rededicate themselves to implementing its decisions.We should not forget that we have much in common  a great sharing of interests and much that we can- lose together  for ourselves and for succeeding generations. Let us therefore redouble our efforts to retain the simple human values which are our common heritage and build a firm foundation on which we can unite our strengths and live together in peace and with faith in the United Nations."
"73",4052,"LBY",40,1985,"At the outset I wish to express  on behalf of the delegation of the Jamahiriya and its people our congratulations to you  Mr. President  our dear friend  on behalf of your unanimous election to the presidency of this important historic session. Historical relations of friendship link our two countries and peoples. They are ties of civilization. Your skill and wisdom are indeed unique and we are therefore convinced that the work of this important historic fortieth session will be crowned with success.We should also like to express our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  who conducted the work of the previous session with skill and wisdom.I should also like to express our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the efforts he has made and continues to make under difficult circumstances  in many cases  in order to promote the role and effectiveness of the United Nations.We are celebrating at this time the fortieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. We must assess the performance of 40 years of this Organization  an Organization which was  is  and will continue to be a reflection of the hopes of peoples in peace  stability  freedom  and justice.Its achievements are manifold  particularly in its assistance to the peoples of developing and poor nations  through its numerous institutions  which have done most efficient work. We can indeed say that in this area the United Nations has played a positive role.However  the other side of the coin is that the United Nations has also failed despite its importance and despite the efforts of many Member States to promote its role. The fault does not lie with the United Nations itself. However  it has failed to find a solution to many world economic and political problems.As we celebrate this fortieth anniversary there are fundamental issues before the United Nations which remain unsolved. The Palestinian people continue to languish under the yoke of the Israeli occupation  despite hundreds of United Nations resolutions. The racist regime in South Africa continues to practice the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid  despite numerous United Nations resolutions. Other regions continue to suffer from direct colonialism in many parts of the world.If the people of the world through long struggles have managed to gain their freedom  as demonstrated by the fact that although there were only 50 Members of the United Nations at its inception  we find today that there are now over 150 Members. The African continent in particular has witnessed a bitter struggle for freedom. Dozens of States in our continent have achieved freedom and independence.Despite these achievements  we believe that the United Nations has today become incapacitated because of the lust for power of some major States  and because of the spirit of hegemony and domination  as well as neo-colonialism  on the part of some States  which are opposed to that movement towards freedom in the world. He see that this lust for power has incapacitated and handicapped the United Nations. He see those major Powers making threats and practicing policies of aggression in many parts of our world including Central America  the Middle East  Africa and Europe. We also note that those major imperialist Powers  which are obstructing the work of the United Nations  have set up racist regimes which practice the role of the Trojan horse in the Middle East  on the African continent and in other parts of the world.We are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of our international Organization. The City of New York is being visited by the largest number of Heads of State and Government in its history  who have cone to stress their solidarity with the United Nations and its effective role. However  we have witnessed another commemoration of a different kind  different from the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. We witnessed the celebration by the Zionist entity of this fortieth anniversary by its direct aggression against our sister Tunisia  a Member State of this Organization  the celebration of another incident in the continuing aggression against the Palestinian people in the form of the pursuit of that people even in far away places to which some members of that nation have emigrated. This act of aggression  which is merely another link in the long chain of acts of aggression  underlines anew the nature of the Zionist entity. It highlights the error committed by the United Nations against the rights of the Palestinian people when it admitted that Zionist entity as a Member of our Organization.We in the Arab world and the African continent are aware of this; we have continually warned of the danger of this entity  of this cancer to the Arab peoples  to the African continent and  indeed  to international peace and security.International Zionism  as a racist movement  succeeded in the Second World War  and indeed in the First World war  to mobilize the largest force present at that time in the world in its favor. Thereafter  that entity was born  that Zionist entity  that racist entity.Following the Second World War  the Zionist entity also managed to mobilize in its favor and in favor of its aggressive policies  the largest Power on the face of the earth. The tragedy of the Palestinian people is a unique tragedy. A whole people has been forced to leave its homeland. Its place has been taken by a group of invaders  foreigners and terrorists. Most unfortunately  the world  following an unacceptable and distorted logic  lends legitimacy to those mercenary terrorists and denies the legitimate rights of the original people of Palestine. The distorted logic of ""might is right"" gives legitimacy to the aggressor instead of those suffering the aggression. This logic justifies aggression; it justifies terrorism and crime.Why? Are the Arabs not part of the human race? In my opinion  for those who support the Zionist entity the Arab is not a human being. The Zionist entity is expanding; it is occupying; it is annexing the occupied lands of the Arabs: the Golan Heights  Jerusalem and the settlements. It is given billions of dollars by the United States of America that enable it to create new settlements and buy weapons of destruction for the commission of new crimes and for further expansion.When we see that a super-Power  a permanent member of the Security Council  speaking through its President  justifies the attack against Tunisia  that murderous act of international terrorism  we wonder what destiny awaits this Organization.When we see that terrorists in Nicaragua are called freedom fighters  while Palestinians fighting for their freedom are labeled as terrorists  we wonder what distorted logic is being invoked  and we begin to get some idea  some inkling  of the future of this Organization.Those people speak of peace. What peace? Peace through occupation? Peace through the annihilation of the Palestinian people? Is it peace through aggression  peace through creating settlements and annexing territories? Those who wish to free their country are labeled as terrorists  and so are those who assist them. At the same time the Zionist racists - because they are superior to otherhumans  the people chosen by God  as if God sells land - are supported and their acts of aggression are justified.In the light of history  and of the present course of events  we must conclude that the logic of force is the only logic prevailing. No peace can be achieved in our Arab region except through justice  through allowing the Palestinian people to exercise their right of self-determination in their own land  to return to its own land  and forcing the Zionist aggressors to withdraw from the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories. This cannot be achieved except by fighting neo-Nazism. What Hitler did is nothing compared to the crimes perpetrated by Shamir and Begin.We here in the United Nations permit Shamir  who killed Bernadotte  Shamir who is considered a terrorist and banned from many countries  including the United Kingdom  we allow him to come here and speak on behalf of the so-called people of Israel.We are not inimical to Jews. Jews are our brothers; we are of the same race. But we are against Zionism as a movement  a racist movement. No peace can be achieved in the Middle East and the Arab region as long as the Zionist ideology strives to impose itself on our Arab nation and threaten it.The Palestinian people cannot be deprived of its rights forever. Just as Rhodesia disappeared  just as Rhodesia became Zimbabwe  Israel will disappear and Palestine will take its place. South Africa will also disappear and will become Azania.As we witness the direct acts of aggression of the Zionist entity  the continued acts of aggression directed against our Arab nation  as we witness the mass killings of Palestinians  we also witness another type of aggression  supported by the same imperialist circles  acts of aggression directed by the racist regime of South Africa  which is organically linked to the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine  acts of aggression directed against the brother country of Angola. At the same time as aggression against Tunisia and the Arab nation is being justified  there is a refusal to condemn that attack against Angola. The two racist regimes are identical in nature  and in both cases the United Nations is unable to take any action  because one super-Power uses the right of veto to frustrate all international efforts and resolutions.As we are about to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the time has come to review the United Nations Charter. That Charter was adopted at a time when the world was dominated by colonialism. The time has come for the United Nations to represent the peoples of the world. That Charter  which was laid down for a handful of peoples in the world  has become an instrument used against the freedom of peoples  against their struggle and against their independence.As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  we call for peace. However  peace seems to be very far away. The major Powers are rapidly increasing their arsenals. They are arming their racist allies. We in the Arab region face a serious threat because of the nuclear capability of the Zionist entity and because the assistance rendered by the United States and some other Western states enables that entity to obtain nuclear weapons. The Zionist entity has refused to sign the international conventions  yet the imperialist Powers nevertheless continue to provide that entity with nuclear technology. when any other country in the region tries to obtain nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  protestations are heard everywhere and threats are made. However  when the Zionist entity obtains nuclear weapons and nuclear technology  through smuggling in the first place  and through the appropriation by force of radioactive materials  there is dead silence. It seems that the Zionist entity is above criticism  that and above the united Nations; it is justified in all its acts of killing  in its nuclear weapons  and its destruction - all these are made to seem logical and acceptable  and can be justified.The secret services of the Zionist entity are thanked for pinpointing where innocent civilians are to be killed in Tunisia. Co-operation between the racist regime in occupied Palestine and the racist regime in Pretoria is a source of concern to the United Nations and to the Arab world  which has expressed that concern. What has the United Nations done? It has done absolutely nothing  because it is handicapped  because one of the two super-Powers mobilizes all its capabilities to defend that entity.We have adopted hundreds of resolutions on the rights of peoples: the rights of the Palestinian people  the rights of the people of South Africa. How many of these resolutions have been implemented? How many will be implemented? None have been implemented. Small nations are beginning to lose their faith in this Organization  including my people. This is because the United Nations has become an instrument used by the major Powers to further their own interests. The mere presence of the United Nations in the United States constitutes a total handicap. The Organization is threatened. Every day we hear threats against it: ""if you decide to leave  we shall be at the dock to wave you good-bye"". That is what we heard last year. Let us be the ones to say good-bye. Let us take this Organization to another place  to a country which respects this Organization  which respects its resolutions  the Charter and the objectives of this Organization and respects human rights. We must look at this question more seriously. We must look to the future of the United Nations. When we are threatened with reduced contributions  when we are threatened by various other measures  and when strangulating conditions are imposed on diplomats  we must review the location of our Organization.Other regions of the world are in a state of tension because of the policies of imperialism and colonialism. Other outstanding problems in the world remain unresolved. The people of Nicaragua continue to face direct aggression. Efforts are still being made to overthrow its legitimate Government. Why this attack against Nicaragua? Because the people of Nicaragua have got rid of Somoza  because it has achieved its independence  because it has the courage to face up to imperialism. The peoples of the world are supposed to kneel and say yes. Those who say no are terrorists  to be killed or dispersed  just as the Palestinian people have been dispersed  just as people of South Africa are being dispersed.There are other regions of the world which are still under threat. Only a year ago a small nation of only IOC 000 people was invaded - the people of Grenada  which was subjugated by force of arms. Which of us can defend himself? Who knows what will happen to us  the small peoples of the world  if a super-Power practices international terrorism and invasion?The region of the Mediterranean has also become an area of constant tension and is under direct threat from the major imperialist Power. The fleets are on our borders  in our territory waters. States are facing economic siege. Direct acts of aggression against them represent a desperate attempt to undermine our revolutionary Governments  because we got rid of the United States bases  because we nationalized American companies  because we decided that we would be free. In the minds of the imperialists freedom is not something to be respected. However  this will not deter us. We have lost more than half of our people in a long struggle against Italian fascism. We have sacrificed hundreds of thousands to defend our freedom. We are a non-aligned State; we decide our own policies  and we wish to be the friend of all nations  but we refuse to be the satellite of any State  however strong  we reject all conditions  and we will continue to do so.The attempts to commit aggression against nations friendly to us is well know. The reason for the most recent campaign against us has become very clear; we know why it was undertaken. It was an attempt to change the polarity of the friendly people of Tunisia so that the aggressive forces of Israel could strike at the Palestinian and Tunisian peoples. The super-Powers mobilized their fleets and their forces  claiming provocation. What is the position new? He are allies of Tunisia and its people; we stand by the people of Tunisia in facing up to this aggression and we shall continue to do so. There is an organic link between us and the people of Tunisia; we are brothers in one Arab family and our common enemy is Israel and those that support Israel.Other regions of the world are also experiencing tension and war. The war in the Arab Gulf is continuing  despite all the appeals to put an end to it. It is continuing because the American imperialists want war in that region; they have a vested interest in war. We have said since tile beginning that the killers and the killed in this war are both victims. The brother Moslem peoples of Iran and Iraq must take a common position against the Zionist entity. The Revolutionary Government in Iran has declared from the outset its solidarity with the Arab Moslem nations concerning the liberation of Palestine. We were happy to see that revolution  because it was an anti-imperialist revolution that overthrew a puppet regime that was mobilizing all the potential of the country in the interest of the Zionist entity.He believe that: the time has come to put an end to that war. Let us put an end now to the striking at civilian targets and commercial shipping in the Gulf. Let us put an end now to the use of chemical weapons. Let us put an end now to attacks against innocent civilians. He believe that if this were done we would achieve the result we all desire  which is finally to end that war.Other peoples continue to be threatened with division and aggression. The American forces in Korea continue to prevent the unification of the Korean peninsula. And there are other outstanding problems. The problem of Western Sahara remains unsolved. The problem of Afghanistan remains unsolved. We look forward to a solution of those problems through respect for the will of those peoples and their right to self-determination.We support the United Nations resolution calling for a plebiscite in Western Sahara. The solution of the problem of Western Sahara would constitute a major step in unifying the Arab Maghreb. We and our brothers in Morocco have united in an African-Arab alliance. We belies this is only one step towards the unification of the Greater Arab Maghreb. This unification of our peoples must take place in freedom  without attempts at acquire hegemony or to impose policies on others in the region.The problem of Chad is still outstanding  despite the many resolutions of the Organization of African Unity on this subject.The world economic situation is most significant. The unjust financial and monetary system established without the participation of most of the countries of the world has led today to an economic crisis that threatens our peoples. This situation is due to the enormous debt of the developing countries  which has now reached more than $900 billion. It is owed to imperialist circles andimperialist banks  which have drained developing countries of their wealth through their monopolies and multinational corporations. The time has come to solve this problem in accordance with the interests of the developing countries.The gap between the rich and the poor and the fact that the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer  constitute a threat to international peace and security. The world will achieve no peace of any kind as long as this situation continues.We see  together with this international economic situation  an escalation of the arms race  on which billions of dollars are spent. We see star wars and the militarization of space. Would it not be better to spend some of that money to save she starving millions in Africa? would it not be better to save the 800 m.-iXion people of the world who are threatened with hunger? we hope that the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States will lead to the lessening of tension and the reduction of the level of armaments. However  as small peoples  we must not merely be observers; we must not accept any solution of these problems at our expense. We as small peoples have a right to live. We cannot allow one or two States to shape the destiny of the world. We support peace; we support *:he reduction of armaments. However  at the same time  we believe that the United Nations must be a partner in the achievement of peace and that without the United Nations no such activities can be undertaken. We believe that the Non-Aligned Movement  which represents the aspirations of many peoples of the world must play an important role in this field.We in the Mediterranean region began a series of meetings as a group of non-aligned countries last year in Malta and the results were very positive. Our aim is to make the Mediterranean a act of peace and stability  without foreign fleets or foreign bases and free of spheres of influence.Towards the end of this year we shall meet again to continue our deliberations on peace and stability in the Mediterranean region. He hope  with the co-operation of other States which belong to military alliances  to maintain peace and security. The Jamahiriya will put forward proposals to put an end to maneuver in the territorial waters of States bordering the Mediterranean Sea.The international economic crisis and the international political situation that we are witnessing today requires that we be aware of the danger of the situation. We must all work together with the necessary political will to achieve peace  but peace can only be achieved through justice.It is incumbent upon us now to look objectively at our previous resolutions and to implement them. If we want to maintain international peace and security  if we really want to ensure the survival of this Organization  we must bring justice to the oppressed peoples. The Palestinian people must be represented here  the aggressor must put an end to its acts of aggression  the people of Azania must be represented here among us and Zionist and racist regimes in the world must be overcome. The presence of those regimes brings shame upon us. They are a threat to international peace and security. We must put an end to the arrogance of power that we witness today. We must stand together as small peoples to confront colonialism.Those peoples threatened with American aggression must unite; they must confront that aggression collectively. The peoples which today are languishing under the yoke of colonialism and whose economic and political independence is being threatened must unite. The peoples of the third world must undertake a South-South dialog  free from hegemony and domination  we must put an end to the present economic order. We must put an end to multinational corporations. We must begin to nationalize those multinationals so that we can achieve international peace and security.The presence of nuclear weapons is a threat to our peace and security. We must create nuclear-weapon-free zones  in the Indian Ocean  the Mediterranean and other regions  we roust dismantle foreign military bases in all parts of the world. The presence of such bases is a threat to us. The presence of American missiles in the Comoros is a threat to our peoples. The presence of American missiles in Europe is a threat to Europe and the Mediterranean. The security of the Mediterranean and of Europe is closely linked and indivisible.The right of peoples in South America to self-determination and to choose their own policies must be recognized and supported. The time has come to put an end to hotbeds of tension. We must put an end to colonial domination and hegemony. We must make a just peace  not peace in the interest of major Powers and colonial domination.My country includes itself among the small nations. We stand shoulder to shoulder to achieve the objectives of the United Nations as set out in its Charter. We work to achieve human rights and must stress that the rights of white people are no more important than those of black people; the rights of Jews are no more important than those of Moslems or Christians. We are all part of heaven-sent religions. We must all reject Zionism."
"74",4157,"LKA",40,1985,"At the outset  let me congratulate Ambassador de Piniés on his well-deserved election as President of this historic fortieth session of the united Nations General Assembly. His long and varied association with the United Nations and its system  as well as his reputation as one of Spain's most experienced diplomats  is well known. Sri Lanka has excellent relations with Spain and  on behalf of my delegation  I assure him of our fullest support and co-operation in the tasks ahead.Our appreciation is due in large measure to Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  who during the thirty-ninth session demonstrated rare diplomatic skills and capabilities in preparing the way for this fortieth session.On behalf of the people and the Government of Sri Lanka  let me express our profound grief at the heavy toll in human and material terms claimed by the earthquakes which tragically struck Mexico last week. Our hearts reach out to the Government and the people of Mexico at this hour in their heroic endeavors towards rescue  recovery and rehabilitation.The session on which we have embarked is important  not only because it marks 40 years in the life of the United Nations  but also because the current international situation holds prospects for a decisive breakthrough in questions which had seemed intractable in the past. It is our view that no situation is completely bereft of hope; no issue is so bleak to be incapable of solution. We can render this fortieth session more than symbolic if we seize the potential for peace and build on those areas where results appear possible. History  as Arnold Toynbee often saw it  is a succession of challenges and responses  and it is the solemn duty of the international community to respond to these challenges to enable the construction and maintenance of a fair and just society.The promise of economic co-operation on a global scale has been turned down by those who have the economic muscle. Unilateralism and myopic economic competition seem to be the order of the day. The negotiating tables for the restructuring of international economic relations stand bare and unattended. The microphones of dialog have been abruptly stilled. The prospects of an international economic order based on equity  justice and co-operation seem to be far off.As we gather at the united Nations for this annual collective survey of the world situation  tumultuous events are unfolding in South Africa. That country's turmoil has rarely been so intense and widespread as it has been in the last few months. The repressive acts of the white minority regime have been extended to affect even little children. But the resistance and determination of the people of Africa to be free has not been shaken by the severity of the measures that have been imposed   Day by day international opinion is being awakened into a realization of the moral and physical atrocities of apartheid. More and more countries are moving to take measures and sanctions to express in practical terms their repugnance of the present regime and the system it maintains. The non-aligned States and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) have maintained a consistent opposition to apartheid. This growing international trend will continue to gather momentum until eventually the entire structure of apartheid is brought down. The dismantling of apartheid would be expedited if those possessing the powers of persuasion and pressure over the South African regime intervened without any further delay and halted the further hemorrhage of the African nation. Action under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter could bring an end to apartheid and the injustice and human suffering it causes in South Africa.The same forces which animate and sustain the South African regime hold Namibia in captivity. Namibia is clearly a colonial issue. It is twisted and needlessly complicated and linked to extraneous issues. Independence for Namibia has nothing to do with East-West rivalry. It has nothing to do with the dispute between conflicting ideologies nor with the question of Cuban troops in Angola. Resolution 435 (1978) remains the charter for Namibia's independence. This is a comprehensive blueprint for Namibian independence. It has been accepted by all parties concerned  including the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). To prolong the agony of Namibia is to court more bloodshed and suffering and to devalue the credibility and standing of this very Organization.Similarly the essential prerequisites for a settlement of the cluster of issues in the Middle East are not difficult to identify. The States of the region cannot expect to live in peace and security until the central factor of regional instability  the core of the Middle East problem  the question of Palestine  is faced squarely and solved justly. The inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people must be restored  including the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland in safety  their right to self-determination and their right to establish an independent sovereign State without external interference or coercion. Sri Lanka expresses support for the Arab Peace Plan adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held in Fez in 1982. This Peace Plan has been reaffirmed at the Extraordinary Summit Meeting held in Casablanca in August this year. Sri Lanka has consistently taken the position that Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories. Israel must dismantle the illegal settlements it has set up in the occupied territories. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must be a party to any negotiation that would lead to a settlement of the Middle East question.The agony of Lebanon is not an isolated phenomenon  but a pact of the Middle East question. Sri Lanka declares its solidarity with the Government and people of Lebanon  we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon and reaffirm our full support for the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon.Sri Lanka is gravely concerned over the tragic continuation of the conflict between Iran and Iraq  two fellow non-aligned States with whom we enjoy excellent relations. It is our fervent hope that bilateral and multilateral efforts at a settlement of this wasteful war will bear fruit and that a solution acceptable to both parties will be found soon.In South-East Asia the presence of foreign troops in Kampuchea has hampered the development of mutual confidence and good relations among the States of the region. Sri Lanka supports all efforts aimed at a comprehensive political solution which would lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea. This step is vital to the restoration of normalcy and the creation of a climate of confidence and understanding in South-East Asia.Tension looms large in South-west Asia because of the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. We have carefully watched the constructive efforts made by the Secretary-General to find a political solution. We hope that an early solution will be found that will enable the Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor. Sri Lanka has always expressed its support for a political settlement that would include the withdrawal of foreign troops and guarantee full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and ensure scrupulous observance by all States of the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in its internal affairs.Sri Lanka supports the desire of the Korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully  through direct dialog  without foreign inference and in conformity with the principles of the North-south statement of 4 July 1972. In the meantime  it may be prudent to examine whether the process of reunification would be expedited if the principle of the universality of membership of the United Nations were extended to the Korean people.In Cyprus a communal issue has been tragically exploited to justify the invasion of the Republic by foreign forces and this has led to the de facto partition of that country. External intervention cannot be justified nor can it be condoned on any grounds  even cm the grounds of concern for kindred communities in other states. Sri Lanka have consistently called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cyprus  and pledged respect for the country's unity  independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned personality. The unilateral declaration of independence in 1983 by representatives of one of the two communities was illegal and should be rejected by the international community. Those unilateral measures have only rendered an eventual settlement in Cyprus more complicated and difficult. Sri Lanka calls on all parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his latest initiative so that a just and lasting settlement can be achieved in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.In Central America  too  independent States face external intervention and destabilization attempts which threaten their very survival as sovereign States. Sri Lanka fully supports the noble endeavors of the Contadora Group to restore peace and stability  as well as mutual confidence  among the States in the region  irrespective of their social or political systems.Every year we deliberate and make pronouncements on the urgent need to achieve our common security through a well-charted process of disarmament. We are agreed that there is no alternative to disarmament. We earnestly hope that the forthcoming talks between the leaders of the two major Powers fill provide an impetus to building confidence between them and contribute to the over-all goals of disarmament and to the security of all nations.The need to facilitate the complementarity of bilateral and multilateral efforts towards disarmament need not be over-emphasized. We have acknowledged that in this nuclear age security through disarmament cannot be the preserve of a few. It is our view that it is the concern of the many.The report of the Conference on Disarmament to this session contains preliminary formulations of provisions o£ a future convention on chemical weapons signifying the fruits of multilateral efforts at Geneva. We are also happy to note that the Conference on Disarmament has for the first time set up an Ad Hoc Committee to commence work on the question of the prevention of an arms race in outer space  an initiative in which Sri Lanka took an active part both in this Assembly and at the Conference. We are encouraged by the agreements embodied in the Final Document of the Third Review Conference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty  which concluded last week. We hope for their early implementation  and in particular for a positive response to the call on the three depositary States and the other nuclear Powers to commence early negotiations for a comprehensive test ban.We should therefore rededicate ourselves to multilateralism in disarmament negotiations. We support the non-aligned initiative for the convening at an appropriate time of the third special session on disarmament as the challenging means of reaching a consensus on concrete and practical measures on disarmament and of revitalizing the multilateral process.In our own region of the Indian Ocean  Sri Lanka  with other non-aligned countries  has striven for a vital measure of disarmament - the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of Peace. The Indian Ocean States have already  in 1979  accepted seven principles of agreement for the implementation of the Declaration. The United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean has worked towards the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean to take place in Colombo  Sri Lanka  next year. It is our hope that all preparatory work for the Conference can be completed to enable the convening of the Conference with the participation of all permanent members of the Security Council  the major maritime users and the regional States.We convened the First Conference on Co-operation in Marine Affairs in Colombo in July of this year. That Conference was born of the conviction that regional co-operation was the best means of realizing the potential of the rich resources of the Indian Ocean for the development of the region. It is expected that a policy-level conference will take place in Colombo next year further to develop the achievements of the meetings held this year.The General Assembly will this year continue its consideration of the Antarctic Treaty System. Sri Lanka's own position on that exercise has been conveyed to the Secretary-General. We strongly favor the establishment of an ad hoc committee at the United Nations to help clarify the issues involved without dismantling the present Treaty System.Permit me in conclusion to volunteer a few remarks on developments in Sri Lanka  about which so much has been written. Sri Lanka is an integrated multi-communal  multi-linguistic and multi-religious nation with a unitary Constitution. Certain strains have developed between one ethnic minority and other communities. As a practicing democracy  the Government of Sri Lanka is totally dedicated to a negotiated political settlement. But a small group of terrorists have launched a gruesome campaign of death and destruction and have rejected the democratic process.That group carries out its operations through the concealed land-mine  the sudden bomb and the hidden assassin's gun. With the assistance and co-operation of friendly countries  the President of Sri Lanka  His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene  is continuing his efforts to achieve a political settlement. It is our earnest hope that these initiatives will lead to the resolution of the problem.Terrorism is not confined to Sri Lanka alone. International terrorism presents a challenge to all civilized life and values. International terrorism has established an unholy alliance with the illicit international trade in narcotics and with other criminal activities. This year the General Assembly will have before it for consideration and action the report of the Secretary-General on measures to prevent international terrorism. Sri Lanka's own views have been conveyed to the Secretary-General  including our views on the need for increased regional co-operation in dealing with this menace. Only a concerted international effort could control  let alone eliminate  international terrorism. Unless the international community takes urgent practical action  the very values that this Organization holds dear will be in grave peril.During the 40 years of the United Nations existence  the world has witnessed 140-odd conflicts  with an estimated human toll of 20 million lives. It is nevertheless a tribute to our political leaders that a major global confrontation has been avoided. Scientific and technological developments have advanced far beyond what was considered possible 40 years ago. Man has delved into the depths of the ocean and stretched human horizons to the far reaches of outer space. Man has walked on the moon. Distance and space have been conquered. The concept of the global village is practically a reality. But if science and communications have shrunk distances and provided the physical means of bringing people to one another at speeds unthinkable four decades ago  it is a sad commentary on our times that nations and peoples must nevertheless feel so apart from each other in political and economic terms. Nations and peoples seem to get further from one another  even as science has brought them closer in physical terms.The United Nations is no world government: we are all independent States. But the United Nations remains mankind's best hope as we seek to bridge the distance in understanding between the nations and peoples of the world."
"75",4269,"LUX",40,1985,"Luxembourg has assumed the presidency of the Council of the European Community during the second half of this year. It is thus on behalf of the Community and its 10 member States that I have the privilege to speak today. This will be the last statement in the general debate to be made by a president of the Council of Ministers on behalf of the Ten  Spain and Portugal having now signed and ratified the treaties that will in a few months make them full members of our great European family.I should like to take this opportunity  Sir  to convey to you our heartiest congratulations on your election as President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your considerable experience of international life and your long and remarkable career assure that our work in this anniversary year will be guided with skill  impartiality and authority.I also wish warmly to thank the President of the thirty-ninth session for his having very effectively guided our discussions during the past 12 months.Finally  I should like to express my gratitude the Secretary-General  who has spared no effort in his tireless work in the cause of peace. Reaffirming our full confidence in him  I should like to urge him to continue in his numerous initiatives of mediation and conciliation.Before dealing with the political and economic problems facing our Organization at this time  I should like to express to our Mexican colleagues our feelings of profound compassion in connection with the terrible catastrophe that has just created innumerable victims and caused widespread damage in the United Mexican States. Emergency assistance was immediately decided by the European Community and the Ten will do their utmost to bring relief to the Mexican people.The United Nations and the European Community were created at an interval of a few years. They came into existence following a conflict that shook the entire world and  particularly  Europe. The lofty ambitions of our Organization - to establish and maintain a climate of peace by reducing and overcoming divisions and tensions  some of them century-old - inspired the European Community.Ten different nations  often bearing the heavy burden of a legacy marked by antagonisms and bloody conflicts  finally succeeded not only in living in peace  but in building a future together. This path of lasting and fruitful reconciliation was possible primarily because of our confidence in the principles of the United Nations Charter and thanks to a concept of the value and dignity of the human person.On the strength of their experience  the Ten are convinced that universal and effective respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms as contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in other international instruments constitutes the best guarantee for justice and peace. They are convinced that civil and political rights  as well as economic  social and cultural rights  are indivisible and intertwined and form an integral part of a global system of protection for the human person. These ambitions and aspirations  which are the main driving force of our Community of Ten  soon to be twelve  make us ready to listen to all those who suffer and to show our willingness to help seek solutions wherever human rights are threatened. The Ten are determined to promote the economic and social development of peoples and to protect and promote human rights everywhere in the world.In the light of these aspirations the picture of the world situation I shall be drawing is hardly encouraging.Recent developments in East-West relations  and particularly the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to resume and pursue negotiations in Geneva with a view to preparing agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space and ending the arms race on earth  limiting and reducing nuclear weapons and strengthening strategic stability  are a source of satisfaction for the Ten. They welcome the resumption of a dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union  This renewed dialog gives ground for hopes of a more positive phase in East-West relations.The Ten will continue to support these negotiations. They are aware that these will demand realism  flexibility and patience. Full respect for commitments entered into will certainly contribute to such a development.The Ten hope that the new Soviet leaders will give concrete expression to a real desire to establish constructive relations between East and West.The Ten regret the persistence of obstacles to genuine detente. The occupation of Afghanistan constitutes a particularly flagrant example of such obstacles. I shall return to this later.They note with regret that human rights and fundamental freedoms continue to be the subject of grave and repeated violations in many Eastern European States despite the principles of the United Nations and the commitments solemnly undertaken in the Helsinki Final Act which were confirmed in Madrid. They remain preoccupied by the situation in Poland because of the resumption of political repression and particularly the increase in the number of detainees.They deplore on the other hand the difficulties created elsewhere for minorities by attempts at forced political assimilation and the denial  purely and simply  of their existence.They are  however  prepared to pursue their efforts to bring about a climate of mutual confidence and understanding between East and West. They hope to see an improvement in relations with the Warsaw Pact countries in so far as the policies pursued by those countries permits.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe presents an appropriate forum to tackle matters of common interest with these countries  as well as with all other participating countries. Two months ago  all the States participating in that Conference commemorated in Helsinki the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of the Conference. That was for us an opportunity to assess the results obtained so far and to look to the future to consider a number of still unresolved issues. The Ten emphasized the importance they attached to respect of all the principles of the Final Act and to the faithful implementation of its provisions. The recent meeting of human rights experts in Ottawa highlighted the gap that continues to exist between commitments freely entered into by participating States and concrete results at the individual level.They hope that two meetings scheduled to take place soon - the Budapest Forum on cultural exchanges and the Bern meeting on contacts between individuals and the reuniting of families - will make possible progress in the implementation of the commitments made at Helsinki and Madrid.At the Stockholm Conference  an integral part of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the Ten will continue their efforts to achieve concrete security - and confidence-building measures  in keeping with the mandate. The Ten appeal again for the dialog begun within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be strengthened and followed up by concrete and tangible results benefiting the peoples of all the participating countries.The situation in Cyprus remains an important source of international concern. The Ten again expressed their support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus  in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions. They remind the Assembly that they rejected the statement of 15 November 1983 aimed at the establishment of a separate State in Cyprus. They reaffirm their statement of 10 June last reflecting their refusal to recognize the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"" and all so-called constitutional developments in that part of the island. The Ten attach particular importance to the good-offices mission entrusted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and call on all interested parties to support his efforts to bring about a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem  and to avoid any action that could undermine the dialog.The Ten stress the importance of dialog and co-operation because we believe that without them misunderstandings are created  tension is increased and the international political climate deteriorates. Indeed  it is that very conviction that is at the basis of the United Nations.Some degree of openness and transparency is indispensable to the achievement of verifiable agreements on the limitation and reduction of armaments. The Ten believe that if greater attention were paid to that essential point a major condition would be met for the achievement of progress in the framework of various bilateral and multilateral discussions on disarmament  now under way.Of course  there are still difficult problems to be solved before effective agreements on the limitation and reduction of armaments can be achieved. The Ten stress that negotiations are needed for the achievement of concrete results  in the form of substantial  balanced and verifiable agreements and that these agreements must be implemented  in the opinion of the Ten  such agreements are and will continue to be a major  indeed indispensable  instrument for international peace and security.Africa is confronting the world with a fundamental challenge: the right to exist and to exist in dignity are at stake there. In several parts of Africa  crises and tensions have led to violence and infringements of human dignity. To that must be added the extreme poverty created by food shortages  and particularly the famine in several regions of the continent. Quite obviously  such serious problems cannot be solved merely by economic measures; political solutions are also required.In South Africa  the vast majority of South Africans are still denied the right to a dignified existence and to the exercise of the roost elementary human rights. The continued tragic adherence of a part of the white population to the immoral system of apartheid causes a continued deterioration of the situation  which each day leads to more violence and injustice and takes an increasing toll of victims. The Pretoria Government must without delay engage in a policy that will lead rapidly to the abolition of the system of apartheid.The Ten would remind the Assembly that their objective is the elimination of apartheid  pure and simple  and not just the elimination of some of its elements. They condemn the use of violence from whatever quarter. They reject the policy of bantustanization. It is inoperative that all the citizens of South Africa enjoy equal rights; the minorities must be protected. The most recent expressions of intention by the Pretoria Government must now take form in concrete measures. Such measures must  above all  be convincing to the black population. The Ten regard as indispensable a greater determination to bring about reform and stronger indications of a desire for conciliation. The opening of a dialog with the representatives of the black population is necessary. In order to improve the dances for such dialog  measures should be taken to establish a climate of confidence; among such measures are those formulated by the Ten - that is  inter alia  the end of the state of emergency  the release of detainees and political prisoners  including Mr. Mandela  and the elimination of discriminatory legislation.This sunnier  and particularly on 22 and 31 July  the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Ten  as well as Spain and Portugal  spelled out their position within the present context. They decided to send a European ministerial mission to South Africa. That mission was in South Africa between 30 August and 1 September. In addition to contacts with the governmental authorities  other contacts took place  especially with representatives of the official and unofficial opposition. On that basis  the Ten decided on 10 September to keep up their pressure  and they harmonized their positions on a number of measures to be taken with regard to South Africa. The question of unofficial measures  including sanctions  remains on the agenda. The Ten reserve their tight to reconsider their position if there is not significant progress within a reasonable period.The Government of South Africa cannot avoid the imperative need to abolish apartheid without delay. Some white inhabitants quite wrongly believe that they can refuse to face the facts. But they cannot escape them. Their responsibility is enormous  and nothing authorizes them to allow their country and its people to be engulfed in chaos.The Ten are rightly concerned over the persistence of conflict situations and of serious threats to the sovereignty and development of the other States of southern Africa. In Namibia  it remains necessary to implement  without pre-conditions and without delay  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - still the only acceptable basis for a final settlement. South Africa's illegal occupation mast cease  and the Namibian people must be allowed to exercise their eight to self-determination as soon as possible. The Ten regard the interim Government established by South Africa as null and void. They reaffirm their support for the front-line States and the Namibian people in the political and economic spheres.The Ten express their full support for Security Council resolution 571 (1985)  which demands that South Africa immediately withdraw from Angola and abstain from all acts of aggression against the neighboring countries.Finally  the situation in the Horn of Africa is characterized by persistent tensions  for which negotiated political solutions must be urgently sought  on the basis of the principles of the United Nations Charter and decisions by the Organization of African Unity.Drought and desertification  particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian region and in the Horn of Africa  have caused death  epidemic  exodus  destruction of traditional structures and delay in the development of all too many States. The assistance to be rendered by the Community  particularly in the framework of the Lome IIIConvention  and its member States to Africans will remain em important priority. I shall revert to this problem in the part of this statement dealing with economic matters. Over and above a rescue policy  the prevention and warning systems must be strengthened urgently  in order to confront food crises more effectively and to alleviate the phenomenal of refugees  affecting 5 million persons in Africa.The Organization of African Unity is aware of the urgency of this approach  and the Ten support the efforts of that organization and its members to bring peace and prosperity to Africans despite the difficulties faced by the States of the continent  difficulties often caused or accentuated by natural disasters.In the Middle East  a region seriously affected by mistrust and violence  there is still no peace or security. The sacrifices imposed there for so long now have led to despair  bitterness and hatred. An extraordinary effort is required to accept the enemy as a neighbor. None the less  the enemies of today must cease regarding each other as such.Within the context of the Israel-Arab conflict  there is a ray of hope. Without haste or hesitation  the hearts and a sense of reason can bring about peace. The Ten consider that the peace efforts embarked upon  particularly with the agreement between Jordan and Palestine concluded on 11 February last  which contains a commitment to start negotiations in keeping with United Nations resolutions including those of the Security Council  are a positive development. The Ten believe that any movement in favor of a peaceful settlement of the conflict should be encouraged. It is necessary to encourage the movement which has begun and to facilitate a dialog between all the parties to the conflict.While a lasting solution should attract the participation of all the parties concerned  a real willingness to expand and support the movement toward peace should be expected from the region as a whole.If the proposed peace initiatives do not find fertile ground  the problems in the area will only worsen. The parties directly concerned must recognize this fact and recognize each other. Denial of the opponent's existence is an act of blindness and is an admission of a lack of strong desire for peace. Recognition by the parties of their mutual existence and rights is a matter of priority.The Ten wish to make a contribution to an overall settlement. We believe that an overall settlement should be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  including the right to existence and to security of all the States in the area  including Israel  and justice for all the peoples in the area and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people  with all its implications.Association of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) with the negotiation process is necessary. The principle of the non-use of force and the non-acquisition of territory by the use of force must be respected  and the territorial occupation by Israel since 1967 must come to an end. The Ten would remind the Assembly that measures taken by Israel in the territories that it has occupied since 1967  which are aimed at altering the legal  geographical and demographic structure of the territory  are contrary to international law.The commitment of the United Nations has often taken the form of a useful contribution to the problems of the Middle East. The united Nations must be encouraged to persist in its work. This is true of the search for peace in the Israel-Arab conflict.and in Lebanon  and in the Gulf crisis.Confrontations in Lebanon have still not come to an end. Acts of violence and terrorism from which the civilian population of Lebanon and innocent foreign nationals  including citizens of the Community have suffered have recently increased in number. The Ten are very seriously concerned by this state of affairs and we would call on all the parties concerned to endeavor to begin a dialog between the various Lebanese communities.In this context  they welcomed the efforts by President Gemayel to promote a policy of national reconciliation in the interest of safeguarding the unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon  with the assistance of all the parties concerned. The Ten reiterate the need for the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  as well as of all the armed elements that are not there at the request of the Lebanese Government. The Ten urge that the observers be allowed to fully play their role  and we remind the Assembly of the importance that we ascribe to the full implementation of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We would call on all the parties to co-operate fully with these United Nations contingents.The conflict between Iran and Iraq has now gone into its fifth year. The escalation of military actions against the populations and civilian targets  and the serious consequences of this for regional stability  as well as for the economy of both countries  have become intolerable.The Ten would make a further appeal to Iran and Iraq for an immediate cease-fire and to enter without delay into negotiations in order to seek  in keeping with united Nations decisions  an honourable and acceptable settlement for both parties. He would support any mediation  including the efforts of the Secretary-General  and we would invite both countries to respect the commitment entered into in June 1984 to avoid the bombing of civilian targets. The Ten would draw the attention of both parties to the serious concern aroused on a humanitarian level  in particular by the treatment of prisoners of war. We condemn the use of chemical weapons anywhere and at any time  and we stress the need to respect the Geneva conventions and other rules of international law  including those regarding the security of civil aviation and shipping.In Asia  the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan has now gone on for nearly six years. The Soviet Union seems to be insensitive to the constant appeals of the international community to withdraw its troops  and it continues its offensive policies in this traditionally neutral and non-aligned country  flouting thereby the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.The Ten would repeat once again their appeal to the Soviet Onion to put an end to its military presence in that country  in keeping with the principles of non-interference and to promote the self-determination of the Afghan people as set forth in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. The intensification of fighting by the Soviet forces and persistent violations of human rights have merely increased the sufferings of the Afghan people.Sorely tested by the growing influx of Afghan refugees  Pakistan has been the victim of numerous attacks from Afghanistan against its territory. The Ten condemn these violations of the Pakistani borders  which will not contribute to a political settlement. Such actions and the shifting of confrontations along the border zone of Pakistan seriously run the risk of extending the conflict.Considering the gravity of the situation  the Ten would remind the Assembly that a negotiated political solution is necessary to resolve the Afghan conflict in a just and lasting manner. He therefore support the good offices of the Representative of the united Nations Secretary-General  from which we expect speedy and real progress. In particular we hope for an agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops  which remains a key element in the solution.On the Indochinese peninsula  Cambodia is still the target of attacks by Viet Nam  which continues to threaten peace and stability in South-East Asia. The persistent violations of its territorial integrity  of its national identity  are part of a policy of fait accompli  an intolerable principle. Repeated violations of the sovereignty of Thailand have also been strongly condemned by the international community. The unprecedented dimensions of humanitarian problems in that region today require  more than ever before  a peaceful  speedy  lasting and comprehensive settlement.The Ten support any initiative aimed at beginning constructive negotiations among the parties concerned  on the basis of the principles agreed to by the international conference on Cambodia. In this connection we deplore the fact that Viet Nam continues to be intransigent and refuses to abide by the various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly by vast majorities.Aside from these two focal points of crisis  the stability of the Asian continent is continually being threatened by the division of the Korean peninsula. In this connection  the Ten observed with satisfaction a few faint signs  which have emerged recently  regarding the resumed contacts between North and South  and in particular the exchange of family visits. A widespread inter-Korean dialog can alone eventually lead to a peaceful reunification of Korea  which the whole population desires in order to be represented in the united Nations.From this rostrum a year ago the Ten expressed the hope that the process of democratization which had already begun in Latin America would continue and spread. Today  with a few exceptions  such as Chile  Paraguay and Suriname  the nations of South America have democratic  pluralistic regimes. The Ten are very satisfied at this development. We are aware of the difficult tasks new facing these countries in consolidating their democratic institutions and dealing with the serious economic and social problems that confront them. The Ten stress their willingness to assist those countries as much as they can in their efforts to bring about economic stability and social justice in the interest of maintaining peace and democracy in that region.The Ten are pleased that a broad range of trends of opinion in Chile have converged in national agreement on the transition to democracy. We appeal again to the Chilean authorities to respect human rights and to cease to impede the re-establishment of democracy in keeping with the aspirations of the Chilean people.The Ten remain convinced that the conflicts in Central America cannot be resolved by the use of force but only through a peaceful negotiated settlement originating in the region itself and based on the principles of independence  non-interference and the inviolability of borders. The initiative of the Contadora Group  which the Ten have supported from the outset  offers the best path towards such a settlement. We welcome the support now being given to the Contadora Group by four democratic countries of South America. We would the countries concerned to agree speedily  on the basis of the Contadora proposals  on a comprehensive  lasting settlement. To ensure mutual trust  the implementation of such a peace agreement must be accompanied by suitable verification and control measures.The Ten believe that it is important for all the countries concerned to contribute actively to a reduction of tension in the area in order to facilitate the Contadora process. Similarly  we call on the countries of Central America to commit themselves to developing democratic systems and guaranteeing full respect for human rights in keeping with the Contadora document which they have signed.The San Jose conference on 28 and 29 September 1984 brought to the capital of Costa Rica the Ten  Spain  Portugal and the Commission of the European Communities  as well as the countries of Central America and of the Contadora Group. Since that conference the Ten have continued their efforts to strengthen their relations with the countries of the region. We hope that the signing of the agreement on co-operation and the institutionalization of the political dialog between the countries of the European Community and those of Central America which is to take place at the ministerial meeting on 11 and 12 November in Luxembourg  will contribute to the economic and social development of those countries and to a peaceful settlement arising from the region itself.During this anniversary year there will be further opportunities for us to reflect on the achievements of the past and  above all  the future objectives of our organization four decades after its creation. Of course  the United Nations system has not been able to fulfill all the immense initial hopes of its founders. But  in a world where hatred  contempt and intolerance continue to rage  the Charter  which should be our creed  remains a point of reference  a standard of measurement for all our actions. After so many years during which our membership has constantly increased  we must  of course  be flexible about how to ensure that the Organization works properly.There is one particular area in which the Ten have always considered it very important that the United Nations play an active role: the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We wish to reaffirm once more that it is the duty of the United Nations to ensure full respect for the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to react promptly and appropriately to violations of human rights wherever they may occur. In this connection  the Ten sincerely hope that a post of high commissioner for human rights will be established so that the actions of the incumbent can reinforce our Organization's procedures.The work of the United Nations can be carried out properly only if the fundamental principle of universality as set out in Article 4 of the Charter is fully respected wherever in the United Nations system the question arises. Respect for the rights of all  in keeping with the provisions of the Charter  should be the guarantee that universality  which is the only principle can enable the Charter to serve the universal conscience.World economic conditions are better today than they have been for many years  although the prospects for growth remain uncertain. Economic recovery  while still inadequate  can be seen seen in several industrialized countries which have succeeded in improving the prospects of growth  thanks in particular to their efforts at structural adjustment and improvement of their economies. Inflation has been substantially reduced  and investments have increased in many countries.World trade has increased appreciably  although the results of the struggle against protectionism have thus far been inadequate and uneven. The recovery has begun to spread from the developed world to the developing world. The adjustment programs of the developing countries are beginning to bear fruit and so far it has been possible to solve the most pressing difficulties of the indebted developing countries. The most urgent problems arising from the famine in Africa are beginning to be solved.Nevertheless  many problems remain. In Europe particularly unemployment continues to be high and is a subject of major concern. The recovery is still inadequate in many developed countries. The international financial and monetary situation remains uncertain. Protectionist tension persists. Many developing countries are still in the grip of grave internal and external problems. Finally  the specter of famine continues to stalk many countries of sub-Saharan Africa.Therefore  despite the undeniable progress made so far  new joint efforts at the national and international levels are needed. The domestic policies adopted so far to improve the performance of our economies must be continued  but it will not be possible to restore healthy  lasting growth and ensure a return to the development process unless each of us remains aware of both the domestic and the external effects of our policies. Special stress was laid on this point at the recent economic summit in Bonn.If the woe Id economy is to function more harmoniously international economic co-operation must be increased. North-South relations play a major role in this connection  and we believe that they must be improved.For its part  the European Community remains committed to an approach to North-South problems that takes account of the interdependence of our economies and the interrelationship between the various problems under discussion in our several forums. It also recognizes the need for of a more concrete  specific approach and believes that we should explore every possibility of dialog and international co-operation in the regions or sectors with the most urgent problems. The dialog it is continuing in the framework of the Lome Convention is a concrete example of that approach.The Community also stresses the need to strengthen multilateral financial development institutions  which play an irreplaceable role. Finally  it considers that the conditions of the North-South dialog can be improved  and it endorses what has been said on the subject  in particular within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Among the most urgent and serious problems facing us  I would mention first of all the problem of hunger in Africa. This is a scourge which imperils the very survival of tens of millions of human beings and calls for the mobilization of the efforts of the whole international community.A certain number of international initiatives have already been taken. Among them I would particularly stress the United Nations Conference on the Emergency Situation in Africa  which met last March in Geneva  following upon the Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa adopted by the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. That Conference  the convening of which was particularly welcomed to us  has undoubtedly made it possible to make the world more aware of the plight of the victims of drought and famine and helped to facilitate the mobilization of resources to aid those people. Within this context stress was placed quite rightly on the essential role of the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa in regard to the co-ordination of bilateral and multilateral assistance.The European Community and its member* states have for their part very rapidly taken a series of measures to deal with the problem of hunger in Africa. Thus  by providing food aid totaling approximately 2.3 million tons of cereals or the equivalent in 1984-1985  they have fully honored their commitments. It might be thought that  thanks to these various measures and the commitments undertaken by various countries  the essential food requirements of the 20 African countries hardest hit by famine would be covered in the next few months  provided we can overcome the vast problems of delivering the international aid to the people concerned. However  no matter how necessary it may be to meet the urgent needs  food aid  in our opinion  involves certain dangers and cannot constitute a lasting solution.In addition to the emergency assistance  effective policies for long-term development must be put into effect. This point has been stressed by our Heads of State or Government  who only recently recalled the need to establish a global co-ordinated strategy against drought  to support the efforts of the African countries in regard to food security and to give priority to the struggle against desertification.The European Community  in this context  is pleased with the decision to establish a special fund for Africa within the framework of the World Bank. It hopes that these operations will make it possible to undertake the necessary structural reforms for reviving the economies of the recipient countries. Furthermore  we very much hope that the current replenishment of the resources of the International Fund for Agricultural Development will continue.The problem of the indebtedness of many developing countries also continues to be a matter of serious concern to us. The burden of debt-servicing often has attained overwhelming proportions and jeopardizes the prospects for development as well as the political and social stability of the countries concerned. This situation continues to pose a serious threat to the whole international monetary and financial system.Significant progress has  however  been made in this field  and a start has been made in solving the most urgent problems  thanks to an improvement in the world economic situation and to the remarkable and courageous effects of adjustment undertaken by the debtor countries and the flexibility and rapidity of the interventions of the International Monetary Fund  the world Bank  the creditors' clubs and the banking system. Nevertheless  the underlying problems remain  and we must all make the necessary efforts to avoid a serious financial crisis.The European Community believes that differential treatment of differing situations of indebtedness within the existing institutional framework is as useful as ever. However  we also feel it is necessary  in the search for lasting solutions  to consider the problem of indebtedness from a standpoint that goes beyond the short term and to examine the matter in all its aspects: the lowering of world interest rates  an adequate transfer of resources  the consolidation of the world economic recovery and sustained growth in international trade are all factors which could serve to ease the constraints on the debtor developing countries. It is equally essential for these countries to pursue policies that would make possible the long-term structural adjustment of their economies.I have already several times stressed the importance that the European Community attaches to the growth of international trade as a contribution to world economic recovery and the giving of new momentum to the process of development. A multilateral system of open trade is essential for general prosperity. Therefore it is the business of all of us. It is important for all of us to continue the implementation of the work program of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to honor the international commitments undertaken in the struggle against protectionism. The European Community supports the launching as soon as possible of a new series of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT which would deal with a balanced array of subjects and allow the interests of all the countries concerned  developed or developing  to be met.However trade negotiations alone will not solve all the problems. We feel that solutions to the problem of imbalance deriving from monetary and financial fields cannot be found in trade negotiations  determined and concerted action is necessary to improve the functioning of the international monetary system. We also need an .Increase in the flow of resources to the developing countries. Results in the monetary and financial fields should be sought hand in hand with results in the trade field. In this regard we note with satisfaction the positive approach demonstrated by the participants in the Bonn summit meeting  both with regard to improvement of the functioning of the international monetary system and with regard to the necessity for an adequate .transfer of resources especially for the benefit of the poorest countries. We hope that the forthcoming discussions within the International Monetary Fund in particular will make it possible to embark on fruitful dialog.I turn now to more specific problems of the least developed countries. In the next few days there will be held in Geneva a mid-term review of the implementation of the New Substantial program of Action for the least developed countries adopted at the Paris Conference in September 1981. we hope that this important meeting will undertake an objective stock-taking of the implementation of that new program of action and will come to agreement on measures to improve implementation.The European Community and its member States have made definite efforts with regard to the implementation of the New Substantial program of Action. I would recall in particular what I have already said on the struggle against hunger afflicting some of the African least developed countries. With regard to official development assistance  I note that some of us have greatly exceeded the target of 0.15 per cent for the benefit of the least developed countries as contained in the New Substantial program of Action. Other member States have come very close to that. I would also recall that of the 36 least developed countries 27 are developing countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific which last December signed the Third Lome Convention. This new Convention  which testifies to the will to strengthen and broaden the links between the European Community and 66 developing countries  will make it possible for a large number of the poorest of the developing countries to benefit from provisions which  while keeping intact the previous Conventions  contain a certain number of innovations. In this regard I should like to stress that the new Convention establishes a new process based on genuine co-operation between the donor country and the recipient country. Constant dialog will make it possible to improve the effectiveness of community aid. Furthermore  I would recall that the new Convention provides for an increased volume of financial resources for the development of the African  Caribbean and Pacific States.In conclusion  I wish to say a few words about the transformation of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UKZDO) into a specialized agency of the united Nations. This is an important event in the history of international economic co-operation  we expect a great deal from this new organization. We are sure that the new UNIDG will benefit from the experience of other specialized agencies and will produce a program and working methods which will enable it to carry out successfully its mission of technical assistance in the field of industrial co-operation  particularly for the benefit of the poorest countries. As I have already had occasion to state  the economic horizon is clearing  but there remains an immense amount to be done before we can ensure the healthy  lasting growth of our economies and to continue and give a new momentum to the process of development. This task is the responsibility of us all and we shall succeed in it only by dialog and co-operation. The European Community  which is shortly to be enriched by the addition of two new members  Spain and Portugal  will shoulder its share of that responsibility. He appeal to all our partners in the North and the South to join in these efforts.The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  which we are celebrating this yeas  is not the end of a journey. This anniversary should  rather  serve as a point of departure. Together we must look towards the future and redouble our efforts to translate into reality the principles of the Charter and the sentiments expressed from this rostrum. Only in this way and by perseverance can we enable the United Nations to assure all mankind of a better future."
"76",4342,"MAR",40,1985,"The United Nations is celebrating this year its fortieth anniversary  strengthened by experience which has no precedent in international relations  although this is accompanied by some apprehension in the face of the need to adapt to a world in which changes are accelerating at an unprecedented rate. Under these circumstances  my country is pleased to see you  Sir  presiding over the destiny of our Assembly  since it is convinced that your great experience and your human qualities will prove an asset in ensuring the success of our work during this crucial session. Our satisfaction is all the greater in that you represent a country with wLich the Kingdom of Morocco has for centuries maintained relations in all spheres of political  economic  social and cultural life which have created deep affinities between our two peoples and afforded a model of fruitful and enriching dialog between two civilizations.We take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  who demonstrated a great sense of responsibility and readiness to be available at all times in the discharge of his duties.We wish  moreover  to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the untiring efforts he is making  with selflessness  courage and tenacity  to prevent tensions and conflicts in all parts of the world and to promote a peaceful outcome of the many crises that trouble international relations.We are profoundly shocked by the tragedy which has struck the great and friendly people of Mexico and deeply distressed and grieved by the sufferings now endured by so many families. From this rostrum  I offer my most sincere condolences to the Mexican people and assure it of our full solidarity and our will to work within the international community to bring it the necessary assistance and aid.Our Organization has been subjected to frequent and often exaggerated criticism of its effectiveness and its ability to face up to the increasingly complex problems of the modern world. Yet it has never been so close to its goal of universality  for it now comprises 3.59 States  whereas only some 50 of us were present at San Francisco when the Charter was adopted. This can be seen as the clearest proof of our Organization's significant contribution to the liberation of peoples from the yoke of colonialism and foreign occupation. The equal representation of all Members within our Assembly  regardless of size and power  and the constant protection of human rights without distinction as to color  race  religion or political opinion have made the United Nations a symbol of the democratization of international relations. It is a unique and privileged forum for meetings and dialog among all States  which can discuss bilateral relations as well as major issues of general interest and thus seek to create a climate conducive to progress and peace.Despite these important achievements  our Organization has naturally experienced certain difficulties in adapting to the great upheavals which have taken place over the past 40 years - be it the access to national sovereignty of peoples representing almost two thirds of mankind and suffering from the consequences of colonialism and exploitation or the technological revolution and the perfection of nuclear weapons in the hands of a limited number of Powers. To place its credibility and its viability on a sounder footing  our Organization must meet the challenges of the modern world by rationalizing its procedures and equipping itself with appropriate mechanisms. We cannot but admit that to date it has proved ineffective in providing an adequate solution to the questions of international security and disarmament  establishing a just and equitable new international order and  finally  the situations prevailing in the Middle East and in southern Africa.At the time when we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of our-Organization we must all be mindful of the founding fathers' firm will to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Throughout these past 40 years our Organization has made praiseworthy and often innovative efforts  such as the establishment of emergency forces  to attain its primary objective  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security. The planet has indeed been spared a global conflagration  which  in the age of weapons of mass destruction  would assume the proportions of true mass suicide  but the fact remains that local conflicts have abounded  especially in the underprivileged regions of the world  thus counteracting the efforts and sacrifices made by the peoples concerned for their economic development.Ideological considerations and the difficulties inherent in the decision-making machinery have very often prevented the Organization from performing with the desired efficiency its functions in the settlement of such conflicts  which are maintained and exacerbated by outside intervention  the recruitment and financing of mercenaries and the granting of transit facilities to them. The Kingdom of Morocco  in line with the recommendation of the non-aligned summit in New Delhi in March 1933  supports all efforts made within the United Nations towards the adoption of an international convention to prohibit such activities. It has also become a matter of urgency to develop the preventive function exercised by the Security Council and the Secretary-General  as an impartial third party  in defusing conflict situations in time by making use of all available procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes  such as inquiry  mediation  good offices or the sending of observer missions.As a State bordering on the most important channel of maritime communications  the Strait of Gibraltar  which links the Atlantic to the Mediterranean  the Kingdom of Morocco has worked constantly within both the General Assembly and the Disarmament Commission in Geneva for the establishment of conditions conducive to peace and security in the Mediterranean. By virtue of our situation at the junction of Europe and Africa  we have maintained a constant interest in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in which the Mediterranean and its southern shores are one of the essential factors.The search for collective security based on co-operation risks being no more than a pious wish unless the international community succeeds in putting an end to the unbridled arms race and the accumulation by the major Powers of increasingly improved and sophisticated means of mass destruction.The first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament raised many hopes through the Final Document and the important measures set out therein. It must nevertheless be admitted  after seven years of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  that the progress achieved is far from being significant and that the Conference has become bogged down in procedural debates or sterile polemics. But the size of the stakes  involving the fate of mankind as a whole  makes it incumbent on us to persevere unremittingly in our efforts. As a member of the Geneva Conference  the Kingdom of Morocco will work  as it has in the past  inter alia  within the Group of 21  to promote concrete and constructive proposals designed to limit and freeze the ruinous arms race. More than $800 billion has been spent this year on armaments  at a time when the greatest part of the world's population is struggling with the endemic evil of underdevelopment. If we are to resolve this contradiction we must make an effort to ensure the success of the forthcoming International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  in particular by inviting all the countries direcULy concerned to participate actively in the preparatory work.The problem of development in today's world  the need ton transformation of the structures of the world economy and the demand for a new international economic order are problems which certainly exceed in complexity the original concerns of those who drafted the Charter of the United Nations.The current disarray in the international economy  which is characterized by a decline in world production  increased unemployment  the deterioration of the terms of trade  the resurgence of protectionism  monetary instability and the chronic imbalance of payments  the explosive level of foreign indebtedness  the reverse transfer of resources and the decrease in real terms in international co-operation mean that the economic crisis has never given rise to so many disturbances in the world since the Second World War. This crisis is not uniform in its effects. Whereas the countries of the South are suffering from an enormous technological handicap and witnessing the reappearance of the scourges of famine and epidemics that were thought to have vanished  the countries of the North  thanks to their technical  financial and human resources  are not only withstanding the crisis  but are even experiencing a certain upswing in economic activity. At the same time  the prospects for the International Development Strategy adopted by our Assembly after a great deal of effort are largely compromised.Faced with a situation that is likely to get worse  we have reached the conclusion that international assistance  necessary though it may be  can be neither equivalent to nor a replacement for the establishment of more just andequitable economic rules. This fact alone should encourage the developed world  setting aside all national egoism  to recognize the need for a radical change in the institutional framework of international economic relations.Where obligations are concerned  however  Morocco asserts with all the strength at its command that our development is the primordial responsibility of our Governments  while remaining at the same time this Organization's priority objective and the main focus of international co-operation.In this context we sincerely hope that the fortieth session of this Assembly will see substantial progress in the finalization of the codes of conduct on the transfer of technology and on transnational corporations  in the implementation of the Integrated Program for Commodities and in the launching of global negotiations. For the time being  however  three problems of crucial importance demand our attention. These are the external debt and the reform of the international monetary system  the critical economic situation in Africa and South-South co-operation in its regional and bilateral aspects.Indebtedness world-wide lies at the very heart of the great changes that are taking place and the external debt of the developing countries  by virtue of its new structure and the enormous cost of servicing it  now exceeds the ability of national economies to repay  is beyond the control of Government authorities and threatens the political and social stability of the debtor countries while at the same time endangering the international banking system and undermining the foundations of economic and social development policy.Consequently we believe that the external debt has to a great extent ceased to be a banking and accounting phenomenon and become a problem that is essentially political and social and that the adjustment policies applied by many countries often lead to a vicious circle of impoverishment and instability.The Kingdom of Morocco considers in this respect that the convening of an international conference on the African debt  the provisions of the Cartagena Consensus of June 1984 and the resolution on external debt recently adopted by the Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries in Luanda are complementary initiatives in that they afford an excellent basis for finding a frame of reference with a view to seeking a just and lasting solution to the problem of external indebtedness based on mutual agreement and the shared responsibility of debtors and creditors and on the essential link that exists between the external debt  development finance and the expansion of international trade.Moreover  since the world has changed  a redefinition of the international monetary system and of the role of the International Monetary Fund are vitally and urgently needed. It is our firm hope that the fortieth session of the General Assembly will promote the convening in the near future of an international conference on money and finance  with world-wide participation  as proposed by the seventh non-aligned Summit  held in New Delhi in March 1983. The results of that Conference should form an integral part of the process of global negotiations  which themselves have been rightly described as a ""major political objective"" of the international community as a whole.where the situation in Africa is concerned Morocco  as an African country  considers it essential that a special session of the United Nations General Assembly be convened to discuss the critical economic situation in Africa.Our Assembly did indeed adopt by consensus at its thirty-ninth session an important declaration recognizing that  despite its considerable economic potential  Africa remains not only the weakest in infrastructure and the least industrialized  but also the least developed continent on the planet. Africa has  indeed  two thirds of the developing land-locked countries and three quarters of the least developed countries  while four fifths of the countries in this region are currently suffering from drought and desertification.For this reason the Kingdom of Morocco is convinced that the international community cannot incur the guilt of failing to assist this endangered continent  and declares that it is a basic duty to demonstrate solidarity towards the African countries in their struggle for survival  development and dignity.The South-South co-operation and its tremendous prospects are an illustration of the third world's commitment to assume its own destiny. We are convinced that  at a time when the outlines of a new structure in the world economy are being drawn  the establishment of a new international economic order cannot be brought about without significant progress in co-operation among developing countries. This co-operation  while aiming at collective autonomy  is in no way inspired by an authentic turning inward  and hence constitutes neither a prerequisite for nor an alternative to North-South dialog.The co-operation my country is engaging in with the countries of Africa at the bilateral and regional level is an outstanding manifestation of this spirit. It has taken on different forms: financial contributions to the plan of action of the Non-Aligned Movement to deal with the critical economic situation in Africa  grants to the Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  loans for the financing of infrastructural work  donations of equipment and transport facilities  participation in mining projects  staff training  technical assistance  provision of medical and veterinary supplies  food aid consignments  fertilizer shipments and debt moratoriums.While we are calling on the developed countries to show firm political will in their solidarity and interdependence with the developing world  my country considers that by strengthening South-South co-operation the Group of 77 will signal to the international community our determination and common will to assume responsibility for our own destiny in the face of the challenges of the twenty-first century.In spite of all the Arab and international efforts and initiatives  the Palestinian people continue to undergo exile and foreign occupation  with all the suffering and privations entailed by that tragic situation. Israeli practices of collective oppression and the denial of fundamental rights of the Palestinian people are continuing  in total disregard of all the resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council.Moreover  Israel has made State terrorism a preferred instrument of its policy of aggression  a fact attested to by the criminal attack just made on the fraternal people of Tunisia and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters  in violation of basic principles of international law.The responsibility of our Organization in the matter is primordial  since it was this Organization which decided at the outset on the creation of two States in Palestine. Nearly 40 years later  we note  however  that the Palestinian people is still denied its right to self-determination and to existence as an independent State  without the achievement of which it is not possible to arrive at a peaceful and lasting solution to the Middle Bast question as a whole.The Arab world  meeting at the 1982 Fez Summit  showed a realistic and rational spirit and a sense of compromise by proposing a peace plan that has been well received by the international community as a whole. In the face of that conciliatory move for peace  what was Israel's response hut the multiplication of acts of repression and expulsion and the establishment of new settler colonies.In view of the escalation of violence. His Majesty King Hassan II as incumbent President of the Arab Summit  insisted on convening an extraordinary session of that body  in order to deal with the dangerous evolution of the situation. The Casablanca Summit was thus able to reconfirm on that occasion its support of the Fez Peace Plan  the implementation of which would entail Israel's prior withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem.Within this framework  the Arab countries called upon the United Nations to assume an essential role in the initiation of the peace process  in particular by the convening of an international conference  with the participation of all the parties concerned  the great Powers and permanent members of the Security Council. Lastly  the Arab leaders showed at the extraordinary Summit their keen sense of responsibility and their desire for peace by vigorously denouncing terrorism in all its forms and whatever its origins  while reiterating their dedication to the principles of law and justice in defense of the legitimate cause of the Palestinian people. In this context  the Kingdom of Morocco will continue its support for the struggle of that people  under the leadership of the PLO  its sole  legitimate representative  for the recovery of its territories and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State.My country  which has always maintained fraternal relations with the Lebanese people  is grievously affected by the tragic events befalling it  with the almost daily quota of innocent victims and destruction. We reaffirm our support for respect of the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country  and we shall continue to work in all international forums to ensure that it recovers its stability and security and becomes once again the symbol of coexistence among the different communities concerned.The region is being wracked by another fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  setting two neighboring Moslem countries against each other and continuing in spite of many attempts at conciliation and mediation at the regional and global levels. Unfortunately  in spite of the hand held out many times by Iraq  Iran is showing great intransigence  frustrating the efforts made by the international community for the restoration of peaceful and good-neighborly relations between the two countries. We sincerely hope that for the sake of a common future inscribed in the facts of geography and history Iran will adopt a more flexible position and commit itself resolutely to the peace process.The situation in southern Africa lies at the center of the concerns of the international community as a whole. The irresponsible and short-sighted policy of the South African Government might bring about a real conflagration throughout the African continent and jeopardize international peace and security. We are faced here with a real challenge to the conscience of mankind since  in spite of numerous resolutions of our Organization and incessant appeals from humanitarian associations  the South African authorities persist in their illegal occupation of Namibia  maintain and strengthen their policy of apartheid  in violation of the most elementary rights of the human person  and engage periodically in acts of armed aggression against neighboring States.The fraternal Namibian people still live under the terror of a colonial and racist regime  eight years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  providing for a peaceful and democratic settlement  including the organization of free elections under the auspices of the United Nations. South Africa has contrived to confuse the issue and create new obstacles to Namibia's independence  while intensifying its military effort and oppressing the population.The Kingdom of Morocco  which has consistently lent its unreserved support to the struggle of the fraternal Namibian people  believes that we must redouble our efforts  at a time when we are commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the partition of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  in order to achieve the total emancipation of the Namibian people  with respect for their country's territorial integrity.Our full solidarity goes also  as in the past  to the population of South Africa which If  suffering under the yoke of racial discrimination  set up as a system of government  and which suffers the most shameless exploitation. At a time when we are witnessing an unprecedented intensification of the struggle of international public opinion  our Organization should mobilize all the means at its disposal in order to eliminate the anachronistic system of apartheid and put an end to one of the gravest sources of instability in Africa. Instead of taking cognizance of the inevitable evolution towards respect for the dignity of the human person and for democratic values. South Africa has  unfortunately  chosen to plunge ahead by directing its war machine against peaceful neighboring States.The Kingdom of Morocco condemns the external interventions  violations of sovereignty and State terrorism practiced by South Africa against Lesotho  Botswana  Mozambique and the People's Republic of Angola. The United Nations must apply the necessary sanctions under the appropriate provisions of the Charter.Similarly  we have constantly upheld the right of all countries freely to choose their political  economic and social systems  without external interference  whether in Afghanistan or in Kampuchea.The peoples of Central America are experiencing the difficulties of underdevelopment and facing the hazards of instability and foreign interference. The Kingdom of Morocco supports the efforts of the countries concerned to establish regional co-operation and eliminate any intervention in their internal affairs.The initiative in this regard of the Contadora Group  supported at Lima by other Latin American countries  deserves to be taken into consideration and to be encouraged by the international community  in order to achieve a normalization of relations between the Central American States concerned  on the basis of mutual respect  national sovereignty and territorial integrity.With regard to the region of North-west Africa  I beg the attention of our Assembly to touch on a problem of paramount importance for my country. Allow me to recall briefly the genesis of the so-called question of Western Sahara and to clarify the situation as it stands today.As everyone knows  it was on the initiative of Morocco that the United Nations was first seized of this question  as well as the question of Ifni  in 1963. The General Assembly  on 20 December 1965  first of all requested:""the Government of Spain  as the administering Power  immediately to take the necessary measures for the liberation of the Territories of Ifni and the Spanish Sahara from colonial domination  and to this end to enter into negotiations on the problems relating to sovereignty presented by these two Territories""  (resolution 2072 (XX)) While negotiations actually took place in the case of Ifni  which was reintegrated with the motherland in 1969  it was necessary to await the Madrid Agreement of 14 November 1975 in order to organize the definitive decolonization of Western Sahara.In order to frustrate that process  some parties called  in this very forum  for the holding of a referendum on self-determination  arguing that the consultation  on 28 February 1976  of the Sahara representative assembly  the Jema'a  was insufficient.The Kingdom of Morocco anticipated that demand  and His Majesty the Ring proposed to his African peers the holding of a referendum on self-determination  for the purpose of consulting the population of the Sahara under international supervision  and undertook to respect the results.The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was thus able to adopt unanimously  at its eighteenth summit meeting at Nairobi  resolution AHG/103 (XVIII) which noted with appreciation the solemn commitment made by His Majesty King Hassan II to accept the holding of a referendum in the territory of Western Sahara; decided to set up an Implementation Committee with full powers; urged the parties to the conflict to observe an immediate cease-fire; and requested the Implementation Committee to work out all the details relevant to the conduct and administration of the referendum.The Committee indeed carried out its task and finalized all the modalities at the two sessions in Nairobi  in August 1981 and February 1982  with the assistance of United Nations experts delegated by the Secretary-General.In order to hasten the carrying out of the referendum operation  only the date remaining to be established  the Moroccan Sovereign came before this Assembly  at its thirty-eighth session in 1983  to reiterate solemnly our Nairobi commitment and the readiness of the Kingdom of Morocco to collaborate  unconditionally and at any time  in the implementation of the African decisions.Why is it  then  that the Organization of African Unity should have opted  in violation of its Charter  for the admission of a fictitious republic  in disregard.Moreover  of all its previous positions and the wishes of the international community? In the circumstances  the Kingdom of Morocco had no choice but to withdraw from an Organization in which it had placed all its confidence and which had gone back on its decision by anticipating the population of the Sahara  thereby substituting itself for the expression of that people's authentic will.The Kingdom of Morocco is fully aware of the dangers that lie in wait for our African continent  in view of the many attempts at subversion and secession which have been promoted and which might be promoted in the future  by emphasis on the ethnic diversity and the fragility of most of the States. Our withdrawal from the OAU was  in fact  in the interest of Africa itself. We withdrew so as not to sanction a procedure the destabilizing effects of which might be of extreme gravity for a large number of African countries.In so doing  the Kingdom of Morocco  which was one of the sponsors of resolution 1514 (XV) on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the twenty-fifth anniversary of which we are celebrating this year  only expressed thereby its fidelity to the principle of self-determination.I should like to address myself here to our African brothers to tell them that it was not light-heartedly nor in a spirit of hostility and rupture with regard to Africa that Morocco was obliged to take the sad decision to withdraw from the Organization of African Unity. Furthermore  in a farewell message to the twentieth summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity in November 1984  the Moroccan Sovereign Hassan II expressed himself as follows:""Morocco is African  and African it will remain. All we Moroccans will remain in the service of Africa  in the Arab League for Arab-African co-operation  in the Non-Aligned Movement in order to defend the sovereignty of Africa  in the Organization of Islamic Conference in order to promote co-operation and mutual assistance in the revealed religions  and in the United Nations  where we shall be in the forefront to preserve the dignity of the African citizens and respect of our continent.""However  it is with regret that we are obliged to note today the failure of all the efforts made by the Organization of African unity to settle definitively this question of the Sahara which is henceforth at an impasse  as was pointed out by the Secretary-General himself in the report which he has just presented on this subject to our Assembly.We are even more comforted in this objective analysis of the situation by the statement made to the press by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria  in this very building  last Tuesday:""What brought us to imagine the Maghrebian framework and to work on the Morocco-Algerian dialog started when we became convinced that the African framework was no longer adequate  but Africa  faced with the fact that Morocco refused to implement the resolution  was forced  out of weariness - I repeat  weariness - to accept the Sahraoui Republic  even if Morocco stepped out of the room. But once again  we agree in saying that the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the Organization of African Unity does not solve the problem.""On this subject I ask the Assembly at least to take note of the Algerian agreement regarding the impasse at the African level  and to take into consideration the need to come back to the only forum which can help in solving the problem: the United Nations.The persistence of the present deadlock could lead to an aggravation of tension in the region and even to a conflict situation between two neighboring countries belonging to the same sphere of civilization and culture and united by centuries of common life and struggle. Whether they wish it or not  their fate  too  is a common one and can be realized only in the construction of a Maghreb community  based on solidarity and brought into being by the will of the people of the region.It is thus high time for the United Nations  which is still seized of this case and has experience of the appropriate logistics  to regain the initiative in order to ensure that the referendum on self-determination is held as soon as possible. We have full confidence in the ability of the Secretary-General  who has already on several occasions assumed the role of mediator in order to bring parties together and defuse crisis situations. In our view  the Secretary-General should be encouraged in any initiative which he sees fit to take  in particular in co-operation with the incumbent President and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and with all the parties concerned with the definitive settlement of this question. The Kingdom of Morocco reaffirms its complete readiness to assist the Secretary-General and collaborate fully in the holding of a free and democratic referendum  under the auspices of the United Nations  and its commitment to respect the result of such referendum.Let us hope that this session  which commemorates the fortieth anniversary of our Organization and is one of balance-sheets and hopes  will open the way toMorocco? a definitive and just solution of this question and to the creation of a new climate of appeasement in the region.In conclusion  at the time when we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of our Organization we must clearly recognize that our world continues to be prey to selfishness and intolerance.In the face of the nuclear peril  the frantic arms race  the increasing rigidity of ideological blocks  the demographic explosion  the squandering of the natural resources of the planet and  above all  the absence of any clear prospects for the development of large sections of disinherited humanity  how can one be surprised at the anxiety of today's youth  its despair in the face of the uncertainties of the future and its recourse to extreme positions  whether on the religious level or with regard to political and economic allegiance.As we examine the balance-sheet  we must note with regret that our Organization  during its 40 years of existence  has failed to take account in its work of the spiritual dimension of man. How can one fail to recognize that types of materialism of all shades have been unable to coexist peacefully or to resolve the human equation on a lasting basis?Our universe is immersed in models of consumption that are impossible to universalize  whereas the revealed religions remind us that the life of human communities must not be reduced to the satisfaction of economic needs alone. When receiving His Holiness the Pope recently  His Majesty the King of Morocco and the Moroccan people presented to the world an Islam open and modern  tolerant  opposed to fanaticism and intolerance. We have a profound conviction that the reconciliation of spiritual beliefs and the dialog between religions constitute factors of peace capable of transcending present conflicts and laying the foundations of a better world for future generations.It is therefore urgently necessary for the United Nations to assume a more dynamic role in the restoration of the essential values of humanity  in order to personify  at the dawn of the twenty-first century  the hope of a new human order that reconciles man with himself."
"77",4437,"MDG",40,1985,"Owing to professional chance and our convergent interests  I have had the good fortune to know Ambassador de Pinies for many years. It is with rare pleasure that I convey to him the heartfelt congratulations of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fortieth session. I am certain that his rich experience in international affairs and his qualities as a statesman will help to ensure that our work meets with the success that we all desire.To our brother  His Excellency Mr. Paul Lusaka  we renew our expressions of pride and satisfaction at the ability  effectiveness and calmness with which he presided over the work of the thirty-ninth session.We pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General for the many initiatives he has taken in the cause of peace and on behalf of countries which by nature or fate has not favored.Z wish also  on behalf of ray delegation  to request the delegation of Mexico to convey our sympathy and support to its Government and our condolences to the families which have suffered so greatly as a result of the earthquakes which recently ravaged Mexico.It has often been said that the vision of the founders of our Organization and their attitude to our collective future were not basically different from our own. Their philosophy was based on two premises: the wisdom of nations and the balanced division of responsibilities in the moral and material reconstruction of a world plunged into indescribable chaos by the ravages of war and fascist totalitarian ideologies. They had to restructure international relations in order to safeguard a peace which had been won through enormous sacrifices  to ensure economic recovery  to promote the social progress of peoples and to guarantee human rights. Finally  to crown it all  an international authority was to see to it that the actions of nations in furtherance of the purposes of the Charter would be co-ordinated and harmonized. That was the scenario for a better world  in which all peoples would feel safe and States would undertake to subordinate the promotion of their own interests to the quest for the common good.Once the facts had been established  the norms promulgated and the means defined  it was our job to build upon them. But 40 years later we are still wondering whether the vision of our predecessors was not too idealistic  whether our Organization is still relevant and whether we have failed in the mission bequeathed to us. The principles remain valid  while priorities have been rearranged and the perception of our goals has changed in the light of positive and negative developments in the world situation. Nevertheless  our heritage has not been excessively compromised  and we must undertake a periodic evaluation  which will form the framework for our discussions as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of our Organization.This anniversary coincides with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  to the drafting of which all contributed  in particular the Afro-Asian  Latin American and socialist countries. Since 1960  more than 70 of us have achieved sovereignty or recovered it. Thus  our full participation in international affairs has been directly or indirectly fostered by the adoption of that Declaration  which represents the culmination of the struggle waged by the democratic forces and the expression of the solidarity among peoples.Some would say that decolonization  which is an inevitable  irreversible historical process  would have come about even had the United Nations not existed. It is sufficient to list the cases of decolonization between the two world wars and recall the insistence with which we invoked the Charter during the anti-colonial struggle to be convinced of the opposite. Certainly  it is in the field of decolonization that the United Nations has succeeded in playing its role as a center for the co-ordination of efforts  to the extent that preconditions  hesitations and ambiguities have given way to reason.The same could have been said of Namibia  where so many hopes have always been pinned on the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the joint action of the United Nations Council for Namibia  the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia and the Special Committee of 24  to all of which we pay a tribute. We have identified the obstacles and they are all the fault of the Pretoria regime: the continued illegal occupation of an international Territory; the absurd linkage between the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and the obligation of a usurper regime to give back what does not belong to it; the continued acts of aggression against the front-line States} the installation of a so-called interim administration; and the authorization given to national and transnational corporations to engage in excessive exploitation of the resources of the Territory.All the means prescribed in Chapter VI of the Charter have been exhausted  and implementation of Article 41. has even begun. It is time for us seriously to consider binding sanctions and recourse to Article 42 if we wish to establish the authority of the Organization and prove to international public opinion and the South West Africa people's Organization (SWAPO)  which is recognized as the sole authentic and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  that we want  and are able  to fulfill our responsibilities.Recently there has been talk of the adverse effects of sanctions and reference has been made to history and to economic and humanitarian considerations. Until total independence is won  the Namibian people  like any other struggling people  is ready to make sacrifices.It would be scandalous if  through our omissions and procrastination and the absence of true solidarity on the part of some of us  those sacrifices were in vain and the Pretoria regime managed to impose its own solution.Another act of decolonization to be achieved relates to western Sahara. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have recognized that the United Nations can make a major contribution to establishing a process and a mechanism which will make possible the effective exercise by the Sahraoui people of their legitimate sovereign rights. Direct negotiations between the two parties  the Kingdom of Morocco and the EOLISARIO Front  would eliminate the threats to peace  stability and security in the region.The United Nations can be proud of its work in the field of decolonization and can commit itself to continuing that work until the colonial phenomenon has been totally eradicated  but can the same be said about development and the elimination of economic and social inequality? The network of institutions and organizations dealing with international economic  social and cultural co-operation is widespread and interlinked. We agreed  after arduous negotiations  to focus our action on integrated national development  the restructuring of economic relations among nations and the development of world economic security. None of those provisions violates the purposes or principles of the Charter  in particular those set forth in Chapter IX. Yet the results are mixed  not to say disappointing  mainly because of the changes that successive crises have imposed on priorities.Thus  the idea of world economic security  which logically should have been our prime concern  has not always been supported by some among us. It has sometimes been ill -defined  sometimes complex  sometimes controversial  and often  on various pretexts  it has been reduced to some of its aspects that have been wisely referred to as instances of the interdependence of nations and problems. This could lead to excessive subordination or to conflicts of interest; and that when considered from the viewpoint of individual or collective selfishness  is inevitably reflected in a general imbalance and a gradual erosion of international economic co-operation - a phenomenon that in its turn has brought about marginalization  backwardness and the increasing impoverishment of the majority of the nations of the world.It is therefore natural that the struggle of the third world to reverse this trend continues. It started with our demand for a new international economic order and the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. It will go on until we are sure that the international negotiations will lead to acceptance of the idea of economic security for all  because  if we accept the axiom that there is no development without security and no security without development  we must acknowledge that our actions must be simultaneous and not consecutive.In any case  what security or development  whether integrated or not  can we boast of when we face inextricable  nightmarish debt problems? Is it not true that in the majority of cases the debt was incurred to ensure for our peoples more rapid development  more equitable at the international level and better distributed at the national level? Is it not true that we continue to be the victims of the erratic prices of raw materials  unfavorable terms of trade  fluctuations in interest and exchange rates and  recently  the too high priority accorded by banks and financial institutions to ideas of profitability?Since the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in New Delhi 21 years ago  it could be said that we have enjoyed rehashing the same arguments  we could reply that we have not always found the necessary understanding in our partners to remove obstacles in situations whose urgency and acuteness might have escaped them  we do not wish to dwell at length on missed opportunities. We assume it is agreed that the present discussion falls within the framework of a continuing significant consensus that the United Nations cannottolerate any further fragmentation of negotiations and of the decision-making system.Two major challenges remain to be met: the critical economic situation in Africa and the problems of indebtedness and financing for development.In Africa  disease  famine  malnutrition and poverty remain widespread. Twenty-one countries and 205 million inhabitants re still affected by drought. Domestic production and rates of growth have continually fallen since 1980. Serious balance-of-payments difficulties still exist and debt servicing alone  evaluated at $158 billion in 1984  is jeopardizing development and stability.Over and above emergency assistance  the co-ordination of which is fortunately handled by the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa  the seriousness of these problems makes joint action by Africa and the international community necessary to revive  inter alia  long-term development and economic growth and to ensure appropriate structural reforms. African Heads of State and Government have made specific proposals in this connection  such as the convening of a United Nations conference on the economic situation in Africa  the organization of a conference on African debt and the establishment of special funds for Africa.The negative development of the economic situation has compelled us to call for the speedy convening of an international conference on money and finance for development. A process of consultation would be established between debtors and creditors to agree on more flexible measures for rescheduling and the adjustment of modalities for granting official development assistance. But  despite the moratoriums  rescheduling and structural adjustments  questions of development and financing will not be satisfactorily resolved until the problem of indebtedness is resolved.We are shocked and overwhelmed by what we do not hesitate to call the scandal of the century - the fact that the net transfer of capital to the developing countries was $180 billion from 1978 to 1983  but became negative in 1984 and that the world debt amounts to approximately $900 billion  whereas military expenditures amounted to $820 billion for 1984 alone.The figures speak for themselves  and it is difficult to resist simplistic equations  particularly since few nations would agree to sacrifice their security for the development of others. But it would be wrong for us not to stress the link between development and disarmament. The study requested by the United Nations on the allocation to development purposes of funds released by disarmament was published 23 years ago  and where are we now? In times of political crisis  development is relegated to second place and that concept has been overshadowed by the emphasis nations place on strengthening their military security either individually or in the framework of existing alliances  which naturally implies recognition of the failure of the collective security system envisaged in the Charter.Development  disarmament and security are for us aspects o£ the same situation. They must be the concern of us all  not merely of some Powers or of the the two blocs. That is why we have always advocated that the right place for finding a solution to these problems must be the United Nations. According to Article 26 of the Charter:""... the Security Council shall be responsible for formulating... plans to be submitted to the Members of the United Nations for the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments""  and Article 11 says that:""The General Assembly may consider... the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments  and may make recommendations with regard to such principles to the Members or to the Security Council or to both"".The constitutional provisions and the relevant machinery exist  but in practice two Powers take care of everything with  from time to time  consultation of the members of the two alliances  and the United Nations is reduced to a marginal role. This marginalization cannot continue because at some point it will challenge the consensus we achieved with regard to the limitation  control  reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons.We cannot avoid the complexity of the problem  given the conditions inherent to each stage and the transition from one stage to another. As soon as some progress is made in limitation  difficulties arise at the level of verification  research and development bring about a revision of the ceiling of limitation and of the list of types of weapons concerned  and reduction is seen in the context of political criteria and  therefore  subordinated to the evolution of the relationship between the military or nuclear Powers. Uncertainty is the rule  and we cannot blame propaganda alone for the favorable reactions of international public opinion when we talk of zones of peace  such as the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean  a freeze in the deployment of new weapons  moratoriums  zones free from chemical or nuclear weapons and the non-militarization of environments considered to be the common heritage of mankind  that is  the sea-bed  the ocean floor and outer space.Disarmament is too important to be left in the hands of technicians alone. More than ever before  political action is necessary and urgent. It is time for the United Nations to play the role of initiator and prime mover in establishing mutual trust among the nuclear Powers and for it to be included in bilateral discussions  directly and through providing it with appropriate information.He base ourselves on the same mutual trust when we speak of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Already certain Powers - and major ones at that - are allowed to escape the constraints of that Treaty  but distrust persists vis-a-vis the signatories  who intend to place nuclear energy at the service of development  and no mention is made of article VI of the Treaty  whereby the nuclear Powers have undertaken to conduct negotiations in good faith in order to eliminate nuclear weapons. If everyone fulfilled their obligations  the Treaty would be more fully respected.In the field of conventional disarmament  what we have just said about the role of the United Nations is valid here too. However  we must bear in mind the new dimensions - namely  the existence and continuation of conflicts and tensions  as well as the responsibility and the ability of the United Nations to prevent them and resolve them. In principle  if the conditions of military  political and economic security were met  and if at all times in all places and at all times there was a spirit of amity  tolerance and good neighborliness  peaceful coexistence and principles relating to international sovereignty  territorial integrity  non-interference  respect and mutual advantage  we could then say that conflicts and tensions would disappear.But the facts have produced a different situation. National interest has not yet managed to blend with general interest. Our society	although claiming universality  is still human with all its strengths weaknesses. The States concerned themselves hesitate to bring their disputes t n international forum  while the United Nations is not sure of its authority and of the adequacy of the means made available to it by the Member States.We are devoted to the cardinal principle of peaceful negotiated settlement of disputes. Although everything hinges on the kind of dispute and on the readiness of the States concerned  we must provide for a certain measure of flexibility and not stick blindly to the order in which the means are enumerated in the Charter. Hence we continue to believe that  in the context of the development of international law  it is desirable that some categories of conflicts be submitted to binding arbitration.It is not unreasonable to think that such a procedure would have a positive effect on a peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean homeland  without foreign interference; on the war between Iran and Iraq  which might be settled round a conference table even after all efforts at conciliation and mediation had unfortunately failed; on the search for a political solution to the deadlocks in South-East Asia  Central America  the.Caribbean and South America; and on the situation in Cyprus  where a solution entails respect for the relevant United Nations resolutions and for the sovereignty  unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. Some seek shelter behind the provisions of the Charter in order to entrust the task of settling some of these conflicts to regional and sub-regional bodies; but sooner or later there will be leveled against us the accusation that we are more likely to generate and maintain crises than to defuse then.The experience of the past 40 years has put us to the test with regard to the question of the Middle East and the situation in South Africa  matters on which world public opinion has judged and continues to judge us rather harshly.In the Middle East  the context  the conditions and the machinery for a settlement do exist. Despite our efforts  the cycle of violence continues  to such an extent that the very existence of Lebanon is threatened. The rights of a people for which we have a special responsibility are being negotiated at the whim of alliances and of strategic or ideological interests  under the cover of various plans which leave us somewhat skeptical. Are we from now on to understand that the United Nations plan for the final settlement of the Palestinian problem is doomed to oblivion in the Security Council? Are we to be satisfied with expediency which  because of its very nature and its inoperative character  merely strengthens Israeli intransigence? Were this to be so  we would be creating an irreversible situation to the benefit of hegemonism and exclusivism.The fortieth anniversary of the Organization affords us an opportunity to reconsider the overall question of the Middle East and in particular the question of Palestine  and to relaunch the international conference in which the Palestinians must participate on an equal footing with the other parties  in keeping with resolution 3375 (XXX) of 10 November 1975. We are convinced that a settlement of the question of Palestine founded on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people is the key element of an overall political settlement of the conflict in the Middle East - the establishment of which cannot be realized without removing the ostracism in which some have placed the Palestine Liberation Organization.The situation is no different in South Africa  for we have allowed it to deteriorate through our indecision and our .jppsaseEent of the apartheid regime  we are witnessing a real political and social revolution  involving the African National Congress of South Africa  the forces of liberation and of the struggle against apartheid  students  young people  trade unionists and religious circles. Some see foreign intervention there. Others  such as we ourselves  are convinced that it is a revolution above all African-inspired for the advent of a just and democratic society.It was to be expected that reactionary circles would rush to support certain reforms and half-measures to turn the South African revolution away from its objectives and preserve the established order. It would have been more logical  however little some may be faithful to our principles  to return to the spirit of 1945 and to recognize that the creation of our Organization was also a revolution  born of the determination to put an end for ever to the new order that fascism and Nazism wanted to impose upon us.We have noticed that  as in every general debate  we have been unable to resist the temptation to get out old files  to go through them  add what we believe to be new elements and remove what seems to be no longer relevant. That exercise  which lawyers entrust to their clerks  sometimes allows us to obtain information whose wise and timely use permits us to draw conclusions supporting our argument and then to regard the file as closed. But we have not come here mainly to make demands  argue our case or pass judgment. Our approach continues to be political; our desire is to find solutions  and therefore one can well understand our frustration when at the en.* of the session  or even during the course of it  the files are put away and closed  only to be reopened for use in other debates.However  the current session to some extent lades the sense of futility to which unfortunately we have become accustomed. Indeed  we are convinced that our thoughts should be devoted to defining the conditions for the creation of a better world for future generations. It might be wondered whether there exists a better world than that in which we live  which  after all  has been free of world war for two generations  a world which  we are told  enjoys globally a prosperity unmatched in human history  a world in which science and technology are at our service - but also unfortunately a world where there are more shadows than rays of light.However  it is quite natural for a given society at each stage of its development to regard itself as the best. Here it is sufficient to recall the Age of Enlightenment. But  just as a nation is dedicated to striving to develop and flourish  the destiny of the international society is to surpass its previous achievements. In that context  we say: Yes  there will always be a better world than that which it suggested to us  and better than the one we leave behind. That is our vision. It is not merely wishful thinking  but will be the outcome of the dynamic of history. It is our hope that present and future realities will reflect it better.I wish to conclude by reading out to the Assembly a few extracts from the message sent by Mr. Didier Ratsiraka  President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  to the Secretary-General on 8 May  as follows:""When the international community is commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the victory over Nazism and fascism at the end of the Second World War  the struggle waged against them  the people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar once again reaffirm their firm adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and recognize the need to support and strengthen the United Nations in order to make it aneffective instrument which can play its crucial role in the maintenance of international peace and security... The struggle against all forms of injustice  racial discrimination and Fascist ideologies and practices is oneMadagascar. The people and the Government of Madagascar have always been opposed to fascism and all other forms of totalitarian ideologies and practices based on intolerance  hatred and racial terror  and all forms of domination and hegemony.""He are convinced that  despite all the difficulties it encounters  the United Nations will develop between nations friendly relations based on respect for the principle of equality of the rights of peoples and their right to self-determination  and will achieve international co-operation by developing and fostering respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and will be able to preserve peace for mankind as a whole."""
"78",4521,"MEX",40,1985,"President Miguel de la Madrid had intended to bring to this body Mexico's message on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Last week's tragic events have prompted hist to remain in Mexico. The President felt that in this hour of grief his place was at the side of the Mexican people. The President has therefore instructed roe to submit to the Assembly some of the theses and proposals which he would have set forth. He has asked me also to express the deep and lasting gratitude of the people and Government of Mexico for the countless expressions of solidarity and concrete support which we have received from so many friendly countries. In particular  he has asked me to reiterate his gratitude to the Heads of State or Government as well as those other distinguished figures and international officials who have traveled to our capital for that purpose  and to express his thanks to the heads of delegation that have so generously referred to this question from this rostrum. Finally  I have been asked to thank on his behalf all Member States for the decision adopted yesterday by the General Assembly. Mexico is in mourning  but finds comfort in its grief in the fraternal embrace of the international community.Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of the Government and people of Mexico  to express to you my sincere congratulations on your election to the post you now hold. That election confirms Spain's importance in international relations and is  at the same time  a well-deserved recognition of the work of Ambassador Jaime de Pinies. Permit me to offer my best wishes that the work of this Assembly  under your wise leadership  will culminate in the success we all hope for.I should also like to note publicly our satisfaction with the effective way in which Ambassador Paul Lusaka accomplished the task of presiding over the work of the last session of the General Assembly.Mr. Secretary-General  the United Nations has conferred upon you the responsibility of guiding this organization at a moment that is crucial for the community of nations. The report you have presented to the General Assembly gives proof of your tenacious determination to bring about the complete fulfillment of its objectives. Mexico fully appreciates your efforts to solve the problems that today affect international concord. My country resolutely supports your tireless work on behalf of peace and development.Four decades ago  when 51 nations adopted the United Nations Charter  the world was just emerging from the cruelest devastation mankind had ever faced. The experience of the Second World War had shown the need to create structures for co-operation that world prevent the scourge of war and its aftermath of suffering.In 1945 the world community resolved to establish guiding principles for the conduct of States  to promote respect for the fundamental rights of individuals and peoples  and to expand multilateral co-operation. The United Nations mechanism which thus emerged was one of the greatest political achievements in history.To a great extent  today's world is a product of our organization. It was thanks to the support of the United Nations that many of the countries represented here today achieved their sovereignty. The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted in 1960  was a political event of decisive importance. Without it self-determination would have exacted a heavier price in blood and worsened existing world tensions.We owe it to the United Nations that development is today an essential concern of the community of nations. The system provides the most appropriate mechanism for channeling economic and technical co-operation to the benefit of the less-favored countries. The Organization's work of furthering the evolution of the international juridical order is a similar soiree of unanimous recognition. Its contribution to the cause of universal respect for human rights is particularly outstanding.Nor should we forget the work of the Organization in resolving political conflicts and armed confrontations. It has frequently been a useful instrument in defusing hostilities that would have led to more serious clashes. In the global confrontation  the United Nations has also been a factor in promoting detente and dialog; its perseverance has prevented universal destruction.The United Nations has broadened areas of understanding and has provided a normative order that does away with the law of the jungle and protects weak countries. Without its presence  the tensions and inequalities facing us would have been greater.This is an appropriate occasion to recognize that in its 40 years of existence our Organization has succeeded in shaping institutions and promoting programs benefiting children  young people and women; it has sought to improve health  labor conditions  dietary levels  education and culture  to the benefit of mankind. This Organization's work in the field of population problems is also outstanding.Mexico repeats its firm commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations  which coincide with the historical doctrine of my country's foreign policy. In our opinion  this is by far the best forum for joining the political wills of States to foster the values that are a distinctive characteristic of civilization.In 1945  at the Chapultepee Conference  the nations of Latin America co-ordinated their points of view on the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. We then suggested measures to strengthen the General Assembly and to expand its authority in matters of security and peace. We maintained that the United Nations should reflect the ideals of universality  equality before the law  democracy and respect for the law. We also expressed Latin America's concern about the need for our Organization to be given the instruments to permit it to carry out its activities effectively.Unfortunately  the Latin American ideals were to be faced with the reality of an unequal distribution of power. The Powers that had been victorious in the Second World War sought primarily to safeguard their own interests rather than to attend to the needs of the developing countries. Bipolar attitudes have marked the life of the Organization ever since.In addition  the political map of the world has been radically transformed. Today 159 States hold seats in this forum. The development of the majority of countries still urgently requires action  various regions are suffering grave economic and political crises and even warlike confrontations  and the United Nations is not always able to provide satisfactory solutions.Thus we should not be surprised that there is discouragement when obstacles are placed in the path of measures needed to maintain peace and security. The difficulties involved in establishing a new ordering of economic and political relations between States give rise  equally  to despair and skepticism.We must also recognize that accusations and confrontation have often prevailed over negotiation and pragmatic means of obtaining results. It must be admitted that this tendency weakens the United Nations and feeds mistrust and frustration.These reflections should not lead us to underestimate the value of multilateral forums. That is certainly not my intention. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations offers an exceptional opportunity to draw up a balance sheet of achievements and limitations  to examine the system and correct its shortcomings. I am sure that the community of nations expects such an effort at renewal to be made for the purpose of improving international relations.We must assume our respective responsibilities for ensuring the full effectiveness of this Organization. We are well aware that it will not be easy to obtain a meeting of minds  but we are convinced that that is the only way for the purposes of the United Nations to be fully realized.We all have an obligation to give way on less important matters in order to reach agreement on what is basic. A constructive approach and a search for practical solutions are urgently needed. It is imperative  too  that the great Powers ponder more carefully their use of the right of veto  as well as showing a real willingness to enter into dialog to reduce global tensions and demonstrate a greater understanding of the problems of developing nations.It is inadmissible that any State should endeavor to shape the international system to its own ends  or try  either openly or surreptitiously  to impose or induce the adoption of its own political system by other countries. The confrontation between East and West encourages political submission and imposes alignments that stand in the way of peace and world democracy. Frequently  outside interference prevents the peaceful solution of regional conflicts and promotes confrontation between brother nations. The unproductive stockpiling of arms resulting from the desire to dominate forecloses valid development options.Those who seek hegemony have used the mirage of privileged relations to undermine the solidarity of others. Thus our genuine independence is jeopardized and circumscribed. As the twentieth century draws to a close  it is not possible to accept supposed rights of supremacy or spheres of influence that undermine sovereignty and limit self-determination.The effectiveness of the United Nations depends on the will of its members. Lasting peace can be achieved only if efforts to dominate are renounced and if we recognize that coexiste  in a plural world is based on respect for law and on satisfying the needs of the peoples. Security demands that we solve controversies through political and diplomatic actions  and  therefore  that we abstain from the use of force. Equitable development is predicated on solidarity and the giving up of privileges. As I make these observations  I think of Benito Suarez  Mexico's great statesman  who said:""Among individuals  as among nations  respect for the rights of others is peace"".Unequal opportunities and confrontations generate an explosive situation that threatens the fragile stability of international society. The united Nations is our sole recourse to keep us from relapsing into savagery and to permit us to live according to reason and political wisdom. I am convinced that only in this universal forum can we offer a common hope of survival and well-being to present and future generations.On this solemn occasion my words are meant to call upon the sense of responsibility of all Governments. The history of civilization teaches us that the future cannot be made subject to the demands of immediate power. We must remember that a world conflagration would make a new Renaissance impossible. For that reason  the purposes and principles of the Charter are more relevant today than ever before.The shortcomings of the Organization can be overcome with a creative spirit and vision  of the future. The options are clear: either we strengthen our institutions or we face the risk of international anarchy.In the years following the Second World War the international community  mindful of the lessons of history  and exercising political will  decided to prevent a recurrence of the economic events of the 1930s  which were  to a large extent  the principal causes of the most destructive war the world has ever known. The 1930s were marked by a severe recession  uncertainty  monetary and trade instability  disarray in the financial markets and lack of economic co-operation. Each country tried to solve its problems alone and to export them to other countries  upon the cessation of hostilities in 1945  in a demonstration of co-operation that was also without precedent  there was a transfer of real resources for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan that saved the countries involved from famine and did much to promote their remarkable recovery.In a climate of dialog and economic co-operation between the majority of the countries that were independent at that time  there began in the 1950s a period lasting almost 20 years in which the world economy was characterized by relative monetary stability  by flows of finance that  although still insufficient  promoted development  and by a growing expansion of trade. That co-operation  although not wholly inadequate  permitted advances and improvements in the levels of well-being of the industrialized countries and  to a lesser degree  of the developing countries.The world economy today shows signs of great uncertainty. The economic recovery in the industrialized world  which began in 1983  has not had enough impetus to reach the developing countries. What is more  the pace of recovery is now beginning to show signs of slackening. There has been a significant drop in the prices of primary products  worsening the terms of trade of the developing countries and making their prospects of economic progress gloomy.The slowdown in the international economy has created Mounting tensions. The threat persists that the world economy will become fragmented as pressures increase to adopt protectionist measures that would do particular harm to the developing countries.Interest rates in the principal financial centers remain high and inhibit the channeling of resources into productive investments. Instability and speculation have persisted in the exchange markets.Today  faced with the hesitant evolution of the world economy  direction has been lost and prosperity has been jeopardized. Consequently  to the developing countries and particularly to Latin America  an international monetary system which  instead of creating certainty and productive investment  gives rise to the instability of exchange rates  inflation and speculation  is not acceptable.An international financial system which  instead of promoting a flow of resources that would contribute to economic and social development  gives rise to a greater concentration of wealth and the de-capitalization of countries that represent more than three fourths of the world population  is not acceptable.An international trade system which  instead of encouraging efficiency and the utilization of comparative advantages  gives rise to protectionism and isolation and relegates developing countries to the simple role of providing raw materials and goods of little added value  is not acceptable.In a world that is more interdependent than it was 40 years ago  the lack of sufficient will to solve the problems confronted by the world economy by employing effective co-operation systems is not acceptable.The unfavorable international economic climate has hindered the efforts undertaken by developing countries to improve their standards of living. A steadfast battle is being waged against inflation and internal and external imbalances  while  at the same time  efforts are being made to reactivate the productive apparatus  increase exports and maintain the most essential social investments. In the developing countries  our actions have demonstrated our acceptance that there can be no substitute for our own internal efforts to confront our problems.Those internal efforts are unprecedented  but their success depends on receiving greater support from the international community. Paradoxically  our adjustment measures have met with no equivalent counterpart in the most developed economies. Efforts to export are met with trade restrictions and the need for resources is responded to with limited and burdensome financing and inadequate investment and transfer of technology.Increased dialog and the holding of multilateral negotiations are imperative if we are to solve the great economic problems afflicting the world and turn economic co-operation from words into actual fact.The international monetary system must be revised without delay to recover the stability lost  to create a climate conducive to productive investment and to stimulate world trade. Every effort must be made to ensure that the correction of disparities in the balance of payments is even-handed  distributing the burden of the adjustment process between the developing and the industrialized countries  between the nations with a deficit and those with a surplus.Equitable distribution of costs and benefits within a world economic system is a basic premise for the prosperity of all. In finance  as in trade  it is essential to recognize different levels of development as an element on which the principle of equity is based.The financial system should be capable of channeling resources under terms and in amounts that are concordant with development needs. In recent years the developing countries  and particularly those of Latin America  have had to use credits from the commercial banking system  in which terms and interest rates are not the most suitable for development purposes. This has been caused by the lack of development funds negotiated through bilateral and multilateral agreements. Ironically  resources that should have been directed towards improving the well-being of mankind have been channeled into an arms race that threatens our survival and distorts economies.The foreign debt problem of Latin America and of other developing countries cannot be definitively solved through rescheduling that grants only temporary relief to the debtor countries and to the international community. If we are to pay  we must have growth.There is a real need for a dialog between representatives of debtor and creditor countries  international private banks and world financing agencies as a means of devising formulas that acknowledge shared responsibilities and reconcile the various interests with a view to revitalizing the world economy and permitting more equitable levels of development.What is required is to design a global strategy that includes the transfer of new funding under suitable terms and conditions so as to achieve the reactivation of world trade  the elimination of protectionist barriers against the exports of the debtor countries and the reconversion  of industry with a view to utilizing the comparative advantages existing throughout the world.In the field of international trade  and particularly at the next round of negotiations that will begin in 1986  it is essential to obtain preferential treatment for the products of developing countries  so as to allow them to export and thereby reach a rate of development that will make it possible for them to meet their growing domestic demands and fulfill their commitments abroad.Monetary  financial and trade problems form the dangerous structure on which the world economy now rests. Dialog and negotiation  not confrontation  are the basic elements for seeking solutions. The international community  its leaders and the United Nations must all be called upon to join in a great exercise of political will for the purpose of structuring reform programs that  like those of 40 yearsago  will prevent crisis and conflagration. The developing world  which represents more than 30 per cent of world economic activity and more than 75 per cent of the world population  now needs a bold and imaginative program to reactivate and transfer real resources in order to deal with hunger  ignorance and the heavy debt burden and thus to achieve a solid world economy with a better distribution of its benefits.Latin America also demands negotiated solutions to the tensions that are endangering peace in the region. The efforts of the Contadora Group  undertaken by my country  together with Colombia  Panama and Venezuela  in order to prevent a generalized conflagration are a Latin American response to eminently Latin American problems.We insist anew that the roots of Central America's problems lie in the region's needs and lagging social and economic development that have caused the instability of the political institutions of the area. None the less  we cannot fail to recognize that the conflict implies geopolitical considerations of zones of influence and strategic balance; nor is it possible to ignore the fact that the cessation of foreign interference is a decisive condition for achieving any peaceful settlement in Central America.Nevertheless  we stand firm in cur conviction that the deepest causes of the confrontations in Central America are endogenous and should be isolated from the context of East-West confrontation.The Contadora Group has set itself to find political and diplomatic formulas that will protect the legitimate interests of all the Central American nations and safeguard their right to self-determination and independence. We are not alone inour efforts. The establishment of a support group  formed by Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  demonstrates Latin America's rejection of the use of force and foreign intervention of any origin in Central America.Although signing a legal instrument is clearly not enough to ensure peace and development in the area  the Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America is  in our opinion  a viable means of preventing war and intervention in the zone. That is why we appeal to all the countries of the region to step up negotiations leading to the prompt signing of the Act. He also urge nations with links and interests in Central America to support agreement among the nations of Central America and to abstain from any measure that could worsen the situation.Political decisiveness and good faith are undoubted requisites for the re-establishment of bases for communication among the Governments of the region. The will of the Central American nations is an essential element in any understanding. There can be no doubt that bilateral contacts would reinforce the Contadora Group's negotiations on behalf of a Central American agreement.Central America has a right to well-being and to live free from the spectre of a war that would only bring about death and devastation in an area that is already suffering the daily occurrence of irreparable loss of human life and resources. Solutions imposed by force  reaching beyond any immediate illusions  would only contribute to perpetuating and extending regional instability. Peace is an indispensable prerequisite for consolidating political institutions that will promote democracy and social and economic development.The Government of Mexico wishes to express its gratitude to the General Assembly for the support it has given the Contadora Group's efforts. That support commits us to persevere in efforts to bring about peace. We are confident that the unanimous support expressed by the international community will persuade the Central American Governments and those involved in the conflict to allow law to prevail over force and the power of politics over the politics of power.Mexico has noted with concern the new impetus in the nuclear and conventional arms races. Distrust between the super-Powers is encouraging a quest for technological and military supremacy that in turn causes ever greater distrust. As a result  a dynamic increase in tensions and in the stockpiling of weapons is produced  increasing the risk of a conflagration.The fear of falling behind in the competition to achieve the greatest preparedness for war could lead to the mistake of attempting a first strike that precludes retaliation. Worse still  the missiles of today  with their complex computerized data systems for guiding both offensive and defensive launches  increase the chances of an accident that could trigger the holocaust.Mankind would seem to be hovering on the threshold of its own annihilation. In the face of the nuclear danger  no one c n encourage false hopes of survival. The conclusions of the most recent scientific research are unanimous: a nuclear war would mean the end. of intelligent life  and possibly of all forms of life  on the surface of our planet.Nuclear disarmament concerns all peoples. Hence  in January of this year  Mexico  together with Argentina  Greece  India  Sweden and the United Republic of Tanzania  called upon the Powers possessing nuclear weapons to take steps urgently towards reversing and bringing to a halt the senseless escalation of the arms race.The logic of deterrence and the balance of force at constantly increasing levels of destructive potential must now be replaced by successive  step-by-step political agreements that take legitimate security needs into account  gradually reduce the danger of extermination and finally lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons.Recently the world marked the fortieth anniversary of the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then  nuclear weapons have caused a qualitative alteration of the international scene. Modern arsenals of war are not the unexpected result of scientific and technological advances but rather the product and instrument of political decisions. Technology in itself is powerless to eliminate the threat that hangs over civilization. From now on the continuity of history depends on agreement and disarmament - in other words  on forthright political action that will reverse the momentum of the slide towards disaster.We insist that the stockpiling of arms frustrates hopes of improved well-being and squanders resources that could satisfy the basic needs of the majority of the world's people. It is also a factor in the prevailing disarray in the international financial  market. Thus the extent of world poverty is undeniably linked to the magnitude of military spending.It is tins to call a halt to this foolish and dramatic course towards war. The super-Powers must make straightforward commitments in the task of nuclear disarmament. All States alike share the responsibility for putting an end to the stockpiling of increasingly sophisticated and lethal conventional weapons.We hope that the Geneva talks between the United States and the Soviet Union will prevent the vertical proliferation of strategic arsenals  which might become irreversible  and instead encourage their progressive dismantlement. We are confident that the world community will revitalize multilateral disarmament forums and promote new regional arms limitation programs. This is essential if we are to safeguard man's rich heritage and future generations  which otherwise may never exist.Global confrontations exacerbate regional conflicts and endanger international peace and security.In America  the Malvinas continue to be the subject of a sovereignty dispute. My delegation takes this occasion to renew its support for the historic rights of the Argentine nation and once again calls upon the parties to begin negotiations leading to a settlement of the controversy.In 1985 South Africa still suffers systematic human rights violations. During the past months the repression of civil protest movements has further discredited the apartheid system. Moreover  South Africa continues to prevent the people of Namibia from attaining full independence. Mexico condemns the racist Pretoria regime and urges all States to implement the various Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on that country.The right of all States in the Middle East to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination continue to preoccupy the international community. The national integrity of Lebanon has fallen victim to the regional and extra-regional power politics that prevail in that area. The war between Iran and Iraq has introduced an additional element of instability. Terrorist tactics and indiscriminate reprisals that harm innocent people deepen antagonisms between groups and nations and replace legitimate political action by arbitrary acts.Mexico believes that interference in the internal affairs of other States is never admissible. In our judgment the principle of non-intervention admits of no exception. Therefore we reiterate our support for a negotiated settlement that will permit the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan.By definition  the practice of politics is the human activity leading to the establishment of a just order of peaceful coexistence among individuals  groups and peoples. In essence  it is an expression of man's free spirit that tends to of conduct that will help to channel scattered activities into a common effort. Thus it is a creative act of culture that postulates values  specifies means  sets goals and transforms anarchy into the higher unity of social organization.Politics embodies the tension between stability and change. In it are combined the values of order and aspirations to freedom  well-being and progress common to all mankind. A synthesis of collective ideals  political activity builds institutions that transcend individuals and reconcile the demand for stability with the need for change. Therefore political organization is at once the reflection and the hope of the cultural traditions of the community.Throughout history the coexistence of peoples and nations has been marked by violence  confusion and anarchy  until 1945 the international order expressed the free play of political and military forces  which for brief periods achieved states of balance within an unstable array of countries dominated by a few hegemonic Powers. Hence the fact that war has been the privileged and traditional instrument of politics between states  the perfect synonym of power politics.The savagery and horror of the second world conflagration of the twentieth century revealed the devastating consequences of power politics. This led at the time to the attempt to found a system of coexistence based on the rule of law and equality. In the post-war system the United Nations would become both the keystone and the ultimate guarantee of a new international order governed by the supreme values of peace and development.The hopes of that time have been only partly fulfilled. What has turned out to be decisive is that for the first time in history  because of today's military technology  the use of force can no longer be an effective means of political action. In the nuclear era an imperial order of domination and subordination is no longer possible. For the community of nations there is no alternative   diplomacy and negotiation. This is not only an ethical mandate but also  and fundamentally  a logical demand and an imperative of reality. That is why I have said that the principles of the United Nations are more relevant today than ever before.Intelligence demands inexorably that the United Nations be strengthened  otherwise we may not survive. It is my fervent hope that on this fortieth anniversary of our Organization all Member States will heed the voice of justice and law  of understanding and reason  and that we will work together with renewed vigor for peace and for the development of all the world's peoples."
"79",4616,"MLI",40,1985,"Forty years ago the world had hardly emerged from the mortal peril of the Second World War. The horror had been such that some States thought the time had come to give some thought to establishing a new structure for peace. Thus  in 1945 we saw the birth of the United Nations system. Based on confidence in the future  it committed the nations to raise their sights beyond their own frontiers and to join in a common endeavor of peaceful co-operation.The founders of the Organization knew that in order to prevent the outbreak of a new world conflict all nations would have to build their relations in a way which transcended their own individual visions of the world. Their idea was to bring to birth the will to act in common to attain the goals of international peace and prosperity common to all mankind.Forty years ago  the objective in founding the United Nations was to safeguard peace  to make it permanent  to make it possible for everyone to achieve prosperity. Today  this objective remains unchanged.My delegation reaffirms the attachment of the Government of Mali to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Inspired by political will at the highest level  the people of Mali and its leaders are totally committed to these principles  because they are entirely in keeping with our own ethic.The indivisibility of peace  the protection of the political independence and territorial integrity of all States regardless of their internal system  their level of economic development and their military and political power  the prohibition of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  disarmament  the sovereign equality of all States  non-interference in internal affairs  respect for the right to self-determination  decolonization  respect for human rights  the collective settlement of world problems - these constitute  according to the Charter  the bricks and mortar with which to construct the system of security of the world today.Unfortunately  we have to say that this vision of a world in which human civilization could develop in freedom and base its efforts on these freedoms has not been vindicated by history. Or. the contrary  the world is living under the nuclear umbrella of the great Powers  a prey to fear  to anxiety  to the grimmest forebodings. Indeed  while the underlying hypothesis of the Charter was the idea of justice and co-operation  so far short-term national interests have prevailed over the common weal.We are very far from universal acceptance of the principles of the Charter as immutable rules of conduct in international relations. Proof of this is the large number of armed conflicts which have taken place in the world since 1945. The developing world has been the scene of these conflicts  and in fact the victim of most of them. This conflict-ridden climate shows the ineffectiveness of the systemfor safe-guarding international peace and security provided for in the Charter.In recent years  many States  including Mali  have demonstrated growing concern at the quantitative and qualitative development of nuclear weapons and the instances of their use. It is a fundamental reality that the use of nuclear weapons constitutes by far the greatest danger to the future of the human race. It is also a fact that expenditures on these arms are swallowing up vast amounts of money. The enormous consumption of natural  technical and human resources for potentially destructive ends stands in grim contrast to the urgent need for the economic and social development to which those resources could otherwise been devoted.In spite of the efforts of the United Nations since the adoption by the General Assembly  on 12 December 1980  of resolution 35/156 A  on disarmament  results have been slight. Meanwhile  the Powers are outbidding each other in their efforts to accumulate arms.In recent years the situation of many developing countries has generally declined because of the continual decline of the world economy. The poor are getting poorer  hunger is on the increase  whole peoples are threatened with disappearance from the surface of our planet. Injustice is growing out of the ills of underdevelopment and new mortal scourges  such as drought and desertification  are assuming truly alarming proportions.At this time of stock-taking  how can our world today remain indifferent to so many life or death problems? How can the international community react to such life-threatening anomalies? How can we build a better world if world public opinion remains silent in the face of the specter of death which continues to stalk more than 800 million illiterates  more than 400 million people suffering from serious diseases  and more than 500 million chronically undernourished?That is why only recently  in this very Hall in the Headquarters of the United Nations  the Head of State of Mali  President Moussa Traore  so pertinently drew the attention of the world community  particularly the developed countries  to the tragic plight of the developing countries  especially those hardest hit  and the consequences of an intractable economic and social crisis aggravated by the scourge of drought.The plight of Africa is a tragic one and calls for a specific response from the international community.It is the responsibility of the international community to find new  original solutions to this situation. It is the responsibility of us all collectively to face up to this situation clear-sightedly and with determination  and not just to keep to the beaten track.For its part  Mali intends to take an active part in defining a new approach to problems of development and  of course  the development of international regional and local strategies. My country has committed itself unreservedly with all its human and material resources to this gigantic struggle.There is no need to remind the General Assembly  following the recent meetings o£ the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  of the efforts undertaken by the people and Government of Mali to think again about the very concepts of desertification and drought and to come to terms with these problems and their consequences.On the national level  a whole strategy has been evolved on the basis of the experiences of the people of Mali and the fundamental idea that the most useful assistance is that which comes from the people themselves. This commendable option in no way excludes outside aid  which is considered as one of a number of inputs. It is from this sound and realistic standpoint that we call upon our partners in development.Drought is not the only misfortune of the African continent. The crisis also results from the unfavorable international economic situation  marked as always by the disproportion between aid to development and armament expenditures  the continuing decline of the volume of development assistance  the intolerable weight of debt servicing  the continuing fall in primary commodity prices and the decline in the terms of trade  and the retreat from multilateralism.However  it is appropriate here to express our satisfaction at the effective assistance from friendly countries  international organs and non-governmental organizations  to which my delegation wishes once again to express the profound gratitude of all the people of Mali. My delegation has already expressed its pleasure at the idea that the second International Conference on fund-raising for economic rehabilitation and development  to be held next December in Bamako  will bring even more partners in development together.Similarly  my Government hopes that all the development instruments within the United Nations system  in particular the irreplaceable emergency offices  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the UNDP  will have more resources available to them at the forthcoming replenishment of the indicative planning figure.We cannot build a better world if the world economy is still suffering from the selfishness of the affluent  if the developed peoples cannot muster enough political will to grasp the realities of the catastrophe  to do something about it and to build a new economic and social balance in today's world.These requirements must form part of any reasonable machinery for our collective survival in terms of human civilization. That is why  at the thirty-fourth session  my delegation stated that peace consists also  and perhaps mainly  of economic and social justice. Everyone is quite aware that peace is largely dependent on the solutions we shall together find for the serious imbalances in the world economy.Poverty is not only a scandal that the peoples of the third world display to the affluent tourists; it is also a danger to the very equilibrium of the planet. As we confront this situation  which is almost indescribable  it is no longer enough simply to indicate one's good intentions in order to have an easy conscience.Without any doubt  man  together with all his achievements  will perish from the earth if he fails to understand in time the requirements of interdependence for collective survival.The first requirement remains the improvement of the world economy. The delegation of Mali is more than ever convinced that dialog and consultation are decisive elements for the establishment without delay of the New International Economic Order. The establishment of that new order will require political determination to bring about a world without hunger  without fear  a world with greater freedom in which man will be reconciled with his own history. Without such political determination the problems we must continue to face together will remain in all their terrifying dimensions.The year 1985 is significant also for another anniversary  just as famous and historic. This is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is only natural to link the two celebrations.Clearly the relinquishing of all forms of political and economic domination still remains only an ideal. Nevertheless we can with some legitimate pride celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Indeed  since that Declaration of 1960 more than 100 colonial territories have regained their freedom and brought the number of Members of our Organization from 51 to 159. There can be no more eloquent testimony to the value of the United Nations system in this regard.The victorious struggle of the colonized peoples  which have confirmed their historical identity  has powerfully contributed to the inevitable withering away of the colonial system towards the end of the twentieth century  and we are entitled to be proud of this positive record in the application of the principles and purposes of our Charter.These ideals  purposes and principles are indivisible. They are the very bases of the foreign policy of my country. Mali is particularly proud of being a member of the Committee on Decolonization since it was first set up  and of having thus contributed to the restoration of the right of peoples to self-determination  a right inscribed by the struggling peoples in that historic Declaration. One of the most persistent and spectacular activities of the United Nations has been its efforts to contribute to the victory of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America  whose emergence in the international arena has constantly influenced the course and the character of history. Yet the process of decolonization unfortunately remains incomplete. Today our world is still prey to the anachronism of colonial wars and the subsequent national liberation struggles  ordeals arising from colonialist maneuver and political distortions.Thus in spite of the progress already made  it is more than the strictly political and legal concept of the dependence of peoples that remains on the agenda at the end of the twentieth century.My delegation would therefore like vigorously to reaffirm that no people should have its aspirations to self-determination and independence thwarted; no administering Power can be exempt from respect for the United Nations Charter in this matter  nor can it be exempt from its juridical  political and economic obligations laid down in the Charter as internationally recognized responsibilities.Within the historic context of this anniversary  it would seem to be of the highest priority to condemn the abominable and hideous regime of apartheid that continues on the soil of Africa to trample underfoot the elementary rights of the African and to defy the international community with impunity. My delegation believes that any support for that regime must be halted immediately  to enable the majority of the population to express itself freely and to participate legally in public life in a society from which racism and the enslavement of man has been banished.My delegation also believes that without the assistance given to that regime  outlawed and condemned by all the peoples of the world  the people of Namibia would have been able to sit with the nations present here and celebrate our fortieth anniversary. Unfortunately South Africa continues with unprecedented arrogance  to murder  torture and arrest millions of Africans who aspire only to live free on the soil of their ancestors. With blind hatred it is fiercely bent on destroying its African neighbors on the most spurious pretexts.My delegation reaffirms with the utmost vigor and solemnity that the international community must impose mandatory sanctions to put an end to these relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. We welcome the idea that every day resistance to apartheid and to the illegal occupation of Namibia are gaining ground  as is the international campaign  now becoming world-wide  against the racist regime of South Africa.As was so eloquently pointed out here by His Excellency President Moussa Traore  President of the Republic of Mali:""We must fight by all possible means - diplomatic  political  economic and military - a system that is the shame of mankind  and we can no longer fail in this imperative duty.""More than ever  after the failure of the conferences in Geneva and Lusaka  Mali believes that only Security Council resolution 435 (1978) can serve as a basis for the final settlement of the Namibian question. Similarly my delegation unswervingly supports the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.My country  guided by the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and those of the Organization of African Unity  has been following with similar concern the conflicts that are rending apart our brother peoples in Chad  Western Sahara and the Horn of Africa.In Chad it is only in the absence of any outside interference that the people of that country can resolve the crisis. Mali is encouraging fraternal dialog between all citizens of Chad with a view to bringing about real national reconciliation  which is the only solution  the only means of bringing peace to that fraternal country.Such a dialog  fruitful because it is fraternal  is also necessary to find a final  reasonable and acceptable solution to the question of Western Sahara.At the nineteenth meeting of the Organization of African unity  the Heads of State  in resolution 104  indicated ways and means of resolving this distressing crisis.While we are happy to note that the parties concerned have all accepted the principle of a referendum on self-determination  that remarkable fact should be supported by a true reconciliation of hearts and Binds.It is this task which the leaders of Mali  as well as all the friends of the peoples concerned  have undertaken with such patience  determination and consistency.Outside Africa  Mali turns towards two of its brothers in Asia  Iraq and Iran  and urgently appeals to them to halt this insensate fratricidal war  which is contrary to the teachings of Islam  to the rules of international law and to the interests of our peoples. The lessons of history  the wisdom of nations and mere common sense demand a peaceful settlement to a conflict that is tarnishing the image of the third world  the non-aligned countries and the Islamic countries.Peace has not yet returned to South-East Asia  in spite of the sacrifices and indescribable sufferings. In Kampuchea  too  fratricidal conflict has opened the way to outside interference  which the age-old genius of these peoples has always managed to avoid. Once again my delegation appeals to all the belligerents to seek reconciliation and dialog  so that this troubled part of the world can at last be restored to the peace  tranquility and security essential to the development of its resources.Similarly  the tragedy of the Afghan people  of which requires a political solution  is still being uselessly drawn out. Peace in this country depends more than ever on a genuine political resolve to negotiate on the part of all the parties concerned.In the Korean peninsula  too  artificial barriers continue to divide a single nation  to separate it  and to prevent it from realizing its plans and its deepest hopes. These unacceptable barriers perpetuate the image of a war that is long over. It is time for the valiant people of Korea to find tranquility and unity.It is also to reconciliation and dialog that the people of Mali calls the two Cypriot communities  so that the Cypriot people can be reunited in honor and fraternity.Year after year  my delegation together with the majority of States Members of our Organization  has reiterated that the question of Palestine remains at the heart of the Middle East crisis and that its solution is not to be found in the rattling of sabers but rather In the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  in particular its right to independence and national sovereignty.We shared these thoughts with this Assembly a year ago in this very place  and at that time I said that""Despite the difficulties inherent in the protracted state of tension  Lebanon has entered a new phase of national reconciliation the success of which depends primarily on the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from that territory. Peace derives strength from movements towards peace. The glimmer of hope that has appeared in Lebanon could extend to the whole of the Middle East if the reality of Palestine prevails."" (A/39/PV.29  P. 33)The most recent events in this area confirm the correctness of this analysis  and of the conclusion drawn  which should be understood both by Israel and by its allies.Recent lessons of history teach us that no war machine can overcome the will of a people for independence. Indeed  what is happening in the Middle East and the inadmissible act of aggression committed against an independent and sovereign State Member of our Organization  Tunisia  is mere madness  and a crime against humanity. Nevertheless Mali still hopes to see a peaceful settlement of this conflict  which has such tragic dimensions.This is in fact the essential purpose of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine called for in General Assembly resolutions 38/58 C and 39/49 D.Mali is impelled to reaffirm its position on this question. There must be recognition of the national rights of every State in the area  including therecognition and guaranteeing of the exercise of the national rights of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole authentic representative; evacuation of all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem; non-interference in the internal affairs of States of the region.In Latin America the situation is still a matter for concern in spite of many initiatives on the part of the Contadora Group  whose praiseworthy efforts should be continued and supported.These are the fundamental bases for the pursuit of a true peace policy which  both in the Middle East and elsewhere  is threatened by the highly dangerous accumulation of arms and weapons of mass destruction.Previous speakers have described in sufficient detail the tension of the current international situation. The arms race which is the indelible brand of our world today continues to bring ever nearer the fatal catastrophe. For if no brake is applied in time  the accumulation of increasingly sophisticated weapons will inevitably lead to the blowing-up of our planet. It is thus the very existence of mankind that is at stake. The solution of the problem of the nuclear arms race is thus a matter of the utmost urgency and priority  because it is a condition for the very survival of mankind.It is therefore encouraging to note the resumption of dialog in the Conference on Disarmament  and above all the initiation of new talks between the super-Powers on nuclear and space armaments. These promising elements reflect a certain improvement in the field of disarmament.My delegation hopes that this new beginning will lead to the triumph of clear-sighted political will over all the various difficulties and to the triumph of reason and of the fundamental interests of mankind. We believe that while theparticular importance of this new attitude is clear to everyone  the United Nations should encourage and promote such negotiations without giving up its central role as an instrument for peace.By rising above passions  selfishness and narrow-mindedness  we can together build a better world  with hope for future generations.My delegation would like to hope for the establishment of international relations based on mutual respect and dialog among nations. We wish solemnly to reaffirm Mali's faith in the ideals of the United Nations Charter and to reiterate the determination of the people and Government of Mali to work for peace wherever it is threatened. We would recall that in order to safeguard world peace and consolidate international relations in keeping with the Charter and with active peaceful coexistence  the first step must be to reduce and eventually eliminate regional and local conflicts and ease tensions in international relations.Therefore  the delegation of Mali would venture to hope that the manifesto that will emerge from these celebrations will focus attention on the struggle of the developing peoples for elementary justice and fundamental human rights. This struggle more than any other calls for a concerted international effort to deliver the world from an imminent threat to peace  and from an iniquitous system which is a parody of justice.We have permitted ourselves these hopes because you  Sir  have been chosen to conduct our proceedings at this session  which has a special significance. Your election is a well-deserved tribute to your great country  which which my own country enjoys excellent relations. Your election represents a clear recognition of your skill  based on your long experience over the course of an exceptional career.Our hopes are also well founded because of the exceptional qualities of our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who  with his remarkable colleagues  is fully committed to the cause of humanity.It is my pleasure also to reaffirm the great satisfaction of my delegation over the remarkable way in which your predecessor. President Paul Lusaka  a son of one of the front-line states  discharged his important function of conducting the proceedings of the thirty-ninth session.And since we are celebrating an anniversary  my delegation would like to extend to the Organization its best wishes for long life and prosperity.We would recall that just as the image of the world must be recreated again and again  so the search for peace  mutual tolerance and solidarity must be continually recommenced.It is in this spirit that we must celebrate the anniversary of the great historic event of 1945 which for so many men and women meant the end of the dark night and the dawn of liberation.I shall conclude my statement by quoting the Head of State of Mali  who in expressing the faith of the people of Mali in the United Nations  declared that""The people of Mali is ready to act whenever action is taken  in the nameof the Charter  to make our world a proper place to live in""."
"80",4657,"MLT",40,1985,"Mr. President  it is a particular pleasure for me to extend to you ray congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your long and distinguished record of service for your country - a Mediterranean country - in the United Nations has been justly rewarded on the occasion of this special anniversary.Perhaps one of the most significant aspects of these fortieth anniversary celebrations concerns the evaluation of how much the United Nations has contributed to the substitution of the principle of sovereign equality and mutual respect among States for the law of the jungle which erstwhile had prevailed  culminating in the horror of two World Wars.Unfortunately  a number of misgivings must accompany this evaluation. Among the more positive factors  however  is undoubtedly the role which the world Organization has encouraged even small and island developing States to play in the conduct of international relations.Malta is one of these small States which has derived significant benefits from its participation in the United Nations. Our fledgling parliamentary democracy  striving to establish a solid internal balance between individual freedom and collective compassion in the framework of a mixed economy and pursuing in its foreign relations a status of neutrality based on the principles of non-alignment has found in the United Nations both the understanding as well as the support which have enabled it to persevere in its chosen path even in moments of difficulty and opposition.We have also found that  in spite of the constraints imposed by our limited resources  we have been able to contribute directly to the work and objectives of the United Nations.Soon after we joined the Organization  we started playing a prominent role in the law of the sea negotiations. Over the past 15 years we have served on most of the major organs of the system  namely  the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP);  the Council of the International Maritime Organization (IMO); the Economic and Social Council the Governing Body of the International Labor Organization (ILO); the Executive Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the Industrial Development Board of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  together with our current membership on the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).We have also had the privilege of serving twice as Vice-President of the United Nations General Assembly  in 1970 and again this year. Our role as Rapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People since its inception in 1975 has  we believe  provided a valuable contribution to the search for a just and lasting solution of the Middle East question. We are keen on continuing to play this role.By far our most challenging and rewarding experience in the United Nations has certainly been the opportunity we had in 1983 and in 1984 to serve a term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. This membership permitted us to project with greater clarity and purpose our wholehearted commitment to the methods of peace in the relations among States.The United Nations forum has therefore enabled us  and others like us  to underline the point that the pursuit of an independent foreign policy is as much a vital and indispensable element of sovereignty for a small State as it is for larger and mightier States. At the same time however - and this has been brought out in a recent Commonwealth study on the subject - small States face the challenge of a particular vulnerability which often exposes many of their foreign policy decisions and actions to intensive scrutiny and unjustified suspicion by larger States.Malta has had to face this reality ever since  in 1971  under a socialist administration  it started taking those policy decisions in the political  economic  social and other fields which were called for in the pursuit of its sovereignty and national development. We have had to deal not only with openly expressed disapproval but even with outright hostility in respect of such actions as the internal reforms of our health  education and social welfare systems  and our foreign policy openings towards new countries in our region and beyond. The essential objectives in pursuit of which these foreign policy actions were taken  namely our desire to transform Malta into a neutral and non-aligned State in the Mediterranean  acting as a focal point for regional peace  stability and co-operation  were deliberately misinterpreted and distorted.Fourteen years ago many eyebrows were raised when the newly elected socialist Government of Malta took the first  and most legitimate step  in assertion of an independent foreign policy by opening relations with the People's Republic of China. It took many years for this step to be recognized for what it really was: an extension of Malta's range of partners and by no means a replacement of one set of partners by another.During these years the invaluable assistance of the Chinese people to Malta  in major infrastructural projects  in the setting up of joint industrial ventures  and in technical assistance  has in itself reflected the positive and progressive nature of this partnership. At the same time China's interest in and support of Malta's efforts to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace has been of such a nature as to confirm the important contribution which such partnerships can make towards regional and international stability and co-operation.Far from justifying any initial misgivings  Malta's political opening towards China has therefore translated itself into friendship between peoples  allowing direct contact as a model partnership for mutual economic co-operation and for regional stability  which it is our objective to apply in our future relationships with other States.Malta faced a similar experience in the process of establishing relations with the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe. Deeply embedded misconceptions about the range of policy options permissible to small States for a long time swayed opinion in Western Europe that Malta's opening to the East was an outright replacement  and not simply a legitimate extension  of existing partnerships. The incongruity of not permitting a small island State to adopt the same range of options as other  and larger. States  was hardly ever acknowledged. The Western press  which a few years ago made such a fuss about the opening of a Soviet Embassy in Malta  never for a moment stopped to reflect that a United States Embassy had already been in Malta for many years and that close diplomatic co-operation with the Soviet Union was a fact of life in all Western European States.How much this was also the case for Malta can today be gaged from the mutually beneficial economic co-operation which has resulted  not without hard work  from our relations with the Soviet Union. This includes the use of ourMerchant Navy servicing facilities and the signing of a trade agreement  the cent re-piece of which  the order for the construction of eight timber carriers in Malta  is the envy of shipyards throughout our region.The same objectives which have prompted us to seek the openings with China and with the Soviet Union continue to inspire us to develop our economic co-operation with the United States of America. Malta considers that one of the best guarantees which can be given of the positive contribution which its status of neutrality makes towards Mediterranean stability lies in the genuine interest with which it pursues its economic relationships with the major Powers. We remain deeply conscious of the fact that  while each individual relationship must also be a function of the specific economic interests and potential of our respective partners  the common political element which binds them all together is the endeavor to consolidate our status of neutrality as a factor of stability in our immediate neighborhood.Perhaps most reflective of the irrational prejudice which inspires attitudes towards the action of small States are certain reactions and interpretations concerning our relations with our close neighbor Libya. An active partnership with its closest neighbors is an indispensable factor in the security and well-being of any peace-loving State  more especially so  in the case of a State which  like Malta  has placed primary importance on a policy of neutrality and openness to all.Libya has traditionally been Malta's most rewarding trading partner in the developing world. Thanks to our policy of close co-operation with Libya  this partnership has expanded into many other sectors  with resultant benefits to Malta's economic development  especially at a time of unemployment and economic disarray in many industrialized countries  which could not but have their negative effects also on us. At the same time there has been abundant evidence available to show that no side in this partnership had any illusions at any time about the maintenance of Malta's sovereignty and independence of action.This emerged most clearly in connection with the differences which arose between the two sides on the division of the continental shelf. Both sides acted energetically to safeguard what they perceived as their legitimate interests in the matter  without any assistance from any third party Malta maintained its position and eventually the matter was referred to the International Court of Justice which  earlier this year  proposed a solution which now offers a good basis for a negotiated settlement. The necessary stability and predictability are therefore now assured for interested corporations to enter into mutually beneficial arrangements with the Maltese Government for the exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources in our sea-bed.Malta's jealous guardianship of its sovereignty and independence of action  also called for  during the 1970s and early 1980s  a revision of existing relations with many traditional partners in Western Europe. Here again the entrenched prejudice against the freedom of choice available to small States distorted the perception of the nature of the measures which we were undertaking and thus retarded the achievement of the objectives which we were seeking.I have had occasion to speak in this Assembly about the various problems we faced at one time or another with many of our long-standing partners  including Britain  the European Economic Community  Italy and Japan. I am gratified to have to put on record today that many of these difficulties are now behind us and that our determined effort to establish open  fair and mutually beneficial relations with as wide a range of partners as possible is also prevailing in this regard.For some years Malta's relations with Britain were soured by the fact that our ex-colonial ruler refused to assume what we considered to be its responsibilities in clearing our waters of bombs and wrecks left there as a result of its earlier presence in Malta. This year  however  a settlement of this outstanding problem was reached. In a five-month operation between April and August personnel from the British Royal Navy worked together with Maltese divers to remove over 40 major pieces of ordnance and various wrecks from the sea-bed in our Grand Harbor in order to permit the fullest use of the grain-loading and other infrastructural facilities we have recently built there. What was a limited problem in a broad sense but a serious obstacle in terms of our economic development has  therefore  now been satisfactorily resolved  thereby opening the way for us to resume mutually beneficial relations not only with Britain itself but also with other parts of the English-speaking world.Malta's relations with Italy are largely a function of the geographical proximity of our two countries and our long historical and cultural association. While Italy was one of the first countries to recognize and express support for Malta's status of neutrality  there came a time when we considered that these formal expressions of support were not finding application in practice. A huge and mounting trade imbalance between us and Italy  to our disadvantage  could not  if unredressed  form the basis of a mutually satisfying partnership. A new basis for agreement has now been reached. Italy has as a first step taken a commitment to find ways of offering us assistance in our infrastructural development  mainly in our water supply system and our road network  and this should help in re-establishing the close ties of co-operation our two countries previously enjoyed.Indeed in this very hall only a few days ago the Italian Foreign Minister  Mr. Andreotti  acknowledged this positive development in the relationship between our two countries when stating that Italy intends ""to develop these relations with full respect for the Maltese Government's position of neutrality and non-alignment  which-Italy considers as a very positive element"" (A/40/PV.8  p. 49). We welcome this statement in the justifiable expectation that it will find an expeditious and comprehensive implementation.With the European Economic Community as a whole Malta's relations over the past 15 years have been uneven. It took years of tough negotiations for us to persuade the European Economic Community  in 1976  to revise and enlarge a restricted and lop-sided association agreement which it had foisted upon us in 1970 at a time when it was still taken for granted that Malta lay unquestioningly within Western Europe's sphere of influence.When the first Financial Protocol between Malta and the European Economic Community expired in 1983 it took another long and difficult process of negotiation to persuade the Community to come up with a new offer responding to Malta's particular situation as a small and neutral State in the Mediterranean. This has now been achieved  and the Community's recently announced financial offer lays a good foundation for discussions to proceed on the forging of a special relationship between Malta and the European Economic Community under which co-operation in trade  investment and the flow of technology will be ensured.We welcome this development also because it appears to form s. part of the European Economic Community's new commitment to adopt a more responsive attitude towards the need to establish equitable relationships with Mediterranean developing countries. At their meeting in Malta last September the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned Mediterranean countries underlined this need while stressing their determination to play their own part in developing programs of co-operation with the European Economic Community.Malta considers that there is a tremendous potential still to be explored in that direction. This includes not only the closer economic and commercial links between aligned and non-aligned countries in the Mediterranean but also the links between the European Economic Community and countries in other regions which can be encouraged through closer co-operation at the Mediterranean level.It is significant  at this point  to note the contrast between the slow manner in which industrialized countries usually respond to the needs of developing countries with the much more readily forthcoming attitude displayed by resource-endowed developing countries which are themselves in a position to provide assistance  in this context  Malta wishes to express its deep appreciation to the oil-producing countries of the Gulf  particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  for the promptness  understanding and generosity which have characterized and still characterize their relations with us.In other instances progress is only the result of slow and patient effort. This has been the case in connection with our commercial relations with Japan  where after years of deadlock a Maltese private and official delegation has just concluded a visit to Tokyo for discussions on ways and means in which the large trade imbalance we have with that country could be compensated through a program of economic and other co-operation between our two countries.Similarly  with the Vatican  following a difficult period  this year has marked a significant improvement. In April an agreement was finalized whereby the Catholic Church in Malta consented to the implementation over a period of three years of the objective of free secondary education for all. This is the prelude to the conclusion of a comprehensive concordat which will place relations between Church and State in Malta on a sound and clear footing.In this as in other instances  the prejudice that inspires attitudes towards the actions of small States has been painfully apparent. While the international press-had a lot to say  much of it a distortion of facts and involving confusion between distinct aspects of internal and foreign policies  when Church and State in Malta were not yet in agreement over the issues of free secondary education for all  little if any publicity has been given since to the fact that all difficulties have now been amicably settled. It is only through such a forum as that provided by the United Nations that we can make our voice heard in explanation of the legitimacy and success of the actions we have undertaken.I should now like to turn to another aspect of the United Nations role over the past 40 years which is of particular relevance to small States like Malta. This concerns what could be termed the habit of collective responsibility on issues of international concern which the Organization has helped to foster over the years.The pursuit of this objective has not been easy. Concurrent with the emergence of the United Nations in the second half of the 1940s there also emerged the reality of a bi-polarized world dependent upon the interests and dictates of the two super-Powers and the military alliances they established. Over the past 40 years the habits of multilateralism have  therefore  had to contend with the imperatives of super-Power hegemony. A breathing space was offered in the years of detente in the sixties and early seventies which permitted the consolidation of various multilateral processes within the United Nations itself  especially the emergence of groupings like the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement  as well as the first attempts towards regional co-operation for peace and stability.The recent resurgence of super-power competition has not succeeded in eroding the earlier developments. These still permit even a small State like Malta to take up its legitimate role in the collective responsibility for security and co-operation.It is evident that we have taken the most energetic action in this context directly in our own region of Europe and the Mediterranean. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which opened in Helsinki in 1973  provided us with an excellent opportunity to work with our neutral and non-aligned partners in Europe in the search for security and co-operation on our continent. In collaboration with the neutral and non-aligned States of Europe we have not only played an increasing role in the process of European security-building; we have also succeeded in entrenching the principle that there can be no peace and co-operation on the European mainland in the absence of peace and co-operation in the Mediterranean.We are now seeking to give this principle a concrete application  on the one hand  through an effective confidence and security-building measures regime for the Mediterranean to be agreed on in the contest of the ongoing Stockholm Conference on Disarmament in Europe and  on the other hand  Malta has also taken a leading role in galvanizing the leading non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean to formulate their own program of action for peace in their own region. The first major step in this program was the appeal launched at the Mediterranean Non-Aligned Meeting of Foreign Ministers last year  urging aligned States of the region to ensure that foreign military facilities on their territories not be permitted to be used against the interests of non-aligned States.Slowly but steadily  Malta is therefore participating in a process that will eventually lead to a fruitful partnership of actions and initiatives between the neutral and non-aligned States of Europe  on the one hand  and of the Mediterranean  on the other  in transforming their region into a zone of peace and co-operation.The General Assembly has in recent years contributed towards this process through the adoption of consensus resolutions on the Mediterranean where the objectives for Mediterranean co-operation are clearly spelled out. We hope that this Assembly will again this year act in support of our regional initiatives for peace.Problems are undoubtedly not in short supply which test and challenge the determination of States to work towards stability and co-operation in their respective regions. In the Mediterranean itself the problems of Cyprus and of the Middle East pose the most formidable challenges to our collective endeavors.Malta looks upon the problem of Cyprus with particular concern because of the bonds of friendship and sympathy which geographical proximity and various national similarities instill in our two peoples. We are conscious of the deep commitment of the united Nations Secretary-General personally to work out a solution to the problem  we offer him our fullest co-operation and support. Invariably  a resolution of the Cyprus problem must deal with three related aspects: the withdrawal of foreign troops from the island; the maintenance of its unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status; and the conclusion of arrangements which meet the security and economic concerns of both communities on the island.In the Middle East  Malta has repeatedly spelled out what it considers to be the essential issues and the methods by which they are to be resolved. We support the right of the Palestinian people under the sole leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to a homeland of their own. We call for Israel's withdrawal from all territories occupied after the June 1967 war. We plead that the process of national reconciliation in Lebanon be allowed to unfold through peaceful methods  we urge that all States in the region be permitted to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.For these objectives to be achieved we urge Israel to abandon its ill-fated dependence on the use of force and we call upon all interested parties to engage in a process of consultation and negotiation eventually culminating in a peace conference  as envisaged in General Assembly resolution 38/58 C. In this context we support the initiative launched last February by King Hussein and Chairman Arafat as providing a good basis for progress. We welcome the expressions of support which have recently emerged from various quarters in support of this initiative.We also reiterate the call for Western European States to play a more direct and energetic role in the search for a Middle East settlement. It will be recalled that the United Nations seminar on Palestine  which was held in Malta in April 1982  clearly identified the role that Western European States can and should play in the Middle East question. Action in this direction has so far been sporadic and half-hearted. The time is long overdue for more effective initiatives to be undertaken. Arab-Israeli confrontation cannot go on forever. Like the history of intra-European confrontation  now settled for 40 years  the Arab-Israeli confrontation calls for greater understanding.At this point I have to refer to last week's bombing by Israel of the Palestinian camp near Tunis. By undertaking this extremely misguided action  which Malta has already joined in unequivocally condemning  Israel has deliberately sought to do irremediable harm to the nascent peace process in the Middle East. Israel's action has also injected into the Mediterranean a new factor of tension and instability which  as we have seen over the past few days  must inevitably have very serious and dangerous repercussions.No Mediterranean State  be it a member of an armed alliance  or neutral or non-aligned  can tolerate for one single moment the assumption by another regional State of a self-imposed policing role in the region. We will forcefully resist this development and we will take all necessary measures  in consultation with our neighbors  to avoid its recurrence.Outside the Mediterranean the issues that call for urgent and effective collective action for peace are many and complex. In southern Africa the long awaited crisis brought about by the injustices of apartheid is fast approaching. The call for forceful sanctions against the white minority regime of south Africa is no longer debatable in principle;. The question is only on the precise nature of the sanctions to be undertaken and on the measures to be devised to provide assistance to those States which will bear the brunt of the effort on sanctions. Malta extends its full support to these efforts.In the war between Iran and Iraq  the tragedy and suffering coming in the wake of this lingering conflict have not yet prevailed upon the contestants to find a peaceful resolution of their differences  we can only lend support to all efforts directed towards both contestants while at the same time seeking to avoid the introduction of extraneous elements and new factors of tension into this conflict.In Afghanistan and Kampuchea the presence of foreign military forces continues to call for our strong expression of concern and condemnation. We sincerely hope that the regional initiatives for a resolution of these two problems will be given the opportunity to prevail. In Central America  as it did during its membership on the Security Council Malta continues to support the Contadora initiative as providing the only solid basis for a lasting resolution of the complex problems of the region.Each year the Maltese delegation in this Assembly regularly gives expression to its hope for the launching of a process of reunification in Korea. This year perhaps more than in previous years  we have reason to believe that the prospects for an eventual solution are encouraging. The developments which have taken place over the last months on humanitarian matters are indeed very limited  but they constitute a first step  which is always the most difficult. We urge that this first step be consolidated through other initiatives in the near future so that an irreversible cumulative process for reconciliation can be established. We are ready to offer all possible assistance in this regard.In our consideration of the successes and failures of our world Organization over the last four decades  two broad sets of issues assume particular relevance: those related to disarmament and those related to economic and social development.Disarmament has been extensively debated in these halls  unfortunately with little noticeable effect. The world is undeniably a more dangerous place today than it was 40 years ago. The United Nations has played its role over the past 40 years to ensure the avoidance of a new global conflict of catastrophic proportions.However  we feel that future generations are entitled to inherit something better than a world daily dangling over the precipice of nuclear extinction.Existing efforts towards disarmament must therefore be supplemented by new and more energetic initiatives. At the non-aligned Foreign Ministers meeting held in Luanda last month  Malta supported the idea of a contact group of non-aligned leaders to initiative a process of consultations with nuclear Powers on disarmament questions. He hope that this Assembly will endorse and lend support to this idea.An element of particular disappointment and dismay at this fortieth anniversary celebration relates to the continuing failure by the international community to bring about the much needed reform in international economic relations. Fundamental inequities and injustices prevail which today find manifestation in the intolerable debt burden of many developing countries  in chronic unemployment world wide  and in continuing poverty  malnutrition  ill-health  misery  poor education and lack of basic services among the vast majority of mankind.Those instances of collective endeavor where a sense of global partnership prevails - such as in the case of drought-stricken Africa  or earthquake-stricken Mexico - constitute only the fitful and rare instances pointing to a potential which lies essentially untapped. What is needed are more effective mechanisms to promote a genuine and permanent global partnership for development whether at regional level or the level of other groupings - for example  the Commonwealth. This partnership must be able to take account of both the structural problems of industrialized economies  where unemployment has become endemic  and the basic needs of developing societies  where the very structures for economic progress are yet to be put in place. The mechanisms governing the global flow of finance  trade and technology must therefore be such as to deal effectively and simultaneously with the ills of recession as much as with the plight of poverty.It is in this context that the United Nations system  with its global membership and its terms of reference which cover the whole spectrum of human activities  has a tremendous role to play - a role related both to the creation of awareness and to the provision of structures for effective co-operation.A renewed dedication by the United Nations to this endeavor would perhaps constitute the most appropriate manner of celebrating this fortieth anniversary."
"81",4703,"MMR",40,1985,"Allow me  first of all  Sir  to express to the delegation of Mexico the deepest sympathy of my delegation for the tragic disaster which has just befallen their country. We share the international community's deep concern over and response to this catastrophe  which has found expression in the unanimous adoption by this Assembly of a resolution calling for solidarity and support for the Government and people of Mexico  who are facing this crisis with determination and courage.This year's session of the General Assembly marks the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and  accordingly  bestows a glow of distinctive honor to the high office which Ambassador de Pinies  of Spain  holds. Permit me  on behalf of myself and the delegation of Burma  to tender him our warm and sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the Assembly. We are confident that the wealth of experience and diplomatic skill which he brings with him will  indeed  be of great value to this Assembly  which is meeting at a tine that calls for highest statesmanship to effect a constructive turning point in the history of the United Nations.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay my delegation's tribute to our outgoing President  Mr. Paul Lusaka  for his distinguished services to the Assembly during its last session  and for providing much of the inspiration for this commemorative year of our world Organization.Anniversaries are traditionally a time for reflection and resolution. The occasion which we commemorate this year symbolizes the common interest shared by all Member States of the United Nations in upholding the aspirations of mankind  as reflected in the purposes and principles of the Charter. We meet at a critical juncture in the fortieth year of the existence of our world Organization. It is common nowadays for some to belittle the performance of the United Nations and to question its relevance and credibility  and their number even includes some of its founders. And so  today what is called for is a sober  even if agonizing  reappraisal  rather than merely an occasion of imposing ceremonial activities. The United Nations surely needs strong and enlightened support if it is to weather the political and economic winds that batter and erode its structure and functions  and if it is to meet the challenges that lie ahead. In his reports of the past four years the Secretary-General has been trying to drive home to the international community a message concerning his serious anxiety about the international situation and the challenges facing the world Organization. Hence  in the words of the Secretary-General ""the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provides a further occasion not only to review the performance of the Organization over the past four decades but  above all  to encourage a re-dedication by Member States to the principles and purposes of the Charter  to promote interest in the work of the Organization and support for its efforts  and to reinvigorate international co-operation in all fields of endeavor. There can be little doubt that  if it is governed by such an approach  the observance can help further the cause of international understanding.""Burma became a Member of the United Nations a few months after its re-emergence as an independent sovereign States to apply for membership in the world Organization was the newly independent Burma's first act in the international field. Attracted by its lofty idealists  we subscribed whole-heartedly to the purposes and principles of the Charter. We looked forward to an era of peace and security  achievement and welfare  freedom and dignity  which are the goals of the United Nations for all peoples. However  the record of the past 40 years  with its conflicts  frustrations and mounting crises  has reminded the world that the United Nations is still far from achieving the ideals so nobly enshrined in the Charter.Let us look more closely at what gives the United Nations its current importance and at what constitutes its limitations. Notwithstanding its imperfections  there is nothing more illustrative of the relevance and appeal of the United Nations than the record of its expanding membership and the increasing scope of its activities. The fact that the Organization  which started with 51 Member States  has now increased its membership to 159 is indeed a measure of the acknowledgment of its prestige and its role in world affairs. The United Nations has survived and lived and thrown to prove indispensable to the contemporary world.At the same time  the numerical growth of membership in the world Organization has correspondingly increased the diversity of positions and interests and unavoidably brought with it new internal problems and sometimes even critical situations. While increasing membership imparts greater strength and advantages to the Organization  it also imposes heavier responsibilities in the sense that a greater degree of restraint and moderation and respect for and tolerance of the positions of others have become absolutely imperative. Without this  we can anticipate no breakthrough in the accumulating problems facing the Organization. There is a need  then  for an intensification of efforts  so that all nations  whatever the diversity of their vie^-s and interests  may find in the United Nations a ready forum for the solution of their mutual problems  and in the Charter a common reference on all matters which touch the welfare of mankind as a whole.The Charter  in all solemnity  assigned to the United Nations as its foremost mission ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". The task of carrying out that injunction continues to be 'he Organization's main challenge. Its effectiveness in fulfilling this role is  however  largely determined by the political and power realities of the world environment in which it operates. Unhappily  factors in the international climate have not proved conducive to helping the Organization measure up to the magnitude and nobility of its tasks. What is not readily understood is that the United Nations is not a self-operating agency and that it simply cannot take significant action without the consent and support of its Members  which provide it with financial and material resources and empower and mandate it to act. That if the overall environment in which the United Nations must operate and it means little to evaluate its performance against abstract standards and without reference to these realities. It follows therefrom that the effectiveness of the United Nations flows from the respect which its Members have for its constitutional authority. In the final analysis  the United Nations will never be more than what its Members allow it to be.The conceptual basis of the United Nations at its birth was that the Allied Powers  which were the victors in the Second world War? would remain united to maintain the future peace of the world. That assumption failed to prove true with the onset of the cold war  which beset the post-War period and extended to dominate the world political scene as East-West rivalry.Faced with this historical context  the United Nations  from its very inception  has proved unable to co-ordinate  but instead has had to deal with  different interpretations of the Charter. Legal principles have become politicized and double standards have been applied. What is seen as a breach of international norms by one side is often presented as an act of liberation and fraternal aid by the other. Seen through the prism of the different ideologies professed by the opposing blocs  every major issue has been amplified in the battle for hearts and minds. The leading role entrusted to the major Powers in 1945 has deteriorated into a system founded on the antagonistic relations of the two leading Powers and the division of the world on that basis  thereby negating both the substance and the purport of the United Nations.Thus  the present crisis of confidence confronting the Organization is the result not of shortcomings in its mechanisms but of a policy out of control. The United Nations has been unable to put an end to the confrontation between the two blocs or to halt the arms race between their leading Powers. The rivalry remains and sources of tension still exist in the world. A multitude of problems before the United Nations remain unsolved. The security of the small and medium-sized countries is by no means assured  and the danger of local wars still persists.The fundamental purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security  the promotion of which depends on the development of friendly relations and co-operation among States. The principles for this are embodied in the United Nations Charter and their faithful observance is of permanent importance for the improvement of international relations and for making the United Nations a more effective instrument of international conciliation.However  in the present-day world situation it has not been easy to live up to that ideal. Thus  in the 40 years since the signature of the Charter a limited peace affording limited security has been precariously maintained through the operation of the traditional concept of the balance of power. While the post-War version of the balance of power - or the balance of terror  as it is sometimes called - may have succeeded so far in warding off a general war  it has grievously failed to prevent limited wars  localized conflicts and other instances of force being used in a manner incompatible with the purposes of the Charter. Again  while it may afford security  however illusory  to the major Powers and those who have sought their protection through military alliances  it has grievously failed to afford assured security to all  especially the weak and the small  the non-aligned and the non-armed  whose security continues to be exposed to all kinds of threats and pressures.For such countries  the peace and security deriving from the post-War system of the balance of power lacks full meaning and full content. Of course  as members of the international community  all of us have a vital interest in preventing global armed conflict. But no less vital for us is the question of our individual security  and I submit that we should have a clear understanding in our minds as to the meaning of this.To our mind  security in its immediate sense means assured freedom from the threat or use of force against our national sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity. But in its ultimate sense security cannot but mean assured freedom frost outside interference in our internal affairs in any manner whatsoever and from the application of external pressures in any shape or form. It means for each of us the right to choose freely our own political  economic and social system and to determine our own future in accordance with the ideals that we aspire to and the values that inspire us.Relevant principles concerning the matters I have referred to are embodied in the Charter as well as in the Declaration of Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States and in the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. In our view  only universal and scrupulous respect for and observance of these principles  both in word and in deed  could ensure full security for our countries. Any violation of these principles anywhere directly or indirectly  in whatever guise or under whatever pretext  deals a grievous blow to mankind's hopes for a peaceful and just order. By the same token  whenever and wherever any Power - big  small or medium - resorts to armed force in contravention of these vital principles  the inevitable result is their serious weakening and erosion  creating conditions of far-reaching implications which are of concern to all countries.We are therefore alarmed and distressed that virtually all the focal points of crises that exist in the world today have been the outcome of the flagrant violation of these principles - be it in the Middle East  Central America  South Africa  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Namibia or Cyprus. In each of these situations  there has been employment of armed intervention by an external Power in the internal affairs of another independent sovereign State to bring about a change of the government of that State. In almost every case the problem can be resolved only on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops  non-interference in the internal affairs of these countries and the exercise by the people affected of the right to choose their own government and to determine their own future and destiny. Whether it is in the Middle East  South Asia  South-East Asia or Africa  Burma cannot accept either interference or occupation as a fait accompli. The position of the delegation of Burma on these issues has often been stated at the United Nations  based as it is on our unswerving and consistent support for respect for the principles which are stipulated in the Charter as cardinal principles to be observed in inter-State relations.May I now briefly touch upon the close relationship between disarmament and international peace and security. It is fair to say that the post-war armaments race is the product of the failure of the United Nations collective security system and the consequent reversion by nations to the old concept of the balance of power to maintain peace and to ensure security for themselves. But the armaments race itself creates greater insecurity for all  and by deepening mistrust and suspicion among the armed Powers generates its own momentum. To halt and reverse it would require  in the first place  the promotion of greater trust and confidence among nations  and the removal of their deep-seated sense of insecurity.For far too long has the world been split into two major camps  with their leading Powers still encumbered by serious differences and locked in a serious contest for supremacy. But recent developments like the resumption of arms talks and the reactivation of summit diplomacy between the world's two leading Powers will  we hope  offer some prospect of reduced tension. We hope that the impulse generated by this first step will prove productive in the entire spectrum of international relations. Even if it does not yield immediate results  the summit will be a boost to the morale of a world that has been beclouded with the ominous threat of nuclear war. We can only hope that the leading Powers will be able to rise to the occasion to match the mood and expectations they have aroused and break the deadly cycle of the arms race. Fate demands that the two leading Powers must live together and make peace  particularly at this critical threshold  before man's last frontier - outer space - is defiled and becomes sullied by lethal weapons and conflict. Nothing is more urgent than to prevent the militarization of outer space.The Assembly session this year also marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The most outstanding achievement of the United Nations is certainly in the process of decolonization. The emergence of independent States from colonial rule  under the aegis of the United Nations  has led substantially to the expansion of membership of the Organization and altered the ratio of forces within it. In spite of these tangible results  the last vestiges of the twin evils of colonialism and racialism have persistently defied solution in southern Africa. They are not problems peculiar to Africa  but Africa has witnessed them in their most acute form.The people of Namibia are still deprived of their inalienable right to freedom  independence and self-determination. South Africa defies the will of the international community by refusing to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on independence to Namibia. The delegation of Burma considers resolution 435 (1978) as the only acceptable and agreed basis for an internationally recognized settlement in Namibia. For that reason we reject the preemptive move by South Africa to establish an interim government in Namibia  a decision that runs counter to resolution 435 (1978).The history of the Republic of South Africa in racial discrimination  as expressed through its policy of apartheid  is to be deplored. The prolongation of this policy has led to the exposure of all communities - black and white - to mounting acts of violence and suppression and to needless loss of life. The mounting tide of world criticism against the policy of apartheid is already taking the direction of economic pressures  which can only be detrimental to the viability of South Africa's economy. He can only hope that the leaders of South Africa will  in counsel of wisdom  reverse the present trend and remove the ominous threat of extended conflict in the region.Tremendous economic forces are shaking the world today. He are at em acute phase of a process where the whole of human society is passing through an enormously important transformation  so rapid that nations are carried along  without even understanding the underlying factors. This is reflected in the frequency of crisis situations that we encounter in the world economy. The danger inherent in the present situation is that attempts might be made to ameliorate the world's economy ills in a limited way  to serve special ends of exclusive minority interests. Solutions resorted to in this way can only result in increasing misery and the difficulties through which the developing countries  the weakest link in the world economy  are now passing.When the United Nations was conceived in 1945  few then gave so much as a thought to the fact that the conscious aim set forth in the Preamble to the Charter ""to promote social progress and better standards of living"" would have special relevance to the developing countries  which constitute three fourths of the world's population  whose physical needs have to be met and whose hunger for human dignity has to be satisfied. The task of bridging the gap between the developed and developing countries assumed primacy in the economic and social work of the Organization in the ensuing years. While the United Nations has been able to launch a series of development decades and strategies and has adopted important documents for a more equitable system in the world economic order  the paradox of the present situation is that the plight of the developing countries has not fared better. Despite all efforts at national and international levels  disparity continues unabated.In the last 10 years or so  the international system of economic operations has not been favorable to the developing countries. International trade for the developing countries has been marked by a decline in the export of commodities and a decline in raw material prices  while their role as markets for finished products and capital is on the increase. This widening trade gap is one of the most agonizing phenomena of the world today  because it not only will impoverish the developing countries through an ever-increasing indebtedness for their imports  but will gradually have an adverse effect or their economy. Trade is indeed of prise importance for development.The problem of the over-indebtedness of developing countries has now become a principal preoccupation of the international community* High interest rates  unfavorable repayment terms and adverse trade conditions make it impossible for developing countries to earn what is needed for debt repayment. This external debt crisis is a serious element of the on-going crisis in the monetary and financial system. All this illustrates the gravity of the situation and calls for the long-overdue reform of the international monetary and financial system. As monetary affairs affect the whole atmosphere of trade and aid  it appears to us that these matters are the concern of the entire international community The establishment of a new and equitable international monetary order is also contingent upon the full participation of all those who will be affected by it. Accordingly  the delegation of Burma supports the call for the convening of a conference on international monetary and financial reform.International economic relations continue to be characterized by the lack of momentum of the so-called North-South dialog between the developed and developing countries. Developing countries are steadfast in their position of global approaches to solving economic issues. Developed countries tend to seek solutions on conservative concepts aimed at retaining the status quo. In these circumstances there has been no breakthrough and preparations for the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation and development have made no headway thus far. As a result  not one of the problems facing the world economy for the last 10 years has been ameliorated or solved. Instead  developing countries continue to be in a position of dependence on the monetary  fiscal and trade policies of developed countries. The prospect of serious resumption of dialog between the developed and developing countries remains poor without some additional political effort to generate an international climate restoring the necessary trust and understanding of the respective positions of the two groups.The fact is that the world community is still far from an ordered economic system  planned for the general good  and it seems that a long struggle lies ahead for its achievement.Developing countries are at present engaged in a determined attempt to achieve a breakthrough in self-sustaining growth. While the result will depend largely on their own efforts  it is recognized generally that the acceleration of their economic growth could be hampered or even impaired if their efforts are not supplemented or strengthened by constructive international action. Economic development also brings in its train equally complex needs for social advancement. The achievements of the United Nations are perhaps more manifest in its responsiveness to these pressing economic and social issues. Less fully appreciated are the effective services of the United Nations family of related agency  institutions and programs dealing with the economic and human problems of developing countries.In a world steeped in poverty  hunger  ignorance  disease and injustice  these specialized agencies are all engaged in vital tasks relating to human welfare  national growth  international co-operation and peace. In the forefront of these activities is the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). As a major channel for multilateral technical assistance provided through the United Nations system  UNDP has assisted developing countries in their economic and social development in conformity with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. As an agency for international action aimed at combating poverty  malnutrition and hunger  the assistance provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  in the area of food and agricultural research and production  is proving valuable to developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) is helping to protect and promote the health of all the people of the world by participating in national health programs.Adopting an integrated approach to the problems of children all over the world  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) works in partnership with developing country governments to meet the basic needs of children and mothers in a variety of sectors. A noteworthy effort is the present aim of WHO and UNICEF to achieve by the year 1990 the goal of universal immunization of young children against six main diseases that kill children. This is a highly commendable vision and effort which inspires the delegation of Burma to give its keen support and commitment.It is through its family of related agencies institutions and programs that the United Nations has proved  in ample measure  that it can serves as the coordinator of man's efforts for the common wealth.It is important for all of us to realize that in the years before us the shape and substance of the international order  the question of peace and war  will be determined not only by political issues  but more and more by problems of the economy and by rapid technological development that will eventually lead to a shift of the balance of forces in the world. Economic development is regarded by all countries as the only yardstick of economic progress. But the creation of conditions of peace  at both the international and national level  is the prerequisite for economic development and progress. Peace in our time is  therefore  an urgent and immediate need. Unfortunately  the United Nations has not yet found the final answer by which man's achievements in the field of science and technology should be utilized for his betterment and not be permitted to pose a threat of his complete annihilation.As the United Nations begins the fifth decade of its life  it seems clear that the direction of its persuasion will be determined by a twofold challenge - how can it be a force for greater economic and social equality in the world as well as a force for peace?This is the task to which we must address ourselves with renewed faith and confidence."
"82",4760,"MNG",40,1985,"At the outset  I extend to Ambassador de Pinies of Spain the sincere congratulations of the Mongolian delegation on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We believe that his vast experience in the work of the United Nations will undoubtedly contribute to the success of this important session.Before proceeding further  I wish to express the profound sympathy of the Government and people of Mongolia to the Government and people of Mexico in connection with the tragedy which has befallen that .friendly nation as a result of the recent terrible earthquakes  (spoke in Russian)This year the people of the world widely commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the historic victory over Hitlerite fascism and Japanese militarism. That was a victory of the forces of peace and reason  the result of co-operation of the Powers of the anti-Hitlerite coalition of nations big and small.A decisive contribution to that victory  to the cause of liberating many peoples from the yoke of fascist and militarist forces  was made by the Soviet Union. It is with pride in our people that we declare from this rostrum that from the inception of the anti-fascist coalition the Mongolian People's Republic firmly sided with it and took a direct part in the defeat of the militarist forces of Japan.The establishment of the United Nations was one of the major results of that great victory. The main lesson of the war had determined the principal objective of the Organization: to join efforts to safeguard international peace and to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The quintessence of its activity constitutes the recognition of the right of peoples to self-determination  the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems  the renunciation of the use of force and the ensuring of collective security on the basis of trust  mutual understanding and co-operation.The purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter were affirmed and expounded in decisions of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and in the declarations of Bandung  Belgrade and Helsinki.The experience of the past 40 years has  however  shown that the actions of imperialist circles run counter to the efforts of the United Nations and are detrimental to the interests of peace and security of peoples. The policy of the cold war and atomic blackmail - which had been adopted already during the Second World War - has repeatedly threatened to undermine the very foundations of international peace.Today the same forces are subjecting mankind to the mortal danger of a new world war  a nuclear catastrophe. They are acting in disregard of the obvious fact that in this nuclear era there is no alternative to the peaceful coexistence of States on the basis of the principle of equal security for all.The bellicose militarist circles  and above all those in the United States  reckon on the use of force. They pursue a policy of confrontation with the socialist world and exercise State terrorism vis-a-vis progressive States and the forces of national and social liberation. They support and nurture revanchism  militarism and racism. The United States is bent on attaining military-strategic superiority in order to secure for itself a dominant position in the world. The policy of ensuring so-called United States vital interests brings death and suffering to millions of people in the Middle East and the Near East  Latin America  southern Africa and other regions of the world. It ruins economic life and undermines political stability in many countries. Even United States allies have to suffer commercial  financial and other losses in the name of those ""vital interests"".The arms race is being stepped up. New types of nuclear missile  chemical and other weapons are being developed. The deployment of American first-strike nuclear missile systems in some countries of Western Europe and Asia is being pushed ahead. Now an arms race in outer space is being imposed. A multi-billion-dollar ""star wars"" program and anti-satellite weapon tests are being carried out.All this increases the war threat. This is caused by the action of forces which disregard the realities of today's world  we are  however  far from being pessimistic. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic  comrade Jarabyn Batmunkh  has pointed out: ""The foreign policy of socialism is based on respect for the right of States and peoples to live in peace. Optimism and faith in human reason are its inherent characteristics.""There are forces capable of curbing the adventurist actions of adversaries of peace and the social progress of peoples. The leading role belongs to the socialist community  which has emerged and grown immeasurably stronger in the past 40 years. Ever more tangible becomes the contribution of the young  independent States  as represented by the Non-Aligned Movement  to the struggle for peace and disarmament and against war. This is evidenced anew by the results of the Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Luanda in September this year. Neutral and other peace-loving States play a positive role. The anti-war and anti-nuclear mass movement has become an important factor in the struggle for peace.The countries of the socialist community are taking active steps to avert the threat of war. Their efforts are aimed at maintaining military and strategic parity at a constantly decreasing level of armaments  achieving real measures of disarmament and strengthening the material  political and legal foundations.of detente and peaceful co-operation.The Soviet Union has undertaken concrete  practical steps. It has put forward at the Geneva negotiations a new proposal for a radical cut in the strategic armaments of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  unilaterally suspended the deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe and declared a moratorium on all nuclear explosions until 1 January 1986  to be extended further if the United States does likewise. It has also declared a moratorium on the stationing of anti-satellite weapons in outer space as long as the United States and other countries refrain from doing so. At this session of the General Assembly  the Soviet Government has advanced the concept of ""star peace"". The aims and principles of the use of achievements of space science and technology for the benefit of mankind are set forth in a memorandum on the question of ""International co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space under conditions of its non-militarization"" submitted for consideration at this session.All this creates a solid material prerequisite for ensuring success in the Geneva negotiations on nuclear and space weapons and at the forthcoming meeting between the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Sergeivich Gorbachev  and President Ronald Reagan of the United States  in November this year.The Mongolian People's Republic  like other countries  attaches great importance to that summit meeting and hopes that it will lead to positive steps towards curbing the arms race and easing international tension. We share the view that the United States of America should adopt a responsible and positive approach towards the constructive steps of the Soviet Union.The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers it exceptionally important for reducing the danger of a nuclear catastrophe that all nuclear Powers undertake an obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  following the example of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The United Nations could play an important role in this regard. In particular  the Security Council could address itself to the question of elaborating a document acceptable to all the nuclear Powers envisaging such an obligation. The Security Council would be acting in conformity with United Nations General Assembly resolution 2935 (XXVII)   in which the Assembly  having solemnly declared in the name- of Member State renunciation of the use or threat of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  recommended that the Security Council should take  as soon as possible  appropriate measures for the full implementation of these provisions.The document we have in mind  along with the solemn obligation by nuclear Powers not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  could reflect certain key provisions of the Soviet-American Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War  of 22 June 1973  in particular the obligation of nuclear Powers to refrain from anyactions which might increase the danger of the outbreak of a nuclear conflict  to take the necessary measures to lessen the threat of nuclear war  and on reducing and completely eliminating nuclear weapons.The strengthening of the nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime acquires greater importance than ever before. First of all  it is imperative to give an impetus to title work of the Conference on Disarmament on the elaboration of an international instrument on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests with a view to closing the channels of the so-called vertical proliferation of nuclear weapon.In this connection my delegation once again expresses its support for the Delhi Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of six countries  which specifically emphasizes the need to cease nuclear-weapon tests and limit and eventually eliminate nuclear armaments. Its assessment of the results of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is positive and it supports its final Declaration. The accession to this Treaty by France  China and other States  especially the so-called near-nuclear States  would help significantly in strengthening the non-proliferation regime.The creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the world constitutes an important means of preventing the territorial spread of nuclear weapons and reducing the danger of nuclear conflict. In this connection my delegation expresses anew its support of the proposals on the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Balkans and in northern and central Europe. It welcomes the decision of member State of the South Pacific Forum to declare that region a nuclear-free zone.The United States build-up of an arsenal of another type of weapon of mass destruction  the chemical weapon  causes grave concern among world public opinion. Production of its most dangerous type  the binary weapon  is under way. Plans are being made to deploy chemical weapons in Europe and elsewhere. In this connection  Mongolia fully supports the proposal made by the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the establishment of a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Our delegation considers most timely the idea of reaching an international agreement on the non-proliferation of chemical weapons advanced the other day by comrade Mikhail Gorbachev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.In connection with the increase in the chemical weapon arsenal  the General Assembly could address an appeal to States which have not yet done so to accede to the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating  Poisonous or Other Gases  and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare.Along with the accumulation of stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction  the world is witnessing an increased build-up of so-called conventional weapons on the basis of the long-term program of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The sophistication of these weapons has reached such a stage that the distinction between their destructive power and that of weapons of mass destruction becomes increasingly blurred. The present session of the General Assembly should stress the need to comply with the provisions of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.The General Assembly should similarly express itself in favour of the elaboration of an international agreement on the prohibition of the production and use of new categories of conventional weapons with exceptionally destructive effects.Peace  disarmament and development are closely interrelated. Equitable trade and economic co-operation are the material basis of peace and international stability. It was precisely such co-operation that was advocated by the 1984 economic summit of the countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).The policy of diktat  blockade  discrimination and protectionism in international economic relations not only breeds crisis phenomena in the world economy but also exacerbates international tension. The deterioration of the economic situation and the excessive growth of the external debts of developing countries are caused mainly by such practices by economic and financial colonialism and the ruinous consequences of the monetary and financial crisis of the capitalist economic system.We welcome the initiative of the Republic of Cuba which helps to concentrate the attention of the world community on these problems  which cause immense difficulties to the developing countries. We in Mongolia have welcomed with deep sympathy the decisions of the 21st Assembly of the Heads of State or Government of the States members of the Organization of African Unity and the Pan-African Conference on Security  Disarmament and Development  held in August this year.Implementation of the proposal of the Polish People's Republic on the creation of an international debt and development research center under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations would provide an impetus to the activities of the United Nations on this vital problem.Turning to regional problems  my delegation wishes  first of all  to address itself to Asia. The situation in many parts of the continent has become increasingly tense. The United States is intensifying its efforts to realize its military and strategic plans in regard to this vast region. It encourages the revival of militarism in Japan in every way  drawing that country into its adventurist schemes against the forces of peace and socialism on the continent and throughout the world.Steps are being taken to create a military and political grouping in the Far East and the Pacific with the participation of Japan  South Korea and a number of other States of the region. The deployment of first-strike nuclear-missile weapons in different parts of the continent and surrounding seas and oceans is well under way.Imperialist and hegemonist forces continue their hostile intrigues against the countries of Indochina. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea firmly rebuff such intrigues. At the same time  they pursue a flexible and realistic policy in the international arena. The Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports theirtireless efforts aimed at establishing normal relations with the other States of South-East Asia and turning the region into a zone of peace  stability  good-neighborliness and co-operation. It welcomes all steps leading to dialog between the countries of IndoChina and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).In the light of the prevailing situation in Asia  the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of American troops and armaments from the south of Korea  the adoption of a declaration on non-aggression between north and south and turning the peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free zone  become even more topical. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the initiatives and efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at the reunification of the country on a democratic basis in peaceful conditions.The situation around Afghanistan should be normalized without delay on the basis of the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The immediate cessation of the undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  waged by the forces of imperialism and hegemonism through their accomplices  constitutes the basis for the normalization of the situation.American-Israeli ""strategic co-operation"" inflicts serious damage on a Middle East settlement in the genuine interest of the Arab peoples. The recent criminal air raid on Tunisian territory demonstrated once again that the reckless actions of the ruling circles of Israel are fraught with the danger of spreading the conflict to other areas. The United Nations should take active steps for the convening of an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  in order to bring about a just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem which fully ensure the right of the Palestinian people to independence and the elimination of all the consequences of Israeli aggression. The Mongolian People's Republic once again expresses its support for the preservation and strengthening of the national unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon.We call upon the Governments of Iran and Iraq to respond positively to the international efforts to end the hostilities between the two countries and to proceed to a peaceful settlement of questions in dispute. The well-being of the peoples of both countries and the cause of the peace and tranquility of the continent require such a solution.Strengthening the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus is in the interests not only of the people of that country but of the peace and security of the countries of three continents - Asia  Europe and Africa. We lend our support to the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  aimed at bringing about a peaceful and just settlement of the Cyprus question  in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.Practical implementation of the 1971 UnitceJ Nations Declaration on the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and the earliest convening of an international conference on this question acquire ever more urgency.The Mongolian People's Republic considers that good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China constitute a most important factor in strengthening the cause of peace in Asia and beyond. My Government therefore follows with keen interest the consultations on the normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations.The socialist and non-aligned States of Asia exert efforts to strengthen peace and co-operation on the continent and put forward concrete initiatives and proposals. The implementation  for example  of the Soviet proposal on the adoption of confidence-building measures in the Far East and on carrying out step-by-step measures in the joint search for constructive solutions to the problems of security in Asia would contribute to the establishment of a lasting peace on the continent.The Declaration on the promotion of world peace and co-operation  adopted by the 1955 Conference of Asian and African nations held at Bandung  Indonesia  becomes increasingly topical. The spirit of this Declaration was reaffirmed at the widely representative meeting held this year on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of that Conference. The Mongolian People's Republic has fully supported the declaration adopted at that commemorative meeting.It may be said that our proposal on the conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific not only is in keeping with the principles of the Bandung Conference but is directed to their practical implementation in the conditions of the region.The Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the premise that collective security in Asia can be ensured only through the common efforts and political will of all the States of the region. Consideration at a broad and representative Asian forum of all the proposals put forward by the countries of the region concerning the question of peace and co-operation on the continent would constitute a useful step towards achieving that objective.As to other regions of the world  the dangerous aggravation of tension in Central America causes deep concern among world public opinion. The United States Administration intensifies its interference in the affairs of the countries in that region and steps up its policy of blackmail and intimidation towards Nicaragua with the aim of suppressing the Sandinist revolution.The Mongolian people and its Government strongly condemn this policy of naked State terrorism and express their full support for the struggle of the friendly Nicaraguan people in defending its inalienable right to free  democratic and independent development. They support the efforts of the Contadora Group and a number of other States of Latin America  directed at achieving a peaceful settlement in Central America.This year the international community commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. By its efforts to ensure the implementation of this Declaration the United Nations has made a major contribution to furthering the decolonization process and to the cause of liquidating the colonial system of imperialism.Colonialism  however  is not yet completely eliminated from the face of the earth. Namibia is a vivid example of this. The alliance of the forces of imperialism  racism and Zionism blocks the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and resorts to different kinds of maneuver and intrigues.The Mongolian People's Republic opposes the attempts to perpetuate colonial rule in Namibia. It expresses full solidarity with the Namibian people and with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  which has been leading the struggle of its people for freedom and independence for a quarter of a century.The Government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic strongly condemn the new bloody acts of repression committed by the Pretoria regime against the indigenous population of the country  which is struggling against the inhuman system of apartheid. We associate ourselves with the demands for an immediate halt to the violence and repression. Apartheid must be eliminated. My delegation demands that the Pretoria regime put an end to acts of aggression against Angola  Mozambique and other front-line States. The United Nations should take effective measures against the apartheid regime  including comprehensive mandatory sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of its Charter.The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is being widely celebrated in the Mongolian People's Republic  as elsewhere in the world. This world Organization is an irreplaceable instrument for the maintenance and strengthening of universal peace and international co-operation. The Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  whose fifteenth anniversary is being marked this year  holds a special place among the documents adopted by the United Nations with a view to achieving its main purposes. The thirty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly approved  on the basis of the initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic  the Declaration on the Right ofpeoples to Peace. This document calls upon all Governments and the international community as a whole to unite efforts for safeguarding the right of man to life and peaceful creation in the face of the common danger confronting the whole of mankind - the threat of nuclear war.The Charter of the Organization has stood the test of time and fully meets contemporary requirements. The Mongolian People's Republic rejects any attempts aimed at undermining the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations and its family of organizations. In this year of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  it reaffirms its commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter.My delegation  guided by this policy of its Government  will facilitate  to the extent of its ability  the success of the work of the present General Assembly session."
"83",4802,"MOZ",40,1985,"The People's Republic of Mozambique is deeply distressed by the loss of life  the number of afflicted persons and the enormous destruction wrought by the earthquakes which  on 19 and 20 September 1985 struck various regions of Mexico  especially its capital. At this time of sorrow and mourning  we would like to express our heartfelt solidarity and support to the Government and people of Mexico.I am addressing this Assembly on a date of profound and joyous significance for the Mozambican people. Just 21 years ago  on 25 September 1964  the Mozambique Liberation Front proclaimed general armed insurrection against colonialism. On that day the weapons of the freedom fighters opened the road that was to lead to our independence 11 years later. We recall this historic date for our people so that we may also praise the role played by the United Nations in support of the just liberation struggle of oppressed peoples.With the achievement of our hard-won independence the Mozambican nation could also realize another of its deepest aspirations - that of joining the community of sovereign nations of the world and participating in the search for understanding  co-operation and harmonious relations between peoples and States.Ten years have passed since our independence. We are justifiably proud to say that during this period the People's Republic of Mozambique has been able to establish and consolidate relations with almost all countries and increase its active participation in the united Nations system. In greeting the delegations attending this fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly  we hail the spirit that guides the international community's most universal forum: the common effort to solve the problems that humanity still faces.On behalf of the People's Republic of Mozambique  I congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. To preside over the supreme body of our Organization in a period characterized by heightened tension and conflicts in various parts of the world is a heavy responsibility. We are confident that with your long diplomatic experience and guided by the principles of our Organization you will successfully preside over the deliberations of this historic session.We salute your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the role he played in wisely guiding the work of the thirty-ninth session. During his mandate he faithfully interpreted the peoples' aspirations to freedom  independence  peace and progress.We should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the united Nations Secretary-General  on his determination and dedication in the implementation of the principles and aims of our Charter.Forty years ago mankind was emerging  deeply wounded  from the most widespread and brutal conflagration in its history.The United Nations was born out of the realization shared by all mankind that it was operative to prevent war fever from dominating our planet  a fever that could claim millions of lives  destroy human achievements  and drown in blood the dreams of our children and the hopes of our youth. THis was and remains the central task of the United Nations. Peace  however  is not merely the absence of war. It is primarily the absence of the causes of war. In this respect our Organization has played a fundamental role throughout its 40 years of life.Forty years ago  when the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco  the Organization comprised a mere 51 countries. Today the United Nations family has grown  admitting more Members and its functions becoming more varied and complex. Today the United Nations is of a universal character. This universality reflects the correctness of the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter  and the universal values it contains. Our Organization has thus been turned into a favorite instrument of all peoples for achieving their deepest aspirations to freedom  independence  peace and progress. It has been transformed into a basic weapon against oppression  humiliation and exploitation and for the establishment of more just and equitable relations among nations. The United Nations has spread the ideals of brotherhood  equality and solidarity among peoples and nations.The adoption of resolution 1514 (XV) on 14 December 1960  recognizing the right of peoples and countries under colonial domination to self-determination and independence  was a landmark in the life of our Organization. It was the culmination of the international community's awareness that as long as exploitation and domination of countries and peoples persisted  war would continue to devastate our planet. From then on United Nations activities in favor of decolonization and emancipation of peoples experienced an exponential growth.Despite humankind's efforts  despite the fact that peace constitutes a fundamental aspiration for people the world over  the scourge of war has not yet disappeared. Its causes are still there. Colonialism has not yet been completely eradicated from the face of the earth. There are still situations where peoples are deprived of their country  sovereignty and freedom. Underdevelopment  wretchedness and hunger still ravage a great part of our planet. The economic domination of nations has not been eliminated. The gap separating developed and underdeveloped countries has continued to widen.International peace and security  peaceful settlement of disputes  rejection of the use of force in international relations and good neighbourliness are fundamental principles  the very cornerstones of our Organization. Nevertheless we are today witnessing a serious worsening of international relations. Frequent violations of the principles and objectives of our Charter are today manifest. We are witnessing an increasing recourse to the threat or use of force and to intervention or interference in the internal affairs of'other States. Conflicts between States have worsened and are taking on increasingly dangerous dimensions. The human and material losses incurred since the Second World War are countless. Currently  not a day passes without war claiming more lives.In direct contradiction of the requirements of our Charter  forces are emerging in opposition to the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and independence  and thus blocking their emancipation. There are numerous glaring examples of violation of the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity and the legitimate right to develop. Destabilization  direct aggression  economic blockade and the use of mercenaries  armed bandits and terrorism have become common occurrences. The spirit of understanding and co-operation among nations which a decade ago was the main trend in international relations  has been replaced by the language of confrontation and cold war.As a result  international issues are not seen in the framework of the Chatter  in the spirit of San Francisco  but rather through the prism of East-West conflict  thus distorting their true nature. Fascist and dictatorial regimes  regimes which make discrimination and racism the foundation and philosophy of theirpolicy  survive on our planet  violating with impunity the rights of human beings and of peoples.We cannot forget that the Nazi fascist and racist ideology was responsible for the conflagration of the Second World War. it committed massacres and cold bloodedly organized genocide. We cannot ignore the fact that there are heirs to the Nazi creed who pursue racist policies"" and who do not hesitate to carry out massacres in their own countries and launch aggression and wage war against other countries.To free the planet of regimes whose policies and practices are directly inspired by Nazi ideology is a basic necessity of the struggle for peace  and a task that should bring together all the efforts of our Organization  In the past 25 years the political face of southern Africa has changed radically. Our peoples have carried out a vast process of national liberation and social change that has eliminated foreign domination from roost parts of the region and brought down the rebel minority regime of Southern Rhodesia. In little more than two decades  our people  conscious of their role as the principal factor in the historical process of social transformation  and with the support of peace and freedom-loving forces  have wrenched the initiative from the colonial Powers and moved to a qualitatively new phase that has brought independence and regional co-operation.It is tills process that is now reaching its logical conclusion in the struggle of the Namibian people against South African colonialism in Namibia  and in the struggle of the South African people against apartheid. It is the elimination of these two phenomena  causes of war and instability in our region  that will at last usher in throughout southern Africa an era of peace  tranquility and prosperity for all of its inhabitants.Apartheid in South Africa and the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa constitute the main focus of regional tension. Apartheid is a serious threat to world peace and security. That is why we say that apartheid is not only a crime against the South African and Namibian people but also a crime against the peoples of the region and against humankind at large.In South Africa  24 million blacks  Coloreds and Indians suffer oppression  repression and discrimination under a system that allows political rights and privileges only to a white minority. The 24 million suffer the supreme humiliation of being treated as aliens in their own country  the humiliation of being denied citizenship.Some 15 million blacks are confined to cheap labor reserves and compelled to till barren lands. In South Africa  the struggle for democracy  equality  peace and social justice is considered a crime.*The Pretoria regime  in order to defend and safeguard the privileges of the white minority  has launched unbridled repression against individuals  nationalists and religious bodies  trade unionists  students  teachers and even small children.Police and army bullets are daily taking the lives of innocent and defenseless people who  throughout the country  are demonstrating peacefully against apartheid  against forced removals to the bantustans  against the pass laws  against arbitrary arrests. The people are not even allowed peacefully to bury their dead.South Africa has turned into a land of massacre  a society of terror. Today's massacres  coming 25 years after Sharpeville  have demolished the theories of those who tried to see in apartheid a system susceptible of reform  a system with a self-correcting mechanism.This is one facet of the current South African scenario. But there is another facet that brings a message of hope. He say hope  because the principal initiative for social change is already in the hands of the South African people  the African National Congress (ANC)  and other democratic forces.We say hope  because in the daily struggle against the apartheid system the South African people are already building the new South African nation. South Africans of all colors and races  of all ethnic origins and religious beliefs are engaged in this struggle.Even within the white community  there are those who strongly believe that only an end to the system of apartheid can bring peace and progress. Today  thousands of young whites are rejecting the racist ideology of their parents.It is an intensive struggle that takes on new dimensions day after day. It is a struggle in which an entire people show that they have no fear of the regime's repressive machinery. The heroic South African people are facing with their bare hands the army and the police armed with the deadliest of weapons. Over the past year the South African people have thus brought about a new situation: the apartheid regime has lost the little initiative that it may have had in the past and is resorting to increased repression of its opponents.Ruthless repression is today the sole initiative of the South African Government. The so-called reforms by the regime are no more than a belated attempt to wrest from the people the initiative for political and social change in the country.Each massacre strengthens the people's hatred of apartheid  each new pledge of relaxation of the racist laws which do not address the most fundamental issue - the dismantling of the apartheid system - is nothing but a ploy to gain time to divide its adversaries and maintain the structures of apartheid as they are.The only solution to the serious situation in South Africa is therefore the beginning of a process of negotiations between the Government and the legitimate representatives of the South African people  taking as a starting point the release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners with a view to abolishing apartheid. Any attempt to stage a dialog with individuals who are not representative of the people will merely prolong South Africa's present agony.It is therefore the duty of the entire international community to work with determination  on the basis of these conditions  in order to put an end to apartheid.We appeal in particular to the Western countries to use all their influence and to bring pressure to bear on the South African Government to accept this process of negotiation without any delay or equivocation.This year  when we are commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we cannot fail to mention the plight of Namibia.Namibia is the last vestige of colonialism in southern Africa. Namibia was a German colony at the beginning of this century. If we look at the map of Africa today  we find that all the other German colonies have won their political emancipation. The independent countries they gave birth to are represented in this hall.The Namibian people  however  continue to be subject to colonial domination  illegal foreign occupation and ruthless exploitation of their wealth and natural resources.South Africa is the cause of this situation. South Africa has been frustrating the efforts of the international community to bring about Namibia's independence  in the long process of negotiations to liberate this Territory under United Nations mandate  we have repeatedly been faced with South African intransigence. Pretoria persists in defying and flouting the purposes and principles of our Charter and the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly.This challenge attained its maximum expression with the introduction of so-called linkage. This deplorable concept is as baseless as it is offensive to the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence. Long before Cuban troops arrived in Angola  the United Nations General Assembly had taken the decision  in October 1966  to end the South African mandate over the Territory.Cuban forces are in Angola by the sovereign decision of that Member State of the United Nations  under Article 51 of the Charter  in contrast with the manifest illegality of the South African occupation of the international Territory of Namibia.It should be recalled that when resolution 435 (1978) was adopted by the United Nations Security Council; Cuban troops were already in Angola. They did not constitute then - nor do they now - a threat to the security of any State in southern Africa. On the contrary  it is South Africa's troops that attack  invade and occupy countries of southern Africa. Cuban troops are in Angola because South Africa invaded Angola even before its independence.For those reasons  it is both absurd and irrelevant to invoke ""linkage"" to delay the decolonization of Namibia. ""Linkage"" must be rejected. It is nothing but a thinly veiled disguise intended to protect the political  economic and strategic interests of South Africa and some Western countries  to the detriment of a sacred right we all prize and defend.It is our duty to give firm support to the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole and legitimate representative. We must provide SWA20 with all the means necessary for it to emerge victorious in its struggle for a free  independent and united Namibia. This Assembly must categorically reject and condemn the delaying tactics aimed at perpetuating South Africa's illegal occupation and domination of Namibia. Our Organization must repudiate and condemn the so-called interim government set up in Namibia.Apartheid  like nazism  is not limited to internal oppression and discrimination. It also seeks to export its conflicts abroad through destabilization and aggression. Every country in southern Africa suffers the effects of Pretoria's belligerency and hegemonic ambitions. All of them suffer the effects of interference  war and subversion  orchestrated by the Pretoria regime to impose its own interests. The Pretoria regime has used armed banditry as its operational weapon to massacre defenseless civilians  to destroy economic and social infrastructures in our countries and to stifle the process of national reconstruction and development. Our efforts for regional economic development and co-operation  as expressed in the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination Conference  have met an ineducable enemy in the Pretoria regime. Pretoria has resorted to systematic and constant sabotage of our regional organization with the aim of imposing its own designs  as reflected in the so-called theory of the constellation of States. The Pretoria regime is acting against our political and economic independence. The Pretoria regime wages constant war against the example of the free and just societies that we represent. That is the reason why even today we encounter war situations that are tearing the southern region of Africa apart.In the case of Mozambique it is a war waged against us through armed bandits. The targets for the armed bandits are the people  their homes  their possessions  the fruit of their labor. Armed banditry indiscriminately tortures   mutilates  kidnaps men and women  old and young. Armed banditry destroys schools  hospitals  health posts  nurseries  churches  community centers and shops. It attacks public and private transport and slaughters innocent passengers. It destroys economic and transport infrastructures with the aim of disorganizing and paralyzing our economy  preventing development and keeping our country in backwardness. Its actions have as their sole aim the sowing of terror  instability and insecurity. It is the most barbaric and inhuman kind of terrorism.In Mozambique  despite the non-aggression accord signed in March 1984  irrefutable evidence of grave and systematic violations of the accord by South Africa and of its continued involvement in recruiting  training  organizing  financing and equipping  and in providing leadership and logistic support to  the armed bandits  has recently been brought to light  following the destruction of the terrorist camps by Mozambican armed forces. Confronted with such evidence  the South African Government has publicly admitted its continued involvement in the destabilization of our country. It has thus become more them clear that South Africa is not fulfilling the Nkomati Accord.The behavior of South Africa with regard to Angola is not different from its behavior in other parts of southern Africa. Indeed  at the very moment when we are addressing this Assembly  the sister Republic of Angola is the victim of barbaric and criminal invasion. Occurring 18 months after the Lusaka Understanding  this invasion  as well as the failed sabotage attempt at the Malongo oil installations  unveil the criminal and aggressive policy of the apartheid regime.The People's Republic of Mozambique salutes the people of Angola for the firm and solid manner with which it has been able to frustrate the South African attacks and defend its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.The international community must condemn the acts of war that South Africa constantly commits against the States of southern Africa. In southern Africa  children  women and men of all ages are dying every day as a result of Pretoria's aggression  it is essential to end this state of affairs. That will be possible only if we all pool our strength for the total and definitive elimination of the apartheid system. Apartheid is the seed of instability and violence in our region. The regime has already shown itself to be an enemy of peace within and beyond its frontiers. All possible material and financial assistance should therefore be given to the countries of the region to strengthen their defensive capabilities and to carry out their economic development projects.It is incumbent upon this Organization to reject the attempt by South Africa and its allies to portray the armed bandits as a political opposition in our countries. To accept these maneuvers means  in the final analysis  to connive with the destabilization policy of the racist regime and to give it moral support in its acts of aggression against our countries and peoples.The role of the United Nations on behalf of the total liberation of peoples is not limited to the political sphere; it extends also to the economic sphere. We have been following with appreciation our Organization's positive role in the economic and social development of each of our countries  through the specialized agencies  bodies and institutions that make up the United Nations family. In this context we congratulate our Organization and its Secretary-General on theircommitment to the pursuit of solutions to the critical economic difficulties Africa is going through.That commitment has been complemented by the individual and joint action of African countries  which are doing all they can to find the right and appropriate programs to resolve the difficulties affecting them.The world is in a serious economic situation. The continent of Africa  however  is facing a particularly acute crisis  as the united Nations has rightly noted.The serious economic situation faced by many countries of our continent has multiple causes  and we must deal primarily with then  over and above the emergency programs needed to save lives threatened by the scourge of famine. Our economies are weak  despite the fact that our continent has much potential. The colonial legacy  manifested in illiteracy  weak development of productive forces and lack of economic infrastructures  denying us the full benefit of existing resources  continues to be deeply felt.In recent years the economic situation of our continent has become particularly critical as a result of persistent drought and other natural disasters  such as cyclones and floods. Famine has already taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and threatens millions of Africans.External factors are the principal causes of that situation. Among them  one must stress the worsening of the terms of trade  and the consequent fall in export earnings. The unprecedented rise in real interest rates and the dramatic increase in external debt combine with other factors to drain the meager foreign exchange reserves of the African continent.At the same time  we are affected by the profound international economic recession and are burdened with  the effects of an international economic system that is neither just nor equitable.Our country  besides suffering the impact of the problems I have just mentioned  is further faced with the effects of the economic aggression  destabilization and undeclared war waged against us by the South African regime.Our economy has been disrupted and in some areas paralyzed. The economic infrastructure  factories  bridges  roads  railways  power lines and vehicles carrying passengers  medicines  milk and other basic necessities have been destroyed  sabotaged and pillaged. The efforts that our state and the international community are making to save hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans affected by drought are criminally sabotaged.The twenty-first summit meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  convened mainly to deal with economic matters  established a priority program for the next five years aimed at creating conditions for national and collective self-sufficiency and for the economic development of our continent. The African countries showed once again their determination to overcome hunger  poverty  illiteracy and disease - in short  backwardness and underdevelopment. Our countries need above all an immediate solution to the problems that the colonial past  external debt and natural disasters have imposed.We believe that the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures in order to face the critical situation in Africa. The external debt of African countries has; been growing at an alarming rate. Exceptional measures are needed to reduce the enormous burden of debt and to promote the growth of the African economies.Although we recognize our obligations in respect of the external debt  we think that creditor and debtor countries alike can only gain through the adoption of courageous measures 'co revive our economies. Taking into account the diversity of the financial capacities of debtor countries  ways and means should be found to reschedule  on more favorable terms  part of the debt and convert the rest into grants.It was in that light that the twenty-first summit meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU called on the international community to find an urgent solution to the problem of increasing African indebtedness. It also called on the industrialized countries to make a substantial increase in the transfer of financial resourced on favorable terns  particularly as donations.In that context  high priority should be given to the launching of global negotiations on reforming the international monetary and financial system so as to ensure the establishment of a new international economic order to the benefit of all countries and peoples.It is likewise essential for the international community to act firmly and with determination against the destabilization policy pursued by South Africa  to eradicate armed banditry and to provide support for the southern African countries that suffer the consequences of direct and indirect aggression carried out by the Pretoria regime.We express our profound gratitude to the countries  the United Nations specialized agencies  and the solidarity organizations throughout the world that have contributed to the fight against hunger and disease in our country and cur continent. International solidarity unites men and women of all continents and strengthens our determination to overcome under-development and poverty.We note with concern the increase in focal points of tension and war in various regions of the world  including the African continent  which is being troubled by conflicts and war. Apart from the tragedy of southern Africa  our continent is witnessing situations causing the death and suffering of thousands of human beings.In Western Sahara there still rages the conflict that has been a cause of concern to the OAU and the world. We are in favor of negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front  in the framework of the relevant decisions of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations. It is our fervent hope that Morocco will take a constructive position so that the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic may find peace  and in peace build their future.We support the struggle of the Palestinian people to achieve its legitimate and inalienable rights  including in particular the establishment of a free and sovereign State.We demand the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Arab territories and from Lebanon  and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the latter.In the history of conflict between nations  of the domination of one people by another  the case of East Timor stands out as a dramatic and unhappy example. The voice of the Timorese people remains silenced by the weapons of Indonesian troops. In East Timor  the people's right to self-determination and independence is being sacrificed to political  economic and strategic interests. We believe that it is imperative for our voice to be raised on behalf of justice and the legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.We demand the total and complete withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor so as to allow the Timorese people  under the leadership of FBETILIW  their legitimate representative  to achieve freedom  self-determination  independence  peace and progress. He appreciate the Secretary-General's role in seeking a negotiated settlement of the problem together with the other parties involved  including Portugal  the administering Power of the Territory of East Timor.In Korea we support efforts for the peaceful reunification of that country.In Latin America we view with apprehension the destabilization of Nicaragua. We appeal for strict respect for Nicaraguan sovereignty and territorial integrity and for an end to acts of aggression against that country. In the search for a negotiated settlement of the conflict we support the efforts of the Contador group.The struggle for peace and the removal of the specter of nuclear confrontation is a high priority for all humankind. Peace is the basis for the economic and social development of our countries; it also offers hope for a prosperous and radiant future for peoples.The transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  free from nuclear weapons  through the dismantling of all military bases and the speedy implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  is an intrinsic part of this struggle. However  to the detriment of the littoral countries and the international community in general  the task of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean has been complicated owing to the stand of certain countries which consistently put obstacles in the way of holding a conference on this issue. In this context  we reaffirm our support for the holding of a United Nations conference on the Indian Ocean in order to take concrete steps towards implementing United Nations General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).The struggle for peace signifies serious and constructive commitment by all countries and peoples to the struggle for general and complete disarmament  an end to the arms race and a freeze as a step towards subsequent reduction and destruction of nuclear weapons  and a freeze in military spending.The struggle for disarmament is a struggle for peace and development. Without disarmament there can be no peace  and without peace there can be no development.We welcome the beginning of the Geneva talks between the two great Powers with the aim of reaching mutual understanding and finding solutions for ending the arms race  to the benefit of the interests of all countries.We are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations in the year proclaimed by our Organization as International Youth Year. Youth is the sap of our nations and as such the sap of our Organization. Allowing young people to play an active part in shaping the destiny of our countries is to ensure a better morrow for our peoples. It is the young who have the dynamism to develop and change the world. It is the young who nurture the bright dream of a calm tomorrow - a tomorrow without wars  a tomorrow with peace and prosperity. We therefore support our Organization's decision to proclaim 1985 as International Youth Year.In the People's Republic of Mozambique we continue to invest massively in our young people as the guarantee of our future. In the same context  we think that the individual and collective efforts of our countries are of vital importance in assuring the well-being of our children. The bulk of our human  financial and material resources should be channeled to this end.Our Government gives full support to the current efforts of the united Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to achieve universal immunization of children by the year 1990. We believe that that program will have positive results for our developing countries since it will reduce the child death-rate. In the People's Republic of Mozambique this program is being given high priority  as have past programs aimed at physical and mental health and the normal and balanced development of our children.The celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is an occasion to reflect deeply on the role of our Organization  on its universal significance  and on the need to improve its effectiveness. The United Nations has affirmed itself as an indispensable Organization in the pursuit of peace  disarmament  development  and harmony among nations.Forty years after the founding of the United Nations and more than ever before  our primary efforts are aimed at saving our planet from the scourge of war. We are confident that  inspired by these 40 years and by the new decade that appears on the horizon  we shall be able to rededicate our energies and commitment to achieving the principles and purposes of the San Francisco Charter. In this respect the celebration of the International Year of Peace in 1986 will be a positive step in the overall process of humankind's struggle for a better world.The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its readiness to co-operate with all the peoples and countries of the world  irrespective of their political  economic and social systems  in the realization of world peace and the strengthening of international security.A luta continual"
"84",4847,"MRT",40,1985,"Mr. President  on behalf of His Excellency  General Maawva Ould Sid Ahmed Tava  and on behalf of the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I address to you our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. In view of Mauritania's historical relations with your country  it gives us particular satisfaction to see you elected as President of the General Assembly in a historic year for the Organization. We are convinced that your admirable virtues as an experienced diplomat who represents his country in the United Nations  and has done so for a long period  will ensure your complete success in presiding over the deliberations of our Organization.I should also like ""co take this opportunity to express to the President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Paul Lusaka  the permanent representative of the sister Republic of Zambia  our expression of appreciation for the wise manner in which he presided over the deliberations of that session.I must also express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continuing efforts in the service of the international community  in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and its noble mission. We wish him further success in realizing the great hopes that the nations and peoples of the earth place in this Organization.Allow me first to stress my country's position  which has already been explained in the Security Council. We strongly condemn and denounce the treacherous Israeli act of aggression against our sister Tunisia. We stress the need to implement the relevant Security Council resolution  including the payment of compensation to Tunisia for the damages it has suffered and the taking of the necessary measures to prevent such actions in the future.At this session of the General Assembly we are commemorating the fortiethanniversary of the United Nations. This represents the age of wisdom  the age of maturity. We wish to take this opportunity to make a responsible evaluation of our Organization. We must undertake to eliminate all those obstacles which are preventing the realization of its principles  enshrined in the Charter in the-light of the long experience of mankind. The setting up of an Organization where nations can work side by side to achieve those principles is the embodiment of a great and praiseworthy idea. The United Nations has acted most effectively in preventing war and establishing the appropriate atmosphere to promote consultations  understanding and co-operation  as well as mutual concessions between nations and States.The specialized agencies of the United Nations  working in many different fields  have asked to improve the political  social and economic situation. Those agencies have stood most heroically at the side of peoples and States in their struggle to achieve independence and freedom  a struggle which has led to the elimination of colonialism on more than one continent and the creation of many States which  through their membership  have given new dimensions to this Organization.The accession of many small States to membership of the United Nations is a testimony of their trust and confidence in this Organization  and their membership allows those States to obtain recognition and support  to defend themselves  and to participate in the issues affecting mankind's future. Our Organization can be proud that the world's hopes are pinned to improving its effectiveness and increasing the scope of its mission. Therefore  on behalf of the Mauritanian people and its national leadership  I must congratulate the representatives of States and organizations  and the various eminent individuals who have attended this fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly  on the positive progress achieved by our Organization. We wish them all full success in their endeavors.I should like to stress again the importance that my country attaches to the United Nations because we are convinced that it is the main instrument through which we can work to eliminate the specter of war and chaos in the world and the only organ on which the small States can rely in defending ourselves and improving our development efforts. Our belief and faith in the United Nations and our appreciation of its achievements does not alter the fact that peoples and States today need freedom  peace and development more than at any other time in the past and that the international situation continues to be dangerous. There is war in more than one country and the horizons are indeed sombre in more than one continent. Many peoples continue to suffer as a result of occupation and expansionism and are deprived of their right to self-determination and life in dignity. Unemployment  hunger  disease  poverty  illiteracy and social crises are spreading throughout the world. The average per capita income in rich countries is 220 times greater than that in developing countries.The Group of 77 has undertaken international studies which stress the need to achieve more satisfactory results with regard to existing economic  monetary and trade problems among States. That group  however  has been faced by a continuing failure to respond on the part of countries of the North. We hope  however  that they will agree to the global negotiations for which we call so that the world may overcome these problems in co-operation between the South and the North. The rather sombre international situation makes it necessary for our Organization to become more dynamic and effective so that it can face those interconnected dangers.If we take as an example the unfortunate economic and social situation in Africa  we note the following: more than 150 million people suffer from malnutrition; the foreign indebtedness of that continent amounts to $US 174 billion; the balance-of-payments deficit is $US 18 billion; while some States spend their entire revenue on servicing their debt. Unemployment has reached enormous proportions and the Lagos plan  in which we had placed great hopes for the development of our continent  did not achieve its aims because of the drought  the lack of the necessary funds for investment and the deteriorating world economic and financial situation.Because of this frightening situation in our continent our States have had to devote increasing attention to economic and social problems. The most recent summit conference of the Organization of African Unity  held in Addis Ababa  considered most carefully what measures would be ""most likely"" to revive the economies of our countries. The summit conference adopted an important recommendation addressed to this session of the General Assembly calling for the convening of a special session of the Assembly to study the economic situation in Africa. We hope that this will make it possible to achieve satisfactory results in this field.I take this opportunity to register my satisfaction with the results obtained at the ""Paris Club"" meeting this year concerning foreign debt  and with the efforts made by friendly countries and the officers of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in order to allow that meeting to take place. We are pleased with the positive understanding shewn by the creditors with regard to the international economic and monetary situation of the debtor countries in general and the situation of our country in particular.The peoples of the Sahel do not lack determination. Theirs is a constant struggle for survival. The States are doing all they can to preserve life and to keep their dignity and independence. They realize that international food assistance will not solve their problems and that they must take those measureslikely to revive their economies  particularly in the rural sector  in order to achieve food security for their peoples. However  the achievement of that aim is not easy. Drought is a most destructive phenomenon which nullifies the efforts of the peoples and States of the areas concerned  particularly where economies are based essentially on agriculture and animal husbandry.The drought has killed more than 75 per cent of the animals in Mauritania and has turned the fields to deserts. Farmers have been forced to migrate to the cities and villages  which were not prepared to welcome them. This has posed many problems for the State in many fields  because it must provide food  water and energy for all within a short space of time. It must build hospitals and schools and establish transportation networks. Our country did not remain inactive and resign itself to the dangerous forces. Instead  we mobilized all our efforts to cope with the effects of the drought and desertification. We put forward a comprehensive plan for economic and financial mobilization in which we gave priority to the rural sector.We believe that success can be achieved only through the great efforts of our people to ensure that it produces the largest possible part of its own food. This has led our national leadership to adopt the slogan ""self-sufficiency"". We have undertaken a comprehensive information campaign in order to explain the dangers of drought and desertification. The people have undertaken a great campaign of voluntary work in the cities and rural areas to eliminate illiteracy and to undertake economic and social projects. In order to avoid the idleness and defeatism that food aid can create  we have started this year a program based on the principle of assistance in return for work. We have adopted a plan to help those citizens who so wish to return to the rural areas from the cities. In addition to providing free transportation and the necessary assistance to work the land  where that is possible  we are trying to encourage farmers to be patient and to exert greater efforts to increase production. We have established a special fund to assist pensioners  skilled workers returning from overseas and professionals who cannot find work within government structures.Our country attaches great importance to the young generations. We are working to mobilize their energies in the interest of national development. At present Mauritania is host to a large youth fair involving thousands of our citizens and covering activities in many fields. In line with our desire to provide health insurance for the new generations  my country will shortly be organizing national immunization day  in accordance with the aims of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).Our efforts within the country are complementary to our activities within international and regional organizations. We believe that assistance based on justice and equality between peoples and States  particularly States in the same geographic area  is not merely a social and political necessity to provide an opportunity to peoples to establish ties of friendship and closer relations  but also an essential economic requirement for laying the foundations for joint economies and facilitating trade relations. That is why our country has always promoted the creation of regional institutions; in fact  it has put forward several initiatives for the creation of such institutions. The great developmental efforts we are making in our country  together with our policy of austerity and the work we have undertaken to achieve a more rational management of public sector financing  have been successful only to a certain extent owing to the current international economic situation. In collaboration with the Secretary-General of the united Nations Mauritania has this year appealed to the fortieth session in a memorandum in which it stressed the need for Mauritania to be added to the list of least developed countries. In view of the significance of this request we hope that the Assembly will respond favorably.I am pleased to express my gratitude and appreciation to all friendly and fraternal States  organizations and individuals for the assistance they have provided us during the years of drought. Because the list is long  I shall limit myself to pointing to the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to enable our Organization to play an effective role in the extraordinary circumstances facing Africa. I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the personal efforts of Mr. Bradford Morse  Administrator of the emergency assistance relief operations in Africa  in addition to his heavy responsibilities as Administrator of the United Nations Development Program. We must also pay tribute to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAD) and to Mr. Edouard Saouma  the Director General  for the positive results achieved by the Rome meeting on drought.At a time when the international financial and economic crisis is spreading and when many people are suffering from hunger  billions of dollars are being spent on all kinds of weapons of destruction. Military industries are flourishing  despite the contradiction this poses to economic development. It is high time toput an end to such a situation by decreasing cold-war tensions between the superPowers and Stopping the spiraling arms race. An end must  also be put to the new wars that are being fostered between third-world countries. In 1984 alone  the world spent more than 3800 billion on weapons of destruction; that is more than $130 for each person on this planet. An end to armament is the way to development. That is how to promote the security of peoples and their independence  be it in the developed industrialized countries or in the developing countries. It represents the precondition for priority to be given to the creation of an interdependent international economy providing the possibility for man to secure his first and basic right - the right to life.More than one quarter of the peoples of the world continue to suffer deprivation  pain and hunger  despite the existence of the United Nations for 40 years. Many peoples continue to suffer from colonialism  exploitation  racial discrimination and expansionism. In the Middle East the Palestinian people has continued its heroic struggle for more than half a century against Israeli colonialism. Mauritania believes that the question of Palestine is the core of the struggle in the Middle East and that the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people must be taken into consideration  particularly its right to self-determination  independence and the creation of its own State  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  and that it must be encouraged to participate in all talks affecting the fate of the Palestinian people. We believe that Israel must withdraw without preconditionsfrom all the Arab occupied territories  and particularly from Holy Jerusalem.Israel did not stop at occupying Palestine. It went further and occupied the Syrian Golan Heights. It has annexed the Heights and attacked the sanctity of Iraqi territory by striking at the nuclear reactor built for peaceful purposes.Furthermore it committed aggression against Lebanon and occupied part of its territory. That brotherly country  Lebanon  has shown through its heroic struggle that its land and national unity are above any extraneous consideration.Like all nations that cherish peace and justice  Mauritania condemns the expansionist Zionist plans and stresses the need for Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan  Lebanon and all other occupied territories.In the African continent more than a century has elapsed since the holding of the Berlin Conference which produced the plan for the partition of Africa and its occupation. This is a period that has witnessed continuing struggle for freedom in order to end the enslaving of man by man. Most peoples and States of the continent have achieved their freedom and independence  following much suffering. However  the peoples of Azania and Namibia continue to languish under occupation and racial discrimination. The situation this year has reached a most critical point  unprecedented in the history of mankind. The heroic struggle of the African people for freedom  dignity and equality has reached a climax. The racist regime in South Africa  like Israel  practices bloody terrorism against entire peoples. It defies the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council and commits acts of aggression against neighboring countries.Mauritania strongly condemns the racist regime in Pretoria because it is persisting in its aggressive policies. Mauritania is convinced that  as terrorism escalates and injustice reigns  the day of freedom and equality draws nearer.The continuing occupation of Namibia has led to much pain for that country  whose people is waging a heroic struggle  under the leadership of the Smith West Africa People's Organization (SWAFO). In accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  Mauritania believes that the international community must work seriously to achieve Namibia's independence this year  when we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of our international Organization.The war between Iraq and Iran has resulted in both countries paying an astronomical price in all spheres. It has affected stability and development in the region as a whole. Despite the peaceful efforts of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other international bodies  peace is not  unfortunately  in sight  although Iraq has many times declared that it is prepared to put an end to the war. We hope that all will respond to this peace endeavor.We recall to our brothers God's teachings that peace is the only way for mankind.The war in Afghanistan is now in its sixth year. On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I feel impelled to renew the call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from this brother Moslem country. We call for the return of refugees to their homes and to their families  and for the Afghan people to be allowed to determine its own future  as it sees fit  so that the country can enjoy security and stability.As for Kampuchea  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania believes that the time has come for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the territories of Democratic Kampuchea. Its territorial integrity must be respected and there must be no intervention in its internal affairs. Its people must be given the right to choose its own political system.We renew our support for the General Assembly resolution on the subject and for the Declaration of the World Conference on Kampuchea  held in 1981.As for the Korean question  Mauritania trusts in the wisdom of the Korean people and the two States of Korea  North and South  and therefore believes that they can achieve a peaceful settlement through negotiation. My country takes note with satisfaction of the latest contacts between the two parties.The situation in Central America demands pursuit of the efforts exerted by the Contadora Group. We hope that security and stability will be re-established in this important region in the world.Turning once more to Africa  we note that the Northwest of this continent continues to suffer from tension because of the continued problem of Western Sahara. For my country  this is a most important issue. Mauritania  which enjoys fraternal relations with both parties to the dispute  hopes that comprehensive peace and stability will return to the region so that our brothers may becomeclose again  so that the joint development plans of those States  may be given a chance to succeed  and so that we may achieve the unity which has been long hoped for by the peoples of the Greater Maghreb.The generation preceding ours  by creating the United Nations  put down the cornerstone for a society of peace and co-operation between nations. What we must do is abide by those rules which govern the Organization. We must renew our commitment to its Charter. This is the only guarantee we can offer to give the Organization the authority it needs to solve *he international questions put before it. The time has come to put an end to selfishness inside the international community. It is time to start thinking and studying about how we may achieve happiness and well-being for all nations.The peoples in the South  in the North  in the East and in the West have common basic interests. They are constantly looking forward to peace  freedom and justice. We must give interdependence its true  positive meaning and its humanitarian dimensions. We must never forget that life is merely a passage to higher things. We must not forget that bodies perish and history only remembers good acts. In the end history has the last word."
"85",4893,"MUS",40,1985,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to express to you and my personal congratulations and happiness  and those of my delegation  on your assumption of this office which represents the culmination of a long and brilliant diplomatic career which began almost at the time when this Organization was born. The considerable personal experience and wisdom which you have gained at the service of the United Nations for almost a quarter of a century  in various distinguished capacities  in particular the presidency of the Security Council  will be of special value during this anniversary session  which will be a time for self-examination  renewal and invigoration.I would also like to perform another agreeable duty in thanking your predecessor  Mr. Paul John Firmino Lusaka  Permanent Representative of Zambia  for his distinguished  firm and efficient conduct of the deliberations of the General Assembly during its thirty-ninth session. He did honor not only to his country but also to the whole of Africa  and by his display of wisdom and remarkable diplomatic skills has further enhanced Africa's stature in our Organization.Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his fourth report (A/40/1) on the work of the Organization in which he has once more demonstrated his unceasing and almost obstinate determination to revitalize the United Nations and give it the role that its founding fathers had envisioned. In thanking him  we would like to assure him of our full co-operation in the discharge of his mandate.To the people of Mexico  we express our deepest sympathy for the recent tragedy which has befallen them.This year also marks the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. More than 60 per cent of the world population living today was born after that war. Many of them have grown up in a period of relative calm  free at least from the nightmare which their parents had to live through. They do not bear any responsibility for the horrors of the war and no burden of guilt can or should be laid on them. They have  in many.instances  shown a commendable desire to correct the injustices of the past and their efforts have contributed in a large measure to heal the deep wounds of the years of unbridled cruelty  violence and carnage.There are  therefore  powerful arguments for putting the past behind us and forging ahead to meet today's challenges and those which lie ahead in the future. It does not mean  however  that we should either try to wish the past away or attempt to obliterate it. This is neither possible nor desirable.Besides  as we look at developments since the end of the war we are sadly forced to admit that there are few grounds for satisfaction and that there are many grounds for apprehension. Over the years  others before me in this forum have been pointing out the dangers of the world divided against itself in which we art forced to live. The dialog necessary for continued peaceful coexistence  which has become the essential condition for our survival  seems to have been sadly lacking in understanding and generosity  not to say in sincerity. In place of the peaceful competition which we all profess to desire  the end of the war witnessed a scramble to carve up and establish spheres of influence  which has transformed the whole world into a potential battleground.It has been pointed out that a world in which overt or covert attempts are repeatedly made to destabilize or overthrow lawfully established Governments because their system is not to one's liking cannot for long remain a safe world. The history of such attempts since 1945 in violation of the provisions of the United Nations Charter has been richly documented. On the other hand  it is becoming customary to hear the argument of national security and vital national interests advanced for the practice of shoring up unpopular client regimes  as if the peace and security of any country could ever be served by the use of brutal force against the legitimate aspirations of peoples.Our predecessors who drafted the Charter of this Organization sought to establish peace on a more legitimate premise: by asking the international community to renounce the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. We are painfully aware of the many violations of this sols ran undertaking to which all the Members of this Organization have subscribed. The international community has been forced to watch from the sidelines with growing helplessness as military aggressions and invasions become more and more brazen and as defenseless countries come under hostile foreign occupation. It has been powerless in the face of the shameless and unprovoked use of force to achieve so-called national security objectives. It has remained a passive  if indignant  witness as millions of people have been converted into foreigners in their own lands  denied the basic rights of citizenship  while others were being chased out and forced into permanent exile. The international community has been given the responsibility  but denied the means to act effectively to avert the outbreak of hostilities and to check them after they have started.It is becoming commonplace to hear the argument that at least relative peace has been preserved for a period of 40 years. The argument  I am afraid  is based on ostrich-like reasoning. It does not take into account the scores of wars fought over the past 40 years and the wars which are still being fought in many parts of the world. The fact that the territories o£ some countries  former battlefields  have mercifully been spared the horrors of war can hardly justify the assertion that the world has enjoyed 40 years of uninterrupted peace. There are  no doubt  those who believe that wars fought outside their own national territories are somehow not real and therefore are acceptable. There are also those who believe that wars are inevitable but that  like games  they can be controlled or limited. From their perspective  it would be desirable and possible to confine any actual fighting to certain areas  to limit its scope. In many regions the rivalry between the super-Powers has created a context in which client armies  nourished on alien ideologies in the absence of other fare  face each other across hostile national boundaries. Less than 50 years ago many allowed themselves to be lulled into a false sense of security by the promise of peace with honor  it is now clear that the promise in fact meant throwing those perceived as weak to the wolves  in the selfish hope that their appetite would thereby be satiated. The development of the perception that conflicts can be managed or limited to certain areas deemed expendable is an extremely dangerous one.The risk that one of the so-called regional or local conflicts might erupt into a general and total war haunts the world today as never before since 1945. In many regions situations of conflict have become the norm  peace the exception. The areas of peace continue to shrink  those of war to expand. The reaction in most cases  despite the obvious dangers involved  has been strangely muted and totally inadequate  when not amounting to indifference.A million dead are the price of six years of war between Iran and Iraq  a war which continues with no end in sight. The consequences in terms of human and material losses are appalling. The dangers to the international community are well known. It is also sadly significant that the flow of weapons to both countries has continued uninterrupted throughout and that the number of suppliers has increased fourfold over the period. To the representative of a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  it is particularly disturbing that two developing countries should be at war with each other. There is a tragic irony in the situation  compounded by the fact that many of the weapons used by the belligerents are identical  manufactured in the same countries and provided by the same suppliers on the sidelines  to whom the war is nothing more than a god-sent occasion for business as usual. It is an additional ground for concern that both super-Powers are now observing a watchful neutrality  and many other states believe they have a right to feel vitally concerned in the area. If past experience is anything to go by  the involvement and the rivalry that is sure to follow will be far from constructive for either of the belligerents  or for the world community.It is claimed that the conflict between Iraq and Iran  like many others today equally fraught with potentially global consequences  has roots deep in the past. It is true that the past cannot be ignored. It is  however  equally true that it is easy to rationalize current crimes and aberrations in terms of what we have inherited. In other times that we like to pretend were more barbarous than ours  countless numbers of people have been put to death on political  religious or ideological grounds. It is certain  though  that the majority of them were the victims of intolerance  the most corrosive of all feelings throughout the ages.The same spirit is at work today in the eruption of ethnic and communal violence  of fanaticism  in the erection of racism in a system of organized repression  and in the bitter conflict of rival ideologies. It has within the last 15 years led to the occupation  then dismemberment  of the independent State of Cyprus. In Afghanistan it has pitted brother against brother in a bloody struggle fanned from outside. And in Kampuchea it threatens the total annihilation of a once proud civilization. Dialog without outside pressure and intervention can be positive and should be encouraged  like the direct contact between North and South Korea which should continue. We call upon both North and South Korea to continue peaceful negotiations towards reunification.Deep-rooted prejudices  the will for total power and the confrontation of ideologies acting singly or as a combination of factors hinder the prospects of a negotiated settlement for each of these countries. In none  however  can a militarily imposed outcome provide the foundation for a lasting peace. We will take the risk of flying against the kind of conventional wisdom that declares war to be an extension of diplomacy  and suggest that the use of force is in most cases nothing more than part of the problem and not a means to a solution. We reiterate our conviction that a viable and durable peace in each of these situations must be a negotiated one  acceptable in the first place to the people most deeply concerned and affected.In the light of the declarations of all involved that their aim is peace and stability  it would seem that the objectives should be readily attainable. It is  however  with deep misgivings that we are forced to recognize the wide gap between professed objectives and the realities of the brutal policies pursued. It is well known that long-established perceptions and policies deriving therefrom  however dangerous they might be to the world  do not and sadly cannot be expected to change overnight. It cannot be too strongly stressed  however  that what is needed in these circumstances is nothing less than a change of heart leading to the recognition that relative security for all is preferable to the chaos which hegemonic ambitions are certain to produce.The will for hegemony in the 1930s expressed in the demand for living space inexorably culminated in war. It is known that those who were then actively -preparing for war claimed to be acting on so-called principles which they described as sacred. It is a matter of deep concern that  in some quarters  arguments which are dangerously close to those then advanced are new invoked to justify what threatens to develop into yet another State-organized genocide to disgrace our century.The brutal repression of the peoples of southern Africa has been regularly and unanimously condemned by the international community. Yet outside this Assembly powerful voices have not been lacking to be raised in defense  if not of apartheid precisely  at least of the regime that perpetuates the policy. It is perhaps indicative of the times in which we live that people have been found who believe that South Africa is a democracy  a bastion of civilization defending the values of the free world. Others have been proclaiming that change is just around the corner and that what we need is patience  more patience and still more patience.In another difficult period people tried to come to terms with the excesses of a brutal regime based on racism or subsequently claimed that they had been frightened into silence. Either way their silence  and therefore tacit complicity then  will forever remain as a stain against our humanity. It was with the objective of preventing the kind of racism that made the holocaust of the war possible that it was found necessary  in the words of the Charter:""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".The regime in South Africa has deliberately established itself on a denial of the principles of the Charter  thus choosing to place itself beyond the pale of civilization. To underline its choice it has arrogated to itself the right to encourage and assist destablilization in the surrounding territories. To emphasize its contempt for accepted norms of international behavior.  it has engaged in a lengthy series of military incursions  raids and aggressions against its neighbors. It continues it illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance of the stated will of the international community and has effectively sabotaged patient efforts at negotiations by linking the question to completely extraneous issues.We must reluctantly confess to a mounting sense of despair when confronted with the attempts at sophistry to excuse and rationalize a situation that is not merely unreasonable  but clearly illegal  inequitable and immoral. Because time is fast running out we appeal to the friends of the peoples of South Africa  to the friends of all the peoples of South Africa  to assist in averting the chaos in active gestation there. We believe that it is within their power to do so. South Africa with its 30 million people needs neither the inequities of apartheid nor the terroristic suppression of its neighbours to emerge as a prosperous country with a respected place in the comity of nations.It is our considered view that the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners will go a long way towards decreasing tension in South Africa and paving the way towards progress in a process of peaceful change. Mauritius  if called upon  will very gladly assist in the search for a peaceful solution and will offer its good offices. Further  Mauritius is ready and willing  if called upon  to be the venue for talks and positive discussions between the South African authorities and the genuine representatives of the majority of the South African population.The enormous price in blood paid by our ancestors throughout history should at least teach us that progress towards peace and understanding has never been obtained by attempts to impose by force our own often narrow perceptions of truth on others. In today's politically and militarily polarized world  delusions about so-called chosen peoples or manifest destinies and the policies they generate can lead to consequences too frightening to contemplate. For the same reason it would be equally dangerous to attempt to impose our own exclusive security concerns on others. It is worse still when national security becomes the pretext for wars of aggression  illegal occupations  expropriations and annexations of territories  the denial of fundamental and basic rights to peoples and the dismemberment of entire nations.We are confronted in the Middle East and increasingly in Central America with a choice that on the face of it seems simple: either to become partners in peace and to start by developing the will thereto now  or to continue to live with the same dreary uncertainties that have plagued us for too long. The peoples in the Middle East would have every reason to feel that their situation has become still worse than it was when this Organization was first seized of the question.Tragically for the people concerned  the situation in Central America seems to be developing in the same direction of a protracted confrontation  with accelerated militarization  increasing armed attacks  hostile trading of allegations  escalating rhetoric and involvement of a growing number of foreign ""advisers""  ominously in the context of the rivalry between the super-Powers. The peace process initiated by the Contadora Group which has received unanimous approval seems to have been completely relegated to the background. Similarly  the conditions for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East have been repeatedly stated in and endorsed by this Assembly.The crucial question is whether it will be possible to summon the imagination and the generosity to recognize that persistence in preconceived ideas and fixed certainties  far from being indicative of strength  is an admission of fear and weakness. Twice in global wars in this century we have witnessed the degradation of the human spirit which war brings with it. Successive generations have - if I may be allowed to put it in this way - fathomed the abyss of their collective soul to find the sombre demons lurking there. But it has rightly been said that the power to choose between good and evil is within us all  and we have also been a witness to the nobility of that same human spirit in its often demonstrated capacity to transcend current differences to visualize a better future for the world.It is certainly not an accident that the people most revered by posterity are those who  instead of the arrogance of power  chose the humility of compassion in their search for solutions to the problems which confronted them. To them it was a self-evident truth  which it seems necessary to restate  that those whom we consider our enemies are not necessarily the demons we sometimes choose to paint them; but  like us  simply men  women and children - similar to us no doubt in their weaknesses but also in their aspirations  dreams and ideals  both for themselves and their children. The interdependence of humanity and the brotherhood of mankind are often proclaimed but  to our great misfortune  rarely lived up to. Today  however  we are in such a situation that we cannot afford to fail in our realization of this essential truth.It has been said that people who do not understand the past are condemned to relive it. The parallels between the current world situation and that preceding the outbreak of the Second World War are too striking to be overlooked. It is not within anyone's power to undo the past  but we do have the power to use its lessons as guidelines to establish a course for an acceptable future for our children. In the process of doing so we have to face and answer the question whether we can find in ourselves the resources to overcome and reverse the obstacles to peace  or whether  lemming like  we are condemned to the same catastrophic path down the precipice followed in the past. The dangers in the trend today are readily identifiable  but as in the past  like people caught in some terrible recurrent nightmare  we seem deprived of our faculty to act to avert them.Some of the best minds of the inter war period proclaimed their conviction that qualitative and quantitative improvements in arms could not create a safer world. Nevertheless  against sense and reason  policies continued to be based on the assumption that security could be made to rest on the accumulation of ever more destructive arsenals. In the run up to 1939 the commitment to internationalism was first insidiously undermined  then destroyed - its demise consummated by the cynical suppression of the independence of the oldest State in Africa. The reaction of the international community to an escalating series of other acts ofState terrorism perpetrated in violation of international law  solemn commitments and obligations is strongly reminiscent of the abdication today in the face of the same kind of transgressions. In the same period  under the delusion that they could thereby avoid the worst  a number of countries scrambled to a hastily patched system of adversary military alliances and security arrangements  even as the armies backed by their lethal weapons were unleashed upon the world.Except for the fact that the armies of the rival blocs are mostly still confined to their quarters  the description could apply to the 1980s as to the 1930s. Millions of men throughout the world are working overtime to plan  devise and churn out the weapons of destruction to be used in the next  and what could turn out to be the last  war ever fought by human beings. It is an aberration that in a world where the majority suffer from chronic want and hunger military expenditure for 1984 is reported to have exceeded $1 000 billion. The passivity in the face of the growing ""weapons culture"" raises the question whether the world is not already on an irreversible collision course. It seems  however  that we have not yet seen the worst  as the major super Powers commit themselves to large increases in military spending with a strong reliance on improved technology and a strong emphasis on modernization and expansion.The world-wide increase in arms production is matched by corresponding efforts to expand arms exports  marked by intense competition among a growing number of suppliers to provide ever more sophisticated weapons systems to willing clients. It is a devastating comment on the priorities which the world seems to have set itself when a decline in the flow of arms can be viewed and described as a ""world-wide crisis"". In some countries the dangerous perception that the sale of arms is beneficial  because it is thought to ensure economic gains and stability  is gaining ground. In an equally disturbing development many other countries  the main targets of arms transfer agreements  base their policies on the belief that the acquisition of weapons can guarantee security. In addition  both super-Powers  which are also the major suppliers  use arms transfers as a key element to attain their respective and adversary foreign policy objectives. It is therefore bitterly disappointing  but hardly surprising  that sustained international efforts to limit the global arms trade should have been thwarted.The consequence is that today the world finds itself dangerously close to the brink. The threat to the human race is increased by massive investments to build or expand stocks of chemical weapons and to modernize and improve chemical warfare capabilities. It is also ominous that support within military establishments for biological research has increased significantly  raising the terrifying specter that in the eventuality of hostilities highly lethal diseases might be unleashed upon a world without any means to cope with the ensuing chaos. The regime of international law forbidding the use of chemical weapons has been shaken by allegations of violations  while the likelihood of an international chemical weapons ban has been declared not to be a real possibility in the foreseeable future. The conventional and chemical weapons in the arsenals of the world are by themselves sufficient to put meaningful human life as we know it today at risk  ""the nuclear arsenals threaten to destroy millions of years of painful progress and to wipe away life itself from the face of the earth. We invite the leaders who hold the key to the future in their hands to meditate on the reflection which the first atomic test inspired in one of its witnesses. It reminded him  he said  of a line from the Hindu Scripture  the Gita: ""I am become Death  the Shatterer of Worlds"". These words have assumed a prophetic and sinister ring in the light of the destabilizing developments in nuclear weapons technology and new theories regarding their role in security policies.The leaders of both super-Powers have agreed that a nuclear war cannot be won and therefore must not be fought. The logical conclusion  it seems  is that as a first step any kind of nuclear proliferation should be curbed and technological developments checked. It is profoundly disturbing to find instead that the world is confronted with massive programs to improve nuclear weapons and to extend their deployment. The international community is being held hostage to the view that parity - which is admitted to be militarily meaningless - must be maintained; that perceived imbalances must be corrected; and that technological improvements and an extension of deployment are necessary to demonstrate will.Remembering the victims of the first use of atomic weapons in war  peoples throughout the world have united in prayer that such weapons should never be usedagain. There are  nevertheless  policies based on the assumption that nuclear weapons could be limited to selective employment in battle areas and damage limited. There are  therefore  powerful groups which believe that the nuclear threshold could be crossed and its consequences controlled. The nuclear-arms race also finds powerful abettors in those who profess to believe that nuclear superiority confers political advantages. Within certain circles  the insane perception is developing that a nuclear war can he fought and won. It is inadmissible that they should be allowed to inflict the possible consequences of their obsessions and paranoias on the world. The existing state of confrontation encourages the formulation and development of tendentious ideas. The division of the world into rival blocs is the most urgent menace to peace today. The tensions between the super-Powers and bloc rivalries threaten us with the terrifying prospect that the third world war might be unleashed anywhere at any time.We are aware that mere exhortations and expressions of hope will not do away with the deep political and historical differences behind the current conflicts. In the light of the perceived economic  security and political incentives  the production and transfer of arms may be expected to continue unabated. So long as notions of a so-called nuclear balance or equal security are allowed to dictate policies the world will be confronted with a qualitative arms race to achievemilitary superiority. The militarization of outer space threatens to become an irreversible reality. The testing and accumulation of nuclear weapons will keep increasing - both vertically and horizontally - so long as current views on strategy and national security prevail. International peace will continue to be made to rest on the threat of mutual assured destruction.More than 30 years ago  Albert Einstein warned us that the unleashed power of the atom had changed everything except our modes of thinking. The doctrine of deterrence at the center of current nuclear policies is based on a principle as old as the human race. The history of humanity is hardly proof of the validity of the principle. In the present circumstances  it does not offer any safeguard against errors or accidents  whether human or mechanical  or against some manic miscalculation. Besides  the professed rationale for the nuclear build-up is distrust of those perceived as ""the other side"". Yet proponents of the nuclear deterrent have to trust the ""other side"" not to use nuclear weapons. Such an expectation is unrealistic  and cannot be accepted as the basis for a durable peace. The call for new ways of thinking to overcome the current deadlock has been reiterated on several occasions. The community of nations is unanimous that there is an overwhelming common interest in establishing and preserving peace. Gathered in this Assembly  it has agreed on the objectives and principles of disarmament. The leaders of both super-Powers have stated that friendly competition must replace confrontation as the basis of super-Power relations. If the statements were meant seriously  then both super-Powers must be prepared to re-examine the implications of prevailing doctrines and policies on the use of force in international relations. It also follows that they must be willing to reconcile conflicting views on the substantive measures needed to increase confidence  ease tensions  strengthen security and establish co-operation. It might then become possible to establish peace on a commitment to joint survival rather than on a threat of mutual assured destruction. We believe that the resumption of negotiations and the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of the super-Powers represent opportunities which must not be missed. We can say without fear of exaggeration that these discussions hold the potential of determining the future course of our civilization. The right decisions would also pave the way for a fresh approach to the problems of development.It has been recognized that in a world of finite resources  there is an organic relationship between expenditures on armaments and economic and social development. The second United Nations special session on disarmament concluded that:""The vastly increased military budgets... and the development  production and deployment... of new types of weapons systems represent a huge and growing diversion of human and material resources... Existing and planned military programs constitute a colossal waste of precious resources which might otherwise be used to elevate living standards of all peoples; furthermore  such waste greatly compounds the problems confronting developing countries in achieving economic and social development."" (A/S-12/32  para. 61) The economic situation in most countries  however  even without the constraints of military expenditures would have been grim enough. The current tragedy in many African countries underlines the case for new initiatives to resolve the most pressing problems confronting the world economy. It would be wrong to interpret the call for new initiatives merely as a plea for the transfer of resources. For the South to benefit  it is not necessary that the North should lose. The North-South debate on economic co-operation is increasingly being cast in the same vein as the political and military relationship between the East and the West. The language used and policy choices made are often confrontational. We want to stress the view that the rhetoric and policies notwithstanding the reality is one of inescapable interdependence.This is clearly Illustrated both in the causes and consequences of the 1980-1982 recession  the longest in 50 years. Despite some recovery in the industrial countries the effects of the recession are still being keenly felt in most developing countries as we move towards 1986. International economic relationships continue to be threatened by the disorder in currency and capital markets. Recovery is hampered by the unmanageable debt situation and high interest rates. Growth and expansion are crippled by stagnation in funding  the drying up of international financial flows and restrictions on international trade. In the light of reduced demand in traditional markets  commodity prices remain very low. In most third-world countries  development in the 1980s has come to a halt  where it has not actually gone into reverse. The forced contraction in the developing countries in turn reduces the exports of the industrial countries  weakening the pace of their recovery.There is substantial agreement on what is wrong with the international monetary and financial system and with current trade policies. It is recognized that unless policy induced efforts are made to remove the constraints on the expansion in the world economy  the prospects for the future will remain uncertain. The measures taken in relation to the debt crisis may have bought time and staved off collapse  but no long-term solution to the underlying problems has been developed. The so-called adjustments imposed as a condition for the provision of bridging finance and for debt rescheduling have  in many developing countries  resulted in severe contraction  involving excessive social and human costs  with adverse effects on nutrition  health and education. The combined effects of contraction in several developing countries may also cause damage to future development prospects and prove prejudicial to global recovery. Genuine adjustment should aim instead at expanding the production and exports of debtor countries with a corresponding expansion in the imports of surplus countries.Recent experience in many developing countries has also demonstrated that prevailing interest rates negate improvements in trade balances achieved as a result of reduced expenditure. There is therefore an urgent need to reduce real interest rates  currently the highest in recorded history. Lower rates  however  are unlikely in the light of the fiscal and monetary policies pursued in the major countries  more specifically  in the United States. To the extent that high interest rates are the consequences of the mix of an expansionary fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy  decisions on the structural budget deficit in the United States will have a critical influence on the level of interest rates and in determining whether the debt situation can be managed.In addition to policy choices in the United States  there is a pressing need for a comprehensive rescheduling arrangement for debts. The temporary measures of the last few years are inadequate to meet a problem that will be with us until ways are found to consolidate much of the present debts on a long-term basis. The proposals that have been made to that end deserve to be examined and discussed in a spirit of co-operation and understanding. Any arrangement arrived at must take into consideration the effect of the high interest rates on all debtor countries  the consequences of adverse external shocks on the poorest countries and the situation in the least developed countries.Beyond the sterile debate on responsibilities for the present debt situation  a sustained recovery would also require the creation of conditions for the restoration of commercial lending to the debtor countries at appropriate levels. The absence of progress on this issue not only undercuts growth prospects in the developing countries but also jeopardizes the recovery in the industrial countries. The same powerful argument requires the international community to address itself to the problems created by the growth of protectionist pressures and the proliferation of trade restraints. For many in the industrial North  protection - in the shape of tariffs  quotas  safeguard clauses and other more covert forms  including subsidies - has become a means to prevent change by preserving outmoded industries. It not only threatens to condemn a large number of countries to permanent economic underdevelopment  but also damages the industrial countries themselves. Access to industrial markets is essential for many developing countries to improve their trade balance  service their debts and resume growth. The revival of exports to the third world is important to sustain the recovery in the industrial countries. There is therefore a strong case for global negotiations with the objective of increasing market access for the exports of developing countries.Even on the assumption of a favorable solution to the current disorder in international economic relationships  we would still be confronted with the problems of the poorest and least developed countries. The recession combined with other factors  both internal and external  has had a devastating effect on their populations. The economic and social situation in many places is undergoing a process of rapid degradation  threatening complete disintegration. The impact of the decline in commodity prices has been confounded by stagnation in official development assistance in the face of increasing needs. The retreat from multilateralism  manifest in reduced support to multilateral concessional flows  exposes the divisions in a world  which the logic of facts proclaims to be interdependent  without an increase in the volume of concessional flows and immediate improvements in the external environment  the very existence-of some countries as organized political  economic and social entities would be placed in jeopardy.We concede that in many developing countries there is a strong case for restructured policies to take into account the strengths and limits of their assets and resources. In particular  the arguments in favor of human resource development are overwhelming and deserve immediate attention. It is vitally important to identify and address the internal and policy induced constraints on development. It is equally important to establish priorities in the light of the needs of peoples and the capacity of countries to satisfy those needs. It is vital to continue to explore and develop the potential for regional and subregional co-operation in trade and production. Above all  the North-South dialog - now muted - based on a common realization of mutual interests must go on. The only alternative is to allow the current realities to play themselves out through interacting tragedies of missed opportunities and unrealized potential both in the industrial North and the developing South.It is often alleged that addresses in this Assembly convey an unduly pessimistic view of the world. We do not wear rose-tinted glasses and  therefore  can only call the realities as we see them. We lack the kind of imagination that perceives glories in the bloodshed and mutilations of wars. We find neither patriotism nor heroism in the indiscriminate killing of men  women and children  and of soldiers and civilians alike. Some of the best brains of our age have made it their business to perfect the weapons of mass destruction which threaten the human race with extinction. In a superb display of indifference to the aspirations of the international community  the super-Powers continue to advance their nuclear pawns in a dangerous game of brinkmanship. Their political and military rivalry  along with weapons transfers  have transformed extensive regions of the world into potential powder-kegs.In a world in which military expenditures consume a reported $1 000 billion annually  the sum devoted to world wide development assistance does not exceed $38.8 billion. The world spends more on military expenditure today than it does on health and education combined. Every year 15 million children in the developing countries are allowed to die through famine and malnutrition. This appalling tragedy occurs in a world which has the resources to feed them. More than two thirds of the world population live in a twilight economic zone  dependent on decisions over which they have no control. Many of them are condemned to the attrition of their living standards  to unemployment  hunger and a wrenching adjustment process  which for them takes place at the margin between life and death.Yet there is another way. The potential for it is in all of us as individuals and as nations. It has recently been demonstrated by individuals in the tremendous outburst of solidarity for the victims of drought and famine. It has also been demonstrated by Governments in a provision of assistance which transcends political and ideological barriers. In many cases of crisis  individuals and nations have displayed a capacity for sympathy and generosity which compels hope for the future. It is recognized that the current arms race represents not only an enormous waste of resources  but condemns us to live in fear of a possible nuclear holocaust. It is also recognized that the current disorders affecting international economic relationships create the kind of instability which might make a catastrophic war inevitable. The challenge that we face therefore is to harness the intelligence and imagination at our disposal in the struggle for a peaceful and prosperous world. We have the resources to that end. We need the commitment."
"86",4930,"MWI",40,1985,"Sir  on behalf of my President  His Excellency Ngwazi Dr. H. Karauzu Banda  the Government and the people of the Republic of Malawi  and on my own behalf  it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Ambassador de Pinies on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am convinced that his professional qualities  backed by years of diplomatic experience  uniquely qualify him for the high office of President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that  under his guidance  the General Assembly will be able to complete its work efficiently and successfully.I should also like to pay my country's tribute to youE predecessor  His Excellency Me. John Paul Firoino Lusaka  Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Republic of Zambia to the United Nations  for the able manner  wisdom and unparalleled diplomatic skills with which he presided over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I wish him well and the best for the future.On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Malawi I convey to the Government and the people of Mexico our heartfelt sympathy for the loss of life and property they suffered as a result of the recent devastating earthquakes which hit that country.The Secretary-General of the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  deserves special commendation for his efforts to bring peace to war-torn regions and for his personal mediation efforts  notably in the Iran-Iraq war and in Cyprus.The fortieth session of the General Assembly should be considered as the most important and unique session since the Organization's inception. This session of the General Assembly will go into the annals of history as one of the most important events. It is important because the world body is commemorating the fortieth anniversary of its existence. During those four decades the United Nations has made it possible for the world in general to enjoy the longest period of peace without another global war of the magnitude that was witnessed during the two world wars. This long period of peace and tranquility is attributed to the untiring efforts of the world body  without whose intervention the world would have once again experienced another ghastly  savage and destructive war employing the most modern weapons of destruction.The world body was founded to maintain international peace and security based cm the community of interests and concerted international endeavors to avoid a third world war. Thus the founding fathers were determined to prevent anotherglobal war  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which had twice brought untold loss and suffering to mankind and to uphold the fundamental right of each person to live a free life and to enjoy the protection of the law in his or her country.My delegation is aware that the maintenance of international peace and security is a complex and multi-faceted goal that impinges upon many different areas of human activity. In the quest to achieve international peace and security the nations of the world solemnly undertook to be tolerant of each other and to live as good neighbors  thereby affording the peoples of the world a happier life.The States Members of the United Nations have conferred upon the Security Council  one of the principal organs of the world body  primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Charter empowers the Security Council to deploy combat armed forces supplied by Member States to restore and maintain international peace and security.On many occasions the United Nations has been called upon to prevent dangerous and volatile situations from assuming proportions likely to start conventional wars. Despite many handicaps  setbacks  frustrations and lack of co-operation from Member States  the United Nations has continued to play an important role as a peace-making and peace-keeping Organization.While my delegation appreciates the role the United Nations plays in the maintenance of international peace and security  including through the Security Council  we are gravely concerned by the manner in which some States Members often freely  blatantly and flagrantly violate the decisions made and resolutions adopted by the United Nations. In order to enable the Security Council to implement its decisions and resolutions  all States Members have an obligation to render the Security Council their maximum co-operation.During the entire period of its existence the United Nations has adopted many resolutions on major issues  but implementing those resolutions has proved difficult  if not outright impossible  because of lack of political will on the part of Member States. Sometimes we have blamed the veto power exercised by the five permanent members of the Security Council as being responsible for rendering United Nations decisions and resolutions powerless and ineffective. Permit me to mention that it does not necessarily follow that majority resolutions and decisions are always practical. In this regard  use of the veto could be considered as positive.Through the United Nations States Members are afforded the opportunity to meet  to hold frank  construction discussions and to share views on problem-solving. I believe that over the years the United Nations has made great and significant contributions towards world peace and prosperity. Through its various specialized agencies the United Nations has served as a catalyst in stimulating and promoting action elsewhere. The world's socio-economic sectors have undergone profound changes and have now become interdependent. This interdependence  added to the complexities of the problem  leads at times to intense differences of views among the various groups of countries. But at the same time  they have underlined the mutuality of interests and the need for understanding and co-operation. We should therefore best commemorate the fortieth session by affirming the common desire of all Member States to continue to make sustained efforts to raise the standard of living in all countries. This is  in essence  the raison d'etre of the specialized agencies.I should like to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General and to all those countries that have  in one way or another  assisted the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The countries of that region have been severely affected by acute food shortages as a result of unprecedented prolonged drought  acceleratingdesertification  floods and adverse climatic conditions  as well as other natural disasters. Despite its great size  diversity and enormous economic potential  Africa still remains the least developed of all the continents. However  in accordance with the provisions of the Lagos Plan of Action  African countries have individually and collectively recognized the need to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and supply  collective self-reliance and sustained development. The efforts of the international community with regard to food grants  emergency-relief operations and related foreign aid are welcome and commendable  although they constitute temporary solutions to Africa's food crisis.What Africa requires is financial and technical assistance to enable the continent to improve its agriculture  train its agricultural personnel  conduct more research to improve crop yield  adopt modern methods of farming and move away from subsistence farming.If I may be permitted to digress a little  I should like to speak briefly about my own country. As the General Assembly may be aware  Malawi is predominantly an agricultural country with no minerals that can be exploited economically or commercially. However  I am pleased to inform this Assembly that we are self-sufficient in food production and our economy is largely based on agriculture and agro-based light industries. Malawi's self-sufficiency in food production and modest economic progress have been achieved because of the people's positive response to our leader's constant call for hard work in the fields and the peace and political stability prevailing in the country. The primary goal of Malawis development policies is to continue to raise and improve the standard of living of the entire population  especially those in the rural areas  who constitute 90 per cent of the country's population.The agricultural production derives principally from two sub-sectors  notably  small holder farming on customary land and estate or commercial farming on leasehold land. Small holder farming takes up about 70 per cent of the country's cultivable land area  while commercial farming covers only 5 per cent. The main role of the small holder sub-sector is to produce sufficient food crops for local consumption while the surplus is sold. The smallholders also produce cash crops for export and for local agro-based light industries. On the other hand  the estate sub-sector is the major foreign exchange earner  exporting tobacco  sugar  tea  tung oil  coffee and macadamia nuts.The critical economic situation prevailing in Africa and in many developing countries calls for immediate attention. It is a matter of deep concern to my delegation that four decades after the end of the war the just demand of developing countries for the eradication of economic backwardness  domination and exploitation and for the achievement of equitable development and progress has remained largely unfulfilled. Despite their best efforts  the pace of development has been seriously set back in many developing countries and  indeed  reversed in the least developed and poorest among the poor  where deprivation and abject poverty remain the daily plight of hundreds of millions of people. This is why we have been appealing for the establishment of a new international economic order.In his address to the Economic and Social Council last year  the Secretary-General warned the world in the following words:""The economic survival of many countries in Africa is now at stake. Unless the international community responds urgently and adequately  the consequences for Africa will be very serious. But the consequences will be equally serious for the world as a whole.""My delegation would therefore like to take this opportunity to appeal to the developed and industrialized nations to provide the developing countries with more technical and financial assistance to enable them to overhaul and revamp their economies  which have been seriously hit as a result of high interest rates  indebtedness and low prices for their export commodities  coupled with the generally worsening economic climate. We appeal to the developed countries to consider the developing countries as partners in progress  because their development and well-being are closely linked with the development and well-being of the developing countries. It would  indeed  be a most welcome humanitarian gesture if the lending countries were to consider the possibility of converting official loans and development aid into grants in order to alleviate the economic burden of the low-income countries. We further appeal to all potential and traditional donors for more assistance to Africa. We believe that the world community is capable of rendering generous assistance to Africa  which is ravaged by food shortages  financial hardships  balance-of-payments problems  drought  hunger  desertification and acute transport problems.I should like now to say something about matters affecting our region. I refer specifically to the political situation currently prevailing in southern Africa. Our region is yearning for peace. We are aware that there exists a close relationship between peace and development and that these two elements are not mutually exclusive and cannot be pursued in isolation one from the other. Indeed  progress in the achievement of one facilitates the achievement of the other and vice versa. The interrelationship between peace and development is particularly crucial and relevant in the circumstances currently prevailing in our region.My delegation is obviously concerned over the unresolved political impasse in Namibia. While the process of decolonization has reached its final and most decisive phase  we note with great concern that the people of Namibia have not as yet attained their rightful independence. The war that is raging in that part of our region has claimed  and continues to claim  many innocent lives on both sides  and in the process property worth millions of dollars has been destroyed. The Government of Malawi firmly supports the call for independence and self-determination for Namibia and fervently believes that the only viable solution to the problem is through the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The independence of Namibia should not be linked to any extraneous issues which are outside the ambit and framework of the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).Any deliberate action or move aimed at undermining and concentrating attempts at finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the Namibian problems not beaccepted by any of the peace-loving nations.My delegation welcomes any moves in our region that are geared towards the achievement of peace and peaceful solutions to our problems. The importance of peaceful coexistence cannot be over-emphasized. Indeed  hostilities betweenneighboring countries should not be encouraged. We believe that through co-operation a new epoch of peace and security could be ushered into our region.I believe that the problems facing our region can best be solved through the policy of contact and dialog. At the assent  we are concerned about the apparent failure to find a just and lasting solution to the problems facing our region. My Government does not believe in the use of force or violence in solving problems and disputes. Equally  we do not subscribe to the policy of isolation and boycott.The General Assembly is aware that the international community is now pressing for disinvestment and mandatory sanctions in order to bring about chancy and meaningful political reforms in South Africa.I strongly appeal to the proponents of this philosophy to reconsider the matter on the grounds that economic sanctions are bound to be detrimental and are bound to cause sure hardships to the majority of black people than to the minority white population. Indeed  as South Africa has itself predicted  the economic repercussions and reverberative effects would also adversely affect the neighboring countries.With regard to conflict areas in the Middle East  Asia and South-East Asia  we appeal to the Secretary-General to continue to use his good offices in order to find just and lasting solutions which would be acceptable to the parties involved. I believe that negotiated settlements in these regions should be speedily pursued because international peace is the concern of my Government. In this connection  I would like to take the liberty to applaud the efforts undertaken by several peace-loving nations in the search for durable peace in these regions. My delegation believes that the total and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from these regions would certainly enhance the chances of finding durable and just solutions to the problems. I would like the peoples of these regions to be afforded the opportunity to choose their own leaders and to determine their own destiny without foreign interference and intervention in their internal affairs.The question of Cyprus also deserves mention by my delegation. My delegation calls for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus. We would like to see peace prevail Cyprus  and this could best be achieved if the two communities were afforded  without foreign intervention  the opportunity to hold further inter-communal and proximity talks. In this regard  we believe that a solution acceptable to both communities might be worked out.My delegation would like to point out that there is a close dynamic interrelationship between peace and international security and disarmament. I am  therefore  calling for effective measures to halt the arms race  in particular the nuclear arms race. I equally support all efforts  bilateral and multilateral  aimed at genuine nuclear disarmament and arms limitation. My delegation's concern is in respect of the probability of unleashing a nuclear war which would be extremely catastrophic. Huge sums of money are spent on nuclear weapons  and I appeal to the developed nations to channel these funds to other developmental activities in the developing countries in order to improve the health  education  nutritional status  and the general standard of living of their peoples.May I be permitted to reiterate once more my Government's belief in the policy and philosophy of contact and dialog as the only practical way of solving most of the world's political problems and conflicts. Therefore  Malawi believes passionately in the noble ideals for which the United Nations stands  which are world peace  international security  and justice. These fundamental ideals could be realized through peaceful discussions among nations and not through threats  violence or war.During the last 40 years of its existence  the United Nations has done commendable work in the promotion and maintenance of international peace  and I appeal to all the members of this Assembly to rededicate themselves to the noble principles and purposes of the Charter and to support effectively our Organization.Finally  may I be permitted to assure the General Assembly that the constructive efforts of our Organization  in its search for peace  security and justice  will always enjoy the full support of the Government of the Republic of Malawi."
"87",4976,"MYS",40,1985,"Mr. President  may I on behalf of the Malaysian Government congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election to preside over this historic session of the General Assembly reflects the high regard in which you are held as a diplomat of outstanding ability and experience. I am confident that  like your predecessor  your adroit leadership will effectively chart the course of this fortieth session. I should also like to pay tribute to our esteemed Secretary-General who has shown that the most impossible job in the world can indeed be done creatively and effectively.The United Nations is an assembly of sovereign States and the world is its constituency. At the outset  then  in the full glare of questions and expectations on the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  may I without hesitation state that the United Nations has done well and although it can do better  the world is certainly a better place today than it was in 1945. But there is indeed need to do more as we confront challenges which threaten the United Nations as an open forum of multilateral diplomacy.The effective functioning of the United Nations is difficult enough without detractors. Those that cannot get their own way compound that difficulty through propaganda. Propaganda claims that many Member States vote with or vote against one or the other of the two super-Powers. This is presumptuous and a slur on the Member States' right and ability to vote. To me  the coincidence of our voting patterns with one or other of the two super-Powers depends on the attitude of these super-Powers themselves. We reject the allegation.that the United Nations is controlled by an automatic majority and that the automatic majority pushes through extreme and unrealistic resolutions. These allegations fail to consider the responsible and painstaking efforts made to work for a consensus on major issues. Surely it must be appreciated that we vote on issues rather than on whom to please  or to displease for that matter.While the polemics between the two super-Powers are issues that they themselves must address  we who are not involved will stress the need for reasoned and rational dialog which is  after all  what diplomacy is all about  and what the United Nations is  or should be  all about. Certainly we will do all we can to ensure that debates will throw light rather than heat  and that resolutions will be arrived at  to the extent possible  by a broad consensus.There is  however  one aspect of this matter which we must not forget. For much of the world  the outlook is desperate and almost hopeless. We are merely raising our voices in the hope that they  and we  may be heard. We seek to express our appeal and our indignation on behalf of the wretched of the world  the poor  the dispossessed  and the alienated  who are all part of our common humanity. We seek to remind the callous and the complacent of the indecency and horror of apartheid  of the cruel disregard for the rights of the Palestinian people  and of the continuing struggle of so much of humanity to ensure minimally decent lives for themselves and their children. I venture to suggest that the tone of the international dialog will be transformed beyond recognition if on these three issues we can all be seen to pull together.We are outraged at the perversity of the apartheid system itself  which seeks to strip forever every fundamental right of the vast majority on the basis of color  and at the brutality and cruelty of the South African regime which makes war on everyone who dares to challenge its dogma of white supremacy. This is a regime which openly invades  destabilizes and intimidates its neighbors of which the aggression against Angola in the past week is only the latest example.It clings to Namibia in defiance of the international community. But we are also outraged at the complacency and the double-talk of those who  having finally uttered words of condemnation  then go on to find all manner of excuses to do . nothing effective. The apartheid regime is a moral evil and a threat to the world. We must collectively give clear notice of our resolve to work for its dismantlement and within a conceivable time-frame.Turning to Palestine  what we insist on is a commitment to an independent State of Palestine. It is beyond comprehension to me how it can be asserted that the Palestinians  an ancient and historical people  should be denied the right to their own independent homeland. Hence  we raise our voices in outrage at Israeli intransigence  at the Israeli policy of annexation  invasion of neighboring countries  and brutal treatment of its victims. We are outraged by Israeli brand of ""justice""  which was seen most recently and shamelessly in its act of aggression against Tunisia only three days ago. But we are also outraged by those that continue to give Israel unquestioning support  which only encourages its intransigence. Is it any wonder  then  that we are disenchanted?I referred earlier to the continuing struggle of so much of the world to improve its economic lot  which is sometimes no more than a struggle to move up one notch from going to bed hungry every night  which is the lot of some 800 million people on this earth. Here I plead for a sense of urgency and of shared purpose. We must address ourselves with equal vigor to a world of massive unemployment in which the debt problem threatens the survival of the international financial system  in which commodity prices have fallen in real terms to their lowest levels for 50 years  in which protectionism has raised its head even more dangerously. But positive action at the multilateral level has been conspicuously wanting. There is  alas  no international forum in which North-South dialog is being seriously conducted today.The economic development of the developing countries must  of course  remain their own primary responsibility. But our efforts against great odds must be matched by the developed countries in terms of financial flows and supportive trade  monetary and economic policies. This is not a plea for charity or benevolence. It is only a reminder of the interdependence of the contemporary world  of shared interest and  therefore  of shared responsibility. Yet the experience of the last few years has been disquieting. We have seen too much of trade barriers  of market manipulation at the expense of primary producers  of exclusive economic clubs  and of aid in the form of military hardware  which benefits the provider more than the receiver * The challenge is urgent and fundamental. The outlook is indeed gloomy unless we can rise to that challenge together.We all also face a common challenge  and we all also share a common interest in the survival of the human race. History would have taught us nothing if we ignored the fact that the two world wars were caused in part by the failure of the great Powers to achieve the limitation and reduction of national armaments by international agreement. We recognize that no progress towards nuclear disarmament can be made unless proposals originate from the major nuclear Powers themselves and unless there is mutual acceptance by the major Powers of the need for real and qualitative improvements in their relations. We therefore hope that the meeting soon to take place between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev  would usher in a spirit of true co-operation which will open the road to nuclear disarmament.The threats to the world stem not only from nuclear annihilation but  more immediately  from limited  local wars and conflicts. Sadly  there are too many examples  but here I will refer only to the situations in Central America  inAfghanistan and in South-East Asia. In each instance  important principles of the Charter - the non-use of force.  the territorial integrity of States  the right of self-determination of peoples and the peaceful settlement of disputes - are at stake.In Central America the situation is fast approaching a critical point: either the Contadora process will move forward or a dangerous downward spiral will be set in train  with tragic consequences. Malaysia supports the Contadora countries  which are undertaking truly regional efforts to resolve regional issues free from East-West ideological conflict. These efforts to ensure that the struggle of peoples for freedom  development and justice can be managed solely in their own interest  without external interference  deserve the support of us all.In Afghanistan  a vicious and bloody war continues  and the victims are the brave people of that ancient nation. The United Nations must let them know that the cause of their freedom is not forgotten and thereby send a message to nations  powerful or weak  that we shall never allow force to be the arbiter of any nation's fate. Malaysia calls upon all to assist in practical ways the Mujahideen freedom fighters in their valiant struggle  as well as to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to seek a durable political solution.The occupation of Kampuchea by Viet Nam persists in defiance of the will of the international community so clearly and repeatedly affirmed by resolutions passed by this Assembly. Seven years have indeed passed  but this Assembly must show that its stamina and its attention span will last as long as necessary to ensure that peace  freedom and self-determination return to the Kampuchean people. This Assembly should neither dilute its principles nor fall prey to all manner of subterfuges to avoid consideration of the essential issues  namely  the withdrawal of Vietnamese occupation forces and the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to choose their own government.While remaining firm on principles  Malaysia and other countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have always shown our flexibility and our sincere desire to bring the present conflict to an end by peaceful means. Most recently  we have proposed that proximity talks be held as a means of breaking the present impasse. Unfortunately  Viet Nam's response has been negative. Malaysia and the other ASEAN countries have repeatedly stated that we are committed to a political  not a military solution to the present conflict. We are pleased that conversations do take place between Viet Nam and ASEAN and other countries for that purpose. Unfortunately they have been fruitless  and the most graphic demonstration of Viet Nam's intentions so far is the massive military offensive during the last dry season.Looking to the future  Malaysia would like to make its contribution to a more safe and orderly world by raising issues which are of global concern and on which action is both necessary and possible. That is why my country  together with some others  has raised the two issues of narcotic drugs and Antarctica.The immensity of the drug problem is vividly illustrated by a finding in a recent study that in one major country alone the earnings of traffickers in cocaine  heroin and marijuana have been estimated at between $US 90 and $US 100 billion per year  a sum which may well exceed the national budgets of most of the developing countries combined.Aside from the human costs of drug addiction  which are tragic  these tremendous resources in the hands of drug traffickers are the best illustration of the changed dimension of the international drug problem  which cannot be regarded any longer as a social or humanitarian problem but must be regarded as one which threatens the stability  development  security and very survival of States and Governments. That is why my Government  together with others  is insisting that the international drug problem must be met with a heightened sense of urgency. It is with this sense of urgency that this session of the General Assembly should unanimously endorse the proposal by the Secretary-General to convene an international conference on drugs in 1987 so that preparatory work can proceed expeditiously.The facts about Antarctica are well known: it covers one tenth of the globe; there is no agreement on sovereignty; it occupies a strategic location  it has a fragile ecosystem  it is of enormous scientific interest  and it possesses rich marine and mineral-resources. The question  therefore  is: how should such a region of the globe be managed in the best interest of all mankind? Why should the United Nations be excluded from involvement?In dealing with Antarctica  my Government does not seek to confront the Antarctic Treaty parties or to destroy what they have successfully created. Rather we seek to build upon what they have achieved. Bearing in mind the characteristics of Antarctica  we wish to see that the system for the management of that continent is one which would be accountable to the international community  which would make it possible for the relevant international agencies to be more directly involved and which would ensure that the fruits of the exploitation of its resources could be .more equitably shared as the common heritage of mankind but taking into account the position of the claimant States. In other words  accountability  involvement and equity should be the elements of the system for managing Antarctica.In dealing with this matter we recognize that the issues involved are legally complex and politically delicate. That is why Malaysia continues to believe that a committee of the United Nations should be established to examine in particular the relationship between the Antarctic Treaty system and the United Nations system so as to reconcile the interest that the international community undoubtedly has in Antarctica with what exists and what has been achieved under the Antarctic Treaty system.The last four decades have seen the evolution of international institutions so that today we have in place the necessary tools to deal with the many problems which face us. Increasingly  however  the question is whether we want to use them  whether we still believe that the way forward lies in multilateral co-operation. The road to multilateralism is fraught with frustration  not only for the major Powers  which are no doubt often tempted to take the short-cut of the unilateral solution  but for many others as well  who see so little progress on issues of vital significance to them. But in the long term  it is the only feasible road to advance our common interest in a world of peace and freedom  development and human justice. In this  the fortieth anniversary year of the United Nations  Malaysia pledges to do its utmost in all practical ways to strengthen the spirit of multilateralism  to build upon what exists and always to push forward the frontiers of international co-operation."
"88",5049,"NER",40,1985,"Just a few  days ago  Mexico  its land and its great people suffered one of the most devastating and extensive earthquakes  we can still see the heartrending pictures. Therefore  at the outset it is my duty to address to the delegation of that friendly country the sincere condolences of the delegation of Niger.Your accession to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. Sir  at a crucial and very significant moment in the destiny of our Organization and of the peoples comprising it  is a well-deserved tribute to you and to your outstanding qualities as a statesman and negotiator  as a talented diplomat whose style and spirit have so greatly enriched the work of this General Assembly. This unanimous tribute extends beyond you to your country  to your King and to your people. We pay tribute to Spain's undying devotion to the ideals of the United Nations  and appreciate its consistent and distinguished contribution to the solution of the problems faced by the world today.In your distinguished post  you follow an outstanding son of a great nation  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  who  in a masterly  sophisticated and distinguished manner  presided over the work of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session. Africa is rightly proud of him.Now  on behalf of my country I should like to express thanks and sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his dedication in carrying out his work. His keen awareness of the problems of the countries of the Sahel  his initiatives in the area of the maintenance of peace and the solution of problems affecting the community of nations earn him our deepest respect and our encouragement.The international community is getting ready to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the united Nations. It is a very fitting commemoration  for indeed what better opportunity than this anniversary for reflection and taking stock? What better opportunity than this to recall and extol the foundations of the united Nations? What better time than this to propose to the community of nations a more noble image  a more human approach  a goal consonant with its unshakable faith in man? The Charter of the United Nations reflects an enlightened vision  a noble and realistic vision  of international relations. The ideals it embodies  the principles it sets forth  are still relevant today and deserve our full support.Our support for the Charter stems from our devotion to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  our love for peace and security  our commitment to preserve a world balance; our ability to organize and maintain effective solidarity among all the nations of the world  and our sincere desire to build and strengthen economic and social progress for the entire human race.As has been recalled by President Seni Kountche  our leader  we of Niger are a people that loves peace  peace in dignity  peace with respect for other people's values  peace which involves a reasonable and fair sharing of the fruits of co-operation among the peoples of the earth.That explains our stubborn rejection of all injustice  domination and use of force. It explains why we share the impatience and frustrations felt by developing countries in the face of this crisis that is undermining the world economy and hindering our efforts to achieve happiness  calm and peace. Above all  it is what kindles our unshakable faith in the United Nations and our burning desire to see its work directed with more resolve and highest priority to a search for solutions to the conflicts affecting the world.Here I am thinking of the imminent danger to world peace and security posed by the survival of apartheid and colonialism in southern Africa. South Africa's illegal occupation of the territory of Namibia  25 years after the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  is undeniably a serious and continuing challenge to the authority and credibility of the United Nations.After more than half a century of brutal and degrading colonialism  and following the Security Council's adoption of resolution 435 (1978)  Africa hoped that Namibia would swiftly accede to international sovereignty. But today we are obliged to note that South Africa is still occupying Namibia  which means that there have been seven more years of indescribable suffering for the people of Namibia  and countless numbers of raids and acts of aggression against the front-line States:  seven years of hope and trust betrayed.Within South Africa itself  the minority regime in power is constantly pursuing and strengthening its loathsome policy  which it calls a policy of the separate development of the races  to that end using a whole arsenal of laws and regulations. Everything is permitted for some; they can do what they want with the others. Yet nothing is permitted for the others in their own land.The General Assembly and the Security Council have in turn stated and declared that apartheid is incompatible with the United Nations Charter  and the international community has declared it to be a crime against humanity.Today it is accepted that only through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the dismantling of the system of apartheid can a just and lasting peace be brought about in that ravaged part of our continent.But if South Africa continues to disregard and insolently trample underfoot our collective desires  we have no choice but to continue the struggle in a dynamic  collective and responsible manner. And here I would pay a well deserved tribute to international public opinion and I would encourage it  for today it is doing a great deal for the cause of justice  human dignity and peace. Thanks to its support for the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa  South Africa's isolation is increasing with each passing day. Public opinion exposes its blind arrogance and its overweening conceit. Africa would urge public opinion to intensify its pressure and to militate even more for the adoption of economic sanctions and other appropriate measures against the racist and aggressive regime of Pretoria. That is the only language that this regime understands.Its last barbaric incursion into the territory of Angola is further proof of its intransigence. We condemn that raid as a serious infringement of international rules and of the sovereignty and independence of of the people of Angola.Other parts of the vast African continent have for years been areas of great tension. Dangerous and potentially explosive situations still persist in Chad  Western Sahara and the Horn of Africa.In our view  these conflict situations constitute a major obstacle to the ideal of African unity  which is the deepest aspiration of the peoples of our continent. They are a distraction  because they sidetrack our people from the paramount tasks of development and social progress.In Niger we believe that the settlement of all these conflicts inevitably calls for respect for the principles of international law  to which all of our peoples have subscribed in an act of sovereignty.Hence  the independence and sovereignty of Chad must be respected. National reconciliation must be sought  maintained and encouraged by the people of Chad themselves without any outside interference.The situation in Western Sahara is a matter of grave concern to Niger. There are ongoing efforts to promote the effective implementation of the right to self-determination.Lastly  the return to peace in the Horn of Africa depends on the will of the countries of that region to respect one another and to abide in their relationships with the rules of good-neighborliness.Africa  through the Organization of African Unity  is actively seeking solutions to all these conflicts. We are following with hope the efforts being made by the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  Mr. Diouf  President of the Republic of Senegal  to ensure peace  justice and democracy. These efforts ought to be strongly supported by the United Nations and by all countries that cherish peace and justice.The situation in the Middle East is  like the problem of Namibia  another example of a challenge that we must face in order to restore our Organization's authority and credibility.We would recall that Israel was created by our Organization  but it has been forgetting the lessons of history and trying to deny other peoples' right to exist. This attitude on the part of Israel is at the root of the indescribabletragedy that has been experienced by the Palestinian people for decades. They have been driven out of the land of their ancestors  deprived of their rights and properties and unjustly forced into permanent exile.The United Nations has a major responsibility to the Palestinian people. Admittedly  it has not abdicated all these responsibilities  but  unfortunately  its efforts have come up against Israel's arrogance and intransigence. Israel  flouting law and morality  continues to occupy Arab territories and to harass the Arab people of Palestine and to commit aggression with impunity against States in the region. The destruction a few days ago of the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization  in violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Tunisian people  is indicative of the incalculable risks in that part of the worId.We continue to believe that a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the Middle East and of Palestine necessarily involves a total Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and its right to establish its own independent and sovereign State in its homeland  Palestine  and the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in any peace process in the region.Other parts of the world where the fate of international peace and security is at stake also require attention and urgent action on the part of the international community.In the Gulf  where war continues between two brotherly countries  Iran and Iraq  the initiative for the restoration of peace must be supported and maintained by all  and we continue to work along those lines.The continued occupations of Afghanistan and Kampuchea are matters of serious concern to many States. By an overwhelming majority the General Assembly has called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from those two countries  for respect for their independence and sovereignty and for the preservation of their non-aligned states.In Central America  which is in the throes of serious upheaval and instability  Niger hopes that a negotiated settlement of the problems of the region with respect for the sovereign aspirations of each people can be achieved. In this spirit  we applaud and support the efforts of the Contadora group.In speaking of conflicts  I should like also to mention the situation in the Korean peninsula  where the tension that arose with the division of Korea still exists. In this connection  Niger believes that the problem of the division of Korea is a political problem and that a solution must be sought by peaceful means in accordance with the aspirations of the Korean people.We are glad that 24 October also marks the beginning of a week which the General Assembly has decided to devote to the question of disarmament throughout the world. This decision reflects the great awareness of the international community as it is faced with the implementation of the fundamental objective of the Charter  namely  to preserve future generations from the scourge of war. Forty years after that commitment was entered into  the risks of confrontation add to the fears of the peoples of the United Nations  which are witnessing an exponential increase in arras expenditures. These expenditures have quadrupled between 1945  when the United Nations was founded  and the end of the first Disarmament Decade. In 1983 global military expenditures rose to $750 billion. Specialists have estimated that in 1985 the amount will be some $1 000 billion. Yet it is broadly recognized that a considerable reduction in such expenditures would not only help to ease tension in the world but also help to restore the growth of the world economy and would help to increase assistance levels for the support of developing countries.It was because of the current economic situation in the world that I referred  quite deliberately  to the parallel between the mind-boggling levels of military expenditures and the resources  pathetically small compared to the immensity of the needs  provided for development assistance for third-world countries. The economic problems facing the world are as serious and dangerous as the many conflict situations I have just described. The growing gap between the rich and the developing countries contains the seeds of instability and also crystallizes the threats to peace in the world.The inability of the mechanisms for trade and co-operation to meet present needs has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis affecting all international economic  trade  financial and monetary relations. In most countries this crisis has taken the form of rising inflation  serious recession and constantly worsening social tensions. For our developing countries  to these are added a worsening of the terms of trade  difficulties in access to the financial markets  increasingly burdensome debt servicing and a disruptive decrease in development assistance.Therefore this is an urgent matter  particularly with regard to the agonizing debt problem: more than $170 billion for Africa alone. This problem is not only a question of contracts anymore. It is part of macro-political vision: too many demands on the part of lenders would inevitably engulf the borrowers and thus have unfavorable repercussions on the lenders. It is in the interest of all for some middle ground to be found.However  the problems of the United Nations are also and above all the problems of Africa: namely  the inability of a continent that was the cradle of mankind to feed its own people on its own. This is a situation which results from the difficulties we have encountered in managing our agricultural system  in building the infrastructure needed to irrigate our arid zones  to open our regions to provide for a better distribution of our products  to establish a true African policy for complementarity and co-operation among our States  particularly in the struggle to combat desertification and in the essential area of water control. These difficulties are accompanied by others that are just as troublesome  involving education  health  and housing for our people  whom we wish to enable to manage their lives properly so that they can participate more actively and more honorably in the development of our continent and of the entire world. Many voices have been raised here to emphasize this tragic situation in Africa.The General Assembly itself took up this matter at the thirty-ninth session and adopted resolution 39/29  the Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa. In this connection  there is perhaps nothing more serious or that requires action by the world community more urgently than this agonizing problem of hunger in Africa. Nothing that is said or written can really convey the dimensions of this tragedy and its impact on people. And here I should like to thank most sincerely  on behalf of President Seyni Kountche  the present Chairman of the Inter-state Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel  friendly countries  the agencies of the United Nations system  non-governmental organizations and people of good will throughout the world for the humanitarian assistance that they have given us in this difficult period for our continent.For almost 17 years Africa has been gripped by an implacable drought that has led to a serious reduction in the availability of water and arable land  the destruction of vast areas of fauna and flora and the death through hunger and thirst of thousands of men  women and children.This situation is a matter of acute concern to African Governments which  at the national  subregional and continental levels  have tried to take the first steps towards a solution.At the national level  African leaders have undertaken to redefine agricultural strategies and to maintain  diversify and reconstitute vegetation  to ensure soil preservation  to develop water resources to ensure food security by promoting and developing food crops and livestock.Efforts to harmonize these initiatives have been made at the subregional and continental levels. Thus  within the context of the Inter-State Committee to Combat Drought in the Sahel  eight countries have developed an agreed program of rehabilitation  giving priority to water control  combating desertification through reforestation  developing agriculture and livestock and building buffer stocks of grain.At the continental level  lastly  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had undertaken a thorough re-examination of ways and means of coping with this situation. This has led to the establishment of the special fund for emergency assistance in the struggle against drought and famine in Africa  and major contributions have already been pledged.	Obviously  it is no longer a question of counting exclusively on outside aid; above all  Africa must utilize its resources and its inner strength  the liberating weapon in a victorious struggle against hunger. Only a pragmatic strategy geared to fundamental needs and the political determination to carry out a thorough reorientation of economic systems through reviewing agrarian practices and policies can enable us to take the first steps towards a solution to the food problem.Yet the African continent  to which most of the poorest countries of the world belong  cannot alone cope with this enormous and serious challenge of nature.It is therefore more necessary than ever that international solidarity is more effectively directed to saving the lives of millions people in the short term and  in the long term  to enabling the African people to make themselves self-sufficient in food. Forceful  even exceptional measures will be needed to get a dynamic process of rehabilitation and consolidation under way. Those measures must be consonant with those that were taken to assist in the reconstruction of Europe after the Second world War.President Seyni Kountche said from this very rostrum that ""our world is today drifting away from a sense of measure  of sharing  of generosity"". And he added:""There is a danger that by 1990 800 million human beings will live in a state of absolute poverty  in other words  below the level of any rational definition of human dignity. Thousands of men  women and children throughout the world die every day of hunger  if not of diseases that could have been avoided if they had been better fed. Entire nations in the southern hemisphere are not able fully to exercise their sovereignty because  with their pathetic incomes  which are often completely unrelated to their true resources and the tremendous efforts made by their people  they are stagnating.""At this time of political and economic crisis  as we commemorate 40 years of common endeavor  we should ask ourselves: is this the world we pledged to build?"
"89",5094,"NGA",40,1985,"Mr. President  in the name of the Nigerian delegation  I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the President warmly on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. His long and distinguished experience in the United Nations gives us confidence that he will most competently guide the deliberations of the Assembly. I wish him every success in the months ahead.I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the excellent manner in which he presided over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In the same vein  permit me  Mr. President  to express my thanks and appreciation to our distinguished Secretary-General  for his untiring efforts in the service of the international community.My Government has already expressed its deep condolence to the Government and people of Mexico on the recent earthquake. May I  however  take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to show solidarity with Mexico in the true spirit of human brotherhood.Throughout the world the fortieth anniversary of the funding of the United Nations is being observed with mixed feelings. There is much to cheer and applaud in the record of the United Nations. Forty years after its founding  the world is much better off with  than without  the United Nations. The Organization has achieved a lot in the areas of decolonization  human rights  health  peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. The specialized agencies in the system have improved the quality of life of millions of people throughout the world  within their areas of competence.These accomplishments  however  are overshadowed by the threat to human existence arising from super-Power nuclear rivalry  the unsettled political situation in almost every part of the world  and the constant decline in the economic condition of the majority of the world's population. Yet  the effectiveness of the United Nations to cope with these global problems seems to be at an all-time low. The Organization is being gripped by a paralysis which is indicative of the determination of some powerful Members to avoid the constraints of multilateralism  the more easily to be able to impose unilateral solutions to international problemsThe United Nations is at a cross-roads. Its Members are faced with two options. We can continue along the present path of rendering the Organization increasingly ineffective and irrelevant to the crucial issues of our time. That is a choice that can lead only to catastrophe. Alternatively   we can choose to revitalize the Organization  to enhance its effectiveness and to make it live up to the hopes conceived by the founding fathers. The requirement of survival dictates that we choose this second option. The United Nations must be revitalized and strengthened. For this to happen we have to confront collectively the political as well as the structural crises afflicting it. Since the Organization is a structure of our own creation and a tool in our own hands  it can be effective only to the extent that Members allow it to be. This fortieth session should be an opportunity for us all to demonstrate the political will that is the basic ingredient of revitalization. The permanent members of the Security Council  who  under the Charter  have the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  will particularly have to demonstrate the will to find a new approach more consonant with the universal hope reposed in the United Nations.The time is ripe for new initiatives to prevent this Organization from being paralyzed and to prevent cold-war suspicions and considerations from holding back the evolution of solutions to the pressing problems of mankind. Let us never despair of building bridges between protagonists. Let us never despair of thinking thoughts and dreaming dreams in an endeavor to bring sanity to the world. This responsibility does not rest with the big Powers alone; it rests with all of us.The primary purpose of the United Nations is the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. In its 40 years of existence no world war has broken out. That is something worth cheering. However  there have been and still are several localized wars in many parts of the globe. These wars have claimed more lives than the Second World War. Moreover  they have been and are being fought in the Third World  in areas least able to afford the accompanying destruction and devastation. Even when the signs of the outbreak of such wars are seen  the United Nations  in particular the Security Council  is rendered incapable of taking preventive action in accordance with the Charter. The Organization therefore often looks on helplessly while wars break out and are fought for as long as the antagonists want. Collective security  which was predicated on a degree of consensus among the major Powers  has given way to a polarization of the world into two rival alliances each of which has developed the concept of security based on the competitive accumulation of nuclear weapons. As a result of this arms race  the world is faced with the ultimate peril of total destruction.For the first time in the history of the human race man has within his power and capability the means by which he could annihilate many times over the whole of life on earth. Rather than enhancing security  the accumulation of nuclear weapons has become the greatest source of global danger. Yet the super-Powers that are responsible for this very grave situation are not disposed to show any serious commitment to reducing the levels of such weapons in the interest of the survival of humanity. Let it not be said that the United Nations has not constantly drawn attention to that danger. In two special sessions devoted to disarmament and in countless resolutions adopted at its regular sessions the General Assembly has not only characterized in vivid terms the danger posed by nuclear weapons but drawn up several programs of action for the attainment of general and complete disarmament.The response and reaction of the super-Powers have been in stark contrast to the urgency of the situation. To be sure  they make a lot of notion about negotiations. However  the international community cannot be blamed if it now sees these negotiations as no more than exercises in public relations. In some cases these efforts are even designed to buy more time to design and manufacture more dreadful weapons of mass destruction.Nuclear disarmament is a global issue in which all. states have a vital stake  It cannot and should not  therefore  be left exclusively the hands of the two super-Powers. The United Nations  representing the peoples of the world  should keep up the pressure to bring ^bout a halt to the nuclear arms race and to proceed to nuclear disarmament. The very survival of all our countries and all our peoples is at stake.Another major threat to international peace and security that has defied United Nations efforts is apartheid  that iniquitous practice which has rightly been termed a crime against humanity. The danger inherent in the practice was first brought to the attention of the United Nations General Assembly at its third session. Since then apartheid has thrived on the support of certain powerful Members of this Organization whose concern for high returns on investments in South Africa outweighs their global responsibility. By a series of oppressive laws and the naked practice of State terrorism  successive regimes in apartheid South Africa have violated every conceivable law of human decency. In the process also the Pretoria clique has constituted itself into a veritable menace to the neighboring States  disturbing the peace and security of the entire southern African region. My Government has condemned in no uncertain terms the latest violation of the territorial integrity of Angola by South Africa. Nigeria pledges its unflinching support to those sister African States that are victims of the racist regime.As if to emphasize their disgust at the failure of the United Nations to take effective action against apartheid  the people of South Africa have decided to make whatever sacrifice is required to liquidate apartheid. As a result of the spontaneous uprising of the past few months  it now appears that the count-down to the collapse of apartheid has at least started. Oppression by the white rulers has reached the point where it has forced all segments of the oppressed to rebel.This is not the first time that blacks have reacted to their subjugation. What is different is the evident determination  even in the face of panic emergency measures  to press on. It is significant that the trigger-point to the current wave of mass action was the so-called constitutional reform whereby the apartheid regime thought it could perpetuate its oppression by granting some meaningless concessions to the Coloreds and the Asians. Characteristically  the apartheid regime thought it could  without reaction  continue to ignore the 21 million blacks. That was its crowning folly  for it totally misjudged the mood of the black people of South Africa.The mass revolt which has involved workers  students  even school children  and the clergy  has caught the apartheid regime off guard. Its response  again true to character  was to introduce more draconian laws in the form of declaring a state of emergency. Two points should now be clear to the apologists for the apartheid regime: first  that the racist regime is in no mood to seek a peaceful accommodation with the majority blacks for a framework for the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa based on equality of all races. Mr. Botha's long awaited speech of 15 August 1985 gave not the slightest indication of a disposition towards meaningful change. Those States Members of the United Nations  which rather than support effective action against the apartheid regime delude themselves about possible persuasion of the regime  should by now see that they are mistaken. The ruling clique in Pretoria will not give up except as the result of concerted pressure of international action in support of the internal revolt of South Africans.Secondly  the continuous mass actions of the black Africans  despite brutal police and military killings  should by now have convinced outsiders that no sacrifice is considered too great to make for their liberty and human dignity. It is especially important to emphasize this point since unwillingness to support effective economic sanctions against South Africa is often camouflaged by the spurious argument of its effects on black South Africans and on neighboring countries. The present economic system in South Africa is based on the deprivation of blacks and the exploitation of their labor. It is one of the pillars of the apartheid system. To dismantle apartheid  a change in the system is inevitable. Let those who oppose sanctions but protest their abhorrence of apartheid know that they are guilty of double-talk.On this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations let us resolve to bring hope to the oppressed South Africans. Let the Security Council meet and impose mandatory economic sanctions on South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter. Let all the permanent members of the Security Council support sanctions in discharging the onerous responsibility bestowed on them by the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. Let all Members of the United Nations give total support for sanctions  bearing in mind that the alternative will be a bloodbath of unspeakable proportions. Today I call upon the principal trading partners of South Africa to co-operate and assist the process of genuine change in South Africa that may still be achieved without mass bloodshed.Nineteen years ago on 27 October 1966 the General Assembly  under resolution 2145 (XI)  terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia and assumed direct responsibility over the Territory. Since then the United Nations  through the General Assembly and the Security Council  has adopted numerous resolutions and decisions all aimed at finding a peaceful  just and acceptable solution of the Namibian question. The landmark of these efforts was the adoption by the Security Council in 1978 of resolution 435 (1978) which embodied a plan for the independence of Namibia.Despite all the efforts of the United Nations  the question of Namibia remains unresolved and the racist Pretoria regime continues to occupy Namibia illegally and to exploit its human and natural resources in contravention of Decree No. 1 enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia. Unfortunately  South Africa has been able to count on the support of a powerful Member of this Organization in its continued defiance of the United Nations over Namibia. By linking Namibia's independence to the withdrawal of Cuban defensive forces in Angola  South Africa has been provided with a cover with which to perpetuate its atrocities in Namibia.Insistence on extraneous and irrelevant issues as a precondition for the independence of Namibia is totally unacceptable to my Government. Namibia to us is a classic case of colonialism that must be resolved as such. It should not become a victim of the ideological rivalry of the super-Powers. The South African presence in Namibia must be seen for what it is. It is an illegal occupation by a latter-day imperialist Power that seeks every excuse to perpetuate its illegality and deny the Namibian people their right to self-determination. South Africa must be compelled to co-operate with the United Nations in implementing resolution 435 (1978).Another area where the United Nations has failed to achieve a solution is the Middle East. It is a problem as old as the United Nations itself. Yet we appear to be no nearer to a solution today than we were in previous years just because some of those involved do not face the realities of the situation. Hew can the Palestinians be ignored if there is to be a viable solution? Just as the security of all States in the region is an indispensable element in a durable solution  so also should be the recognition of the inalienable rights of all people in the region. That includes the Palestinians. A solution that is just  fair and equitable will have to recognize  inter alia  the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination. An international conference cm the Middle East is widely considered as the most appropriate forum for such a negotiated solution. Nigeria appeals to those countries which continue to oppose such a conference to reconsider their position. If the present stalemate is to be broken  all concerned should appreciate that unilateral measures are no substitute for the collective wisdom of the United Nations.Other trouble spots abound to remind us of the danger posed to peace and security in various parts of the world in this fortieth year of the United Nations. Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Central America  for instance  are sad reminders of unacceptable big Power intervention and interference in the affairs of small neighbors. This is an appropriate juncture in the annals of the United Nations to call for strict adherence to the principle of sovereign equality of States and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State  big or small. Nigeria therefore reiterates its support for the efforts aimed at establishing in Afghanistan and Kampuchea a stable and durable peace based on the withdrawal of all foreign forces and strict respect for the right of the peoples of those two countries to choose through free elections their Governments and re-establish firmly their non-aligned status.As for Central America  it behooves us all to support the efforts of the countries of Latin America to find a solution to problems in the subregion. All acts of aggression  overt or covert  must cease. All forms of economic sabotage directed against any country must end. The Contadora Group must be encouraged to pursue its initiative  which represents an important step towards lasting peace. We therefore urge the Governments of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua to show the political will to conclude negotiations on the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.At a time when the increasing Interdependence of countries calls for greater co-operation between them in the spirit and framework of the Charter that was adopted 40 years ago at San Francisco  we are instead witnessing the painful abandonment of those noble and worthy goals of the United Nations. We are witnessing a steady erosion of confidence in the multilateral system created in the post-war period. Further  we are witnessing a relentless attack on the United Nations system  which is at the center of existing multilateral arrangements. Today the role of the United Nations in providing a universal forum for economic problems facing the international community is continuously disrupted  bypassed and even ignored. Indeed  it has become more apparent than ever before that the United Nations system is the focus of the current challenge to multilateralism. Violations  often flagrant  of- the principles and norms which underpin the multilateral system have helped to weaken its ability to provide a viable framework for international economic co-operation for development  as envisaged by the Charter.A concomitant feature of the decline in multilateralism has been the marked resurgence of unilateral approaches to economic problems that have global ramifications. What is of the utmost concern to my delegation is the adverse impact on the developing countries of the unilateral decisions and acts of the powerful actors in the global economy. Such actions  by definition  are bound to be arbitrary and extremely self-serving. It is therefore not surprising in the least that they tend to violate basic economic agreements and concepts which they themselves have invested with the cloak of sacred economic doctrine and international law. Some of these unilateral actions include high interest rates  volatile exchange rates  protectionism  measures that result in deteriorating terms of trade for the developing countries  and refusal to vies with sympathy the external debts of developing countries which have resulted in the net export of capital to the developed countries.All those factors are symptomatic of a dangerous movement towards a new de facto multilateral economic framework quite incapable of dealing with the great global economic problems of our time  both in their medium-term and long-term prospects  we reiterate that global problems  be they in the areas of trade  commodities  money and finance  or debt  demand global solutions. To achieve this goal we must effectively employ the mechanisms and instruments that are available to the international community  namely  the institutions of the United Nations system. We must go back to the true spirit of the Charter of the United Nations in ensuring and sustaining vibrant multilateral economic co-operation. Nigeria believes that the occasion of this fortieth anniversary of our Organization is an appropriate time for the renewal of and rededication to the multilateral spirit.In reaffirming our commitment to the multilateral approach  Nigeria calls for the resumption of an honest and serious North-South dialog on issues of international economic co-operation for development. During the last decade we witnessed  with profound regret  many missed opportunities resulting in the lack of significant progress in all sectors. Clearly there is an urgent need to create  nurture and sustain a favorable climate of genuine dialog and consensus. There is a need to allay unfounded fears of each other's intentions. We believe that flexibility in our various positions  coupled with the necessary political will  is required to permit the restructuring of the world economy in a mutually advantageous manner  as called for in the new international economic order. Global negotiations  stalled as a result of one ruse after another for the past five years  in spite of the sincerity demonstrated by the Group of 77  must be launched immediately.The world economic situation continues to be fragile even though we are in the third year of the recovery. It is new generally agreed that the recovery  which at best remains uneven and unbalanced  has failed to have any visible positive effects on world trade and the economies of the developing countries  thus proving beyond any doubt the ineptness of the trickle-down theory. There are uncertainties about the immediate prospects as protectionist pressures and attitudes in the major industrialized countries refuse to abate  giving rise to policies which can only further choke the feeble growth signals in the developing countries. We are therefore concerned about the adverse effects of the general macro-economic policies of the major industrialized countries on the economies of the developing countries. It is obvious to all that there is no effective surveillance over the major industrialized countries whose policies have the greatest impact on the international economy and whose unilateral actions and policies continue to destabilize the multilateral regime. We must realize that a world where the many are poor and the few are rich is a world of iniquity; it is a recipe for instability. So let us together examine seriously ways and means of bringing about prosperity  not for a few  but for all. Let us re-examine the international financial institutions with the purpose of making them purveyors of prosperity rather than economic and political ruin.The burden of debt which has become unbearable in financial terms for many developing countries need not be further compounded by social and political upheavals. How can a developing country like mine spend about 45 per cent of its export earnings on debt servicing and still be expected to satisfy the basic needs of its teeming population as well as achieve sustained economic growth? Our creditors must realize that it is in their interest as well as ours that we survive.Let me now turn to the special challenge which the critical economic situation in Africa poses for the conscience of mankind and the international community. By adopting a Declaration on the situation at its thirty-ninth session  this Assembly recognized the gravity of the terrible tragedy that was unfolding on the continent and the need for the whole world to stand up as one to combat the situation. One year has elapsed and we cannot pay enough tribute to the tremendous response by the international community to the relief aspect of the crisis. The overwhelmingly sympathetic and active public opinion in the donor countries not only attests to the brotherhood of man but has also helped to keep interest in the situation alive and to permit sustained  action by their home Governments. The generosity of which the human spirit is capable when aroused is a welcome testimony to the goodness that mankind is capable of. A great amount of food aid and allied requisites were provided and  without question  numerous lives were saved. We applaud the manifest international goodwill which this relief assistance has exemplified and hope that this will be intensified in the future as the situation in many African countries still remains critical and life-threatening under the specter of starvation and hunger. Indeed  at the present time  emergency requirements of over $1.5 billion for 1985 are still unmet for the 18 most seriously affected countries.While on the whole the donor response to the emergency dimensions of the crisis has been commendable  it is much to be regretted that very little  if any  effort has been directed towards the longer-term and structural problems of the African economy  we view with enormous concern the reluctance of the international community to deal with the fundamental problems of economic development faced by African countries. As the Nigerian delegation pointed out at the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council  in July  when this item came before the Council for the second year in a row as its priority item  it is precisely in the vital area of long-term measures that the response of the international community and the United Nations system has been the weakest. No serious and co-ordinated .effort has been made to interface the current global response to the emergency situation with the longer-term development needs of the African continent.We call for urgent action by the international community addressed specifically to such structural problems as food and agricultural production  drought and desertification  declining financial  particularly official development assistance  flows and  last but not least  the heavy external debts of the African region  we firmly believe that the rehabilitation and restoration of the process of growth and development is impossible in the absence of intensive and effective action on these major long-term problems faced by African countries. We call strongly for the adoption of a new development consensus by the international community on behalf of Africa to pave the way for this concerted global action. We believe that this is a call without equivocation and that it should be possible for donors to accept this challenge nobly and liberally in the same manner as they demonstrated in meeting the requirements of the emergency. We further believe that the capacity to do so exists. We therefore call for the necessary political will to make this possible. It should be clear  since there can bS.no mistake about this  that African countries accept that the primary responsibility for dealing with the critical economic situation and for relaunching the development process in the continent lies with them. The 21st session of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa in July and devoted mainly to the discussion of the critical economic situation of their region  demonstrated the commitment of Africa's leaders and peoples to the economic development and self-reliance of the continent. Accordingly  the summit meeting adopted both a Declaration and a far-reaching five-year priority program of action for the accelerated development of Africa. We commend this action program for the sustained support of the international community and in this light we welcome the positive tone of resolution 1985/80  on the critical economic situation in Africa  adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its second regular session. In addition  we wish to highlight the appeals made by the summit meeting for the convening of an international conference on Africa's debt and a special session of the General Assembly to discuss Africa's critical economic situation. We believe that these are extremely important calls from Africa which deserve the full support of the international community.I should like to state again that  in spite of its shortcomings  the existence of the United Nations in the past 40 years has made the world a better place than it was in the pre-United Nations years. But a lot more needs to be done. Confidence in the Organization has eroded; the Organization has been ignored and heavily criticized. Its effectiveness has consequently been sapped. We need to revitalize the Organization by rededicating ourselves to the ideals enshrined in the Charter  in particular by collectively demonstrating in a practical way the political will to act. We must restore confidence in the United Nations as the main framework for multilateral co-operation in the world. We must collectively revitalize the Organization and create a political atmosphere that will be conducive to the pursuit and realization of global peace and security  as well as the promotion of economic growth and development."
"90",5186,"NLD",40,1985,"A few days ago a Member state was plunged in sorrow by a major natural disaster. As the citizens of Mexico are mourning their dead our thoughts are with the bereaved families. Allow me to extend on behalf of the people of the Netherlands to the people of Mexico ray deep sympathy at this tragic event.The fortieth anniversary of this Organization  which we are to celebrate in a month's time  promises to be very busy and difficult for those responsible for the proper and orderly conduct of business. We are therefore particularly happy that a distinguished diplomat and an old hand at United Nations affairs will preside over our meetings* And he has represented in New York until recently a country which will shortly join us in our endeavors to build a new Europe.At an anniversary session like this  one is tempted to draw up a balance-sheet of past successes and failures of.our Organization. In this connection I was reminded of a conversation not too long ago between a French intellectual and a Chinese philosopher. The Frenchman asked what he thought of the French revolution. The philosopher replied that he was not certain whether sufficient time had passed since then and that he therefore preferred not to jump to conclusions. To meat of us this may seem excessively cautious. We can  however  draw some hope from this observation  when we look back on 40 years of the United Nations  we see a picture of both successes and failures  of progress and lost opportunities.When we embarked upon this enterprise 40 years ago the immediate past was almost too horrible to contemplate. Consequently there seemed much to lode forward to. With the chaos and destruction of the Second World War behind us progress seemed somehow inevitable. The Charter of the united Nations bears witness to that mood. From now on nations would walk hand in hand. It was not to be.Soon it became apparent that the Charter's system of collective security had become frequently paralyzed  and it is sad to note that 40 years later this Organization has still to live up to its promise ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". The situation in Afghanistan is a case in point.Moreover  we sees to get confused by the growing number of world-wide problems that stubbornly resist solution. As a result  international institutions are quietly but irresistibly eroded by a process of slow-motion disintegration. Our Secretary-General did not relent from expressing in his annual reports his anxiety at the present trends  at the erosion of the authority and status of world and regional institutions and at the crisis in the multilateral approach to International affairs.As for this Organization  I continue to believe that it has the capacity and the resilience to do better than its predecessor  the League of Nations  which gradually receded to the background while history van its disastrous course. This Organization is better equipped to solve many of the major problems besetting the world than the League of Nations ever was. Surely  the crisis in the multilateral approach to international relations is not so much one of method as of will  the will to resort to the methods at our disposal and to use them properly. I submit that I am nob the only one who would wish the number of General Assembly resolutions to be radically reduced  if oily because their currency is heavily devaluated by inflation. Secondly  there is a clear need for restoring the process of real negotiations before draft resolutions are put to a vote. What ' matters is obviously not to win a majority somehow  in many cases all too easily  but to gather the support of those Member States that in practice bear the responsibility in a certain situation or have the means to carry out General Assembly recommendations. Thirdly  and in the same vein  we should not seek short-term advantages for political expediency but  on the contrary  we should aim at long-term progress in creating a more humane and peaceful world. Finally  once a truly negotiated decision has been taken  we should not step aside as if the subject matter were settled by the adoption of a resolution; instead we should realize that words hold true only if translated into action.A disturbing gap between oratory and practical results is to be found in the field of arms control and disarmament; for  whatever successes the United Nations may claim to have achieved in its 40 years of existence  it is a saddening truth that we  its Members  have failed so far to build a collective framework for the maintenance of international peace and security. If the present state of the world shows signs of incoherence and disintegration  this is certainly one of its root causes. The dream of peace is as vivid as when the United Nations was founded  but our peoples are at the same time anxiously aware that the level of armaments has reached a point higher than ever before.Easy solutions are not at hand  but at least we should avoid developments running out of control and try to abide by the agreements reached so far. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons is certainly not the end of thedebate on nuclear d is armament but it is an essential instrument in the security interest of all of us. The objective of nuclear disarmament  already mostdifficult to achieve  would be rather beyond reach if the number of nuclear Powers were to increase. It was  therefore  encouraging that the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons demonstrated  at their recently concluded Review Conference in Geneva  their continuing support for the Treaty. By adopting a final declaration by consensus  despite a wide range of differing views on disarmament  they have strengthened that Treaty's credibility and vitality.It goes without saying that the Soviet Union and the United States carry primary responsibility for curtailing the nuclear arms race* Equally it goes without saying that the peoples of the world look forward with expectation to the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of those two Powers. Our hope is that it may produce a new stimulus to the arras control negotiations at present under way in Geneva and that it will lead to an intensified dialog on effective agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth  at limiting and reducing nuclear arms and at strengthening strategic stability.Substantial reductions and preferably complete elimination of land-based intermediate-range missiles are of specific relevance to the Netherlands. On this matter my Government has taken a position of utmost restraint. In June 1984 we made a strong appeal to the Soviet union to reverse the trend of the ever-increasing build-up of 3S-20 missiles  in which case we would be prepared to forgo deployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles on our territory. Unfortunately  our participation in deployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles now seems to have become inevitable  since that appeal to the Soviet Union has remained unheeded. Nevertheless  for our part  together with our allies  we shall not cease to contribute to constructive and imaginative thinking on how an equitable  balanced and verifiable agreement can be attained in Geneva on this category of weapons.For years now the prohibition of chemical weapons has headed the agenda of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. In an unprecedented gesture the Conference has decided to extend its informal consultations on the subject while this Assembly is in session. The urgency of a comprehensive agreement is all the more apparent in view of recent violations of the Geneva Protocol banning the use of such weapons and the prospect that a growing number of countries might consider acquisition of chemical means of warfare.One of the most successful endeavors of the United Nations in the field of international peace and security are its peace-keeping operations and observer missions in a number of conflict areas. On the whole these operations have proved to be a useful instrument of deescalation and conflict control. We have learned from experience that these peace-keeping forces can hope to play a useful role only if they can count on the co-operation of the parties to a particular conflict. That is both their strength and their weakness  it is not the objective of a peacekeeping force to solve the problems that lead to a conflict. What they can do  however  is create a favorable climate  without which diplomatic efforts to solve the underlying dispute cannot hope to achieve much. Without a framework of peace-making by political means a peace-keeping force can by itself do little or nothing to rectify the situation.It is precisely with that in mind that I should like to draw this Assembly's attention to the situation of the united Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). it operates in a political vacuum created by the inability of the parties involved to reach agreement on security arrangements in the area and to cone to an understanding of the role of the Force in southern Lebanon. Regrettably  the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Lebanon has so far not led to a situation in which UNIFIL can fulfill a role more in keeping with its mandate. As a consequence both of the precarious situation prevailing in Lebanon and of Israel's insistence on the preservation of a security zone beyond its own border  UNIFIL's main concern now seems to be to protect its own personnel. However unsatisfactory as the present state of affairs may be  my Government continues to be grateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for their unrelenting efforts to redress the situation. Should success continue to elude then  however  it is to be feared that UNIFIL's position will become rapidly untenable.The Secretary-General in his recent report has made the wise observation that the United Nations cannot - and was not intended to - solve all the problems of the international community but that it is the best place to avoid the worst and to strive for improvement. For this reason  I would like to add  this Organization deserves all the political support its Members can give. I have already mentioned its peace-keeping efforts.Another field in which we should muster our forces relates to the plague of terrorism and hijacking. This form of anarchy can be collaborated only in conditions of international solidarity and mutual co-operation.Whatever motives might lead to terrorist behavior  it remains an offense against every norm of civilization to take hostage innocent persons  let alone to kill them almost wantonly. I. would join the appeal to those countries not yet parties to the Conventions adopted under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation organization (ICAO) on aviation security and to the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages  adopted by the General Assembly  to do so speedily. Likewise  I urge all parties to these Conventions to implement them scrupulously under all circumstances.International co-operation in the economic and social fields has been an essential task of the united Nations in pursuit of the purposes and principles of the Charter for a better world. Over the last four decades the United Nations  with its system of specialized agencies  has made an important contribution. For millions of people  particularly in developing countries  the United Nations has been synonymous with change and with hope for the future. In the areas of international co-operation for development  environment;  population and  most recently  the status of women  this Organization  through a variety of activities  has earned its place in history. The Netherlands is proud to have been closely associated with these activities and will continue to be associated with them in the years ahead.The world economy today is characterized by complex interrelationships of financial  monetary and trade issues which - as the Secretary-General has pointed out in his annual report - ""are of such profound political and social importance that they can only be dealt with effectively as part of a wider political process"" (A/40/1  p. 9). In this respect the United Nations offers a universal and unique forum for discussion and study that cuts across traditional sectoral boundaries. Co-ordinating efforts  such as the recent examples of addressing the emergencies on the African continent  have shown that  given the will of all concerned  the United Nations can make an important contribution.The United Nations has been instrumental in formulating objectives and targets for development co-operation. These continue to play a vital role in our determination of priorities. Only last week the Netherlands Government reaffirmed its own effort  amounting to 1.5 per cent of our net national income for development co-operation purposes. I would like to join those who appeal to other industrialized countries to bring their development effort in line with the internationally agreed target of 1 per cent.International solidarity is also the sole answer to the world-wide problem of refugees. We note with considerable concern the unprecedented increase in the number of refugees and other displaced persons over the past several years. In many regions the vicious circle of armed conflict  violations of human rights and social disintegration leads to a disruption of the fabric of society. As a consequence  people are uprooted and this in turn leads to more flows of refugees. At present the High Commissioner faces the challenge of finding durable solutions to an ever-growing refugee problem  a problem compounded by the emergency situation in Africa. Now  as at the time when this high office was created  my Government will continue to lend its active support to the promotion of international co-operation with a view to providing material assistance wherr such assistance is required. We will also continue to support the High Commissioner in his efforts to integrate assistance projects for refugees in United Nations development projects.According to his mandate it is the High Commissioner's first duty to give international protection to refugees. Over the years it has become increasingly difficult to carry out this delicate task. The continued occurrence of threats and violations of the safety of those who seek asylum and refugees  including armed attack against refugee camps and settlements  is particularly disquieting.The disorder and confusion we often see in relations between States we can find many times repeated on the level of relations between Governments and subjects and between individual people. As the Charter of the United Nations should provide the framework for orderly international relations  so the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Covenants and Conventions that grew out of it provide an international code for how the State must treat individuals.We are all aware of the widely differing views on human rights which find expression in these halls. It is therefore all the more encouraging that at times we cure able to add meaningful agreements to the already existing ones governing relations between Governments and individuals  we  for our part  shall continue to exploit whatever opportunity may present itself to further the cause of human rights.This jubilee session of the General Assembly is a fitting occasion to add to the body of international human rights law. It is hoped that the Sixth Committee will draw inspiration from the speedy work of last year's session concerning the Convention on torture and finish its work on the draft body of principles for the protection of all persons under any form of detention or imprisonment  one of the functions of this instrument will be to provide further protection against the evil of torture.In recent years we have seen once again how closely intertwined are the concept and practice of pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights. Freedom of thought  conscience and religion  freedom of opinion and expression and other fundamental human rights are prerequisites for meaningful popular participation in all aspects of social life. A recent example is the return of several Latin American countries to pluralistic democracy  a development which vent hand in hand with the restoration of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.However  the struggle for democracy remains a difficult one. In too many States totalitarian or authoritarian government continues to be the rule. To' many leaders  the test of free and meaningful elections seems a thing too dangerous to contemplate. For how else could one explain the open and veiled threats  coercion  harassment  imprisonment and worse which befall those who have the courage to stand up for their rights? Yet these practices occur in many States which have solemnly committed themselves to respect those rights. Sad as this may be  we should insist on the full implementation of these commitments  as the signatories of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe did only two months ago in Helsinki at the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the signature of that document.The denial of basic human rights to the majority of the population of South Africa  aggravated by a constitutional system of racial discrimination  has brought that country to the brink of disintegration and chaos. Its Government had to resort to the proclamation of a state of emergency in large parts of the country. Despite legitimate demands for change in the past both from within South Africa itself and from the international community  the South African Government has so far remained unwilling to initiate a national dialog and to implement basic reforms aimed at the abolition of apartheid. In our view  the only hope for peaceful change in South Africa is such a broadly based national dialog. In our view a set of confidence-building measures by the South African Government is essential to promote the possibilities for that national dialog. We note that certain steps have been taken to dissolve some components of the apartheid system  but there can be no such thing as a good and a bad apartheid. The system should be abolished in its totality.It is peaceful change in south Africa that we are striving for. We do not want to promote civil strife nor do we condone violence  from whatever quarter. A total isolation of South Africa  as often advocated  will in my view only strengthen the hand of the champions of apartheid and thus tend to be counterproductive. What we do need is a gradual build-up of pressure by selective measures  supported by as many countries as possible. For that reason my Government remains in favor of action by the Security Council. For their part the Ten members of the European Community  together with Spain and Portugal  have made significant progress in harmonizing their attitudes on a number of restrictive measures. While exerting pressure on the South African Government we need also to give all support to the forces in South Africa working for a non-racial and peaceful society. Even at this late hour we must not lose hope that at the end reason and humanity will prevail.While this session is a kind of milestone on a road that started in 1945 it is fitting to remind ourselves of one of the concepts fundamental to this Organization  to wit its universality. We have a duty to admit into our ranks those countries that are willing to accept the Charter's obligations  like the Republic of Korea. We also have to respect the rules of the Charter if voices are raised to expel one of the present Members or to curtail its rights of membership. The very future of our Organization would be put in jeopardy if we  the Members of the united Nations  were to undermine the Charter  we all  nations large and small  need the United Nations in our fight against the centrifugal forces that tend to disrupt world society. What we need is genuine international co-operation so as to make true this anniversary's motto  ""united Nations for a better world""."
"91",5231,"NOR",40,1985,"Let me begin by expressing the deep sympathy we allfeel with the people of Mexico following the serious earthquakes that struck theircountry and their capital last week. The tragic and widespread consequences  lossof life  human suffering and material damage have made the deepest impactworld-wide. The international community stands ready to help the Mexican people inthe enormous tasks that now lie ahead. Let me also join the previous speakers whohave congratulated you  Sir  on your election to the very important office ofPresident of this session of the General Assembly  i feel confident that your wiseand firm leadership will contribute greatly to the successful outcome of our work this autumn.The fortieth anniversary of the united Nations calls for reflection and assessment of the future role of the Organization.- In his report the Secretary-General says:""He must be realistic about our difficulties and the dangers that we face. But let us also resolve to find the ways by which  together  we can surmount them."" (A/40/1  p. 16)Norway fully concurs with the Secretary-General in his call for such a constructive and forward-looking approach. But  unfortunately  the realities today do not always correspond with the aims and objectives of the United Nations Charter. Too often we see a lack of the political will to assume collective responsibility and to respect and abide by the decisions taken. Political rhetoric and verbal condemnations have often replaced efforts and taken time for the work of seeking realistic and constructive solutions. This is harmful to the reputation of the United Nations and  even more important  it is contrary to the long-term interests of Member States. We urgently need to alter this. Meraber states must face up to this challenge realistically and reaffirm their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter  not only in words but  above all  in deeds.The challenges we are facing today  grave conflicts the resolution of which requires concerted international action  explain why a strengthening of the united Nations is so important. Let me comment on some of the more pressing problems with which the Organization is faced.In south Africa the situation is explosive. Opposition to apartheid is growing every day. Apartheid represents a serious violation of basic human rights as laid down in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Apartheid also constitutes a serious threat to peace and stability in southern Africa.The response of the South African Government to the legitimate demands for meaningful political participation by the non-white majority has been disappointing  to say the least. One should have no illusions that the recent attempts at reforming the apartheid system will bring any fundamental changes in the system as such. They are mostly directed towards maintaining it in another form.In July this year the South African Government declared a state of emergency  detaining hundreds of political opponents and using violent means to suppress all political manifestation. These acts of oppression must be strongly condemned.The Norwegian Government firmly believes that effective international pressure must be brought to bear on the South African Government to put an end to apartheid by peaceful means. Norway has therefore repeatedly advocated that the United Nations Security Council adopt mandatory and comprehensive economic sanctions against South Africa.In the absence of this  Norway and the other Nordic countries have adopted a number of unilateral measures in order to increase the pressure on south Africa to abolish apartheid. In 1978 the Nordic countries adopted a program of action for this purpose  and in March this year Norway took the initiative in reviewing and extending this program. The result of this will be that the Nordic Foreign Ministers will finalize an extended Nordic program of action at their meeting in Oslo next month.In addition to these Nordic measures  last March the Norwegian Government presented a national plan of action in order further to reduce Norway's trade and other economic relations with South Africa. This plan has already resulted in substantially reduced imports of any commodities from south Africa.In the present situation even limited sanctions may have an important psychological effect on the South African Government by making it clear that the apartheid system is unacceptable to the world community. In recent months many countries have introduced various such measures. In July the Security Council  in its resolution 569 (19S5)  recommended that member States adopt a number of voluntary measures against South Africa. Norway welcomes these developments and urges other countries to implement similar measures. However  mandatory sanctions by the Security Council are still our primary request. Words of condensation of apartheid are not enough.Norway also appeals urgently to the South African Government to lift the state of emergency  to release all political prisoners and to start a dialog with the genuine leaders of the black population with the aim of abolishing apartheid and introducing equal rights for all population groups.The question of Namibia also constitutes a major challenge to the United Nations. My Government continues to believe that every effort must be made to achieve a negotiated settlement of the Namibian conflict in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We have noted in this respect the efforts made by the Secretary-General and by the United States and would encourage them to continue their endeavors. The independence of Namibia is long overdue.The Middle East continues to be one of the most serious areas of conflict in the world. Lebanon remains in turmoil. There is no foreseeable end to the tragic armed conflict between Iraq and Iran with its meaningless loss of life and endless human suffering.The Arab-Israeli conflict is still an unresolved issue  we have  however  witnessed some positive developments. The peace initiatives taken by King Hussein of Jordan and President Mubarak of Egypt are steps forward in the search for a settlement. It is our impression that the cautious Israeli response enhances this prospect of renewing the peace process.Peace and security in the Middle East can ultimately be achieved only through a negotiated settlement that takes due account of the interests of all the parties concerned. Such a settlement must be based on the united Nations Charter and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and negotiations should take place directly between the parties concerned.Peace-keeping operations constitute one of the most important and successful tools of the United Nations in its efforts to maintain international peace and security.The situation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) illustrates  however  the great difficulties that a peace-keeping force may encounter. UNIFIL is still  in a position to fulfill its mandate. In spite of the difficult circumstances in which the Force has operated over the years  UNIFIL's presence has symbolized the will of the international community to restore peace and security and to re-establish Lebanese authority in the area in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council.As a major troop-contributing country  Norway is concerned about the present unsatisfactory situation for the Force. It is of particular importance that UNIFIL be given a realistic opportunity to perform the tasks it has been assigned. UNIFIL should be allowed to deploy its troops down to the international border. The parties involved must genuinely co-operate with UNIFIL in discharging its mandate. The security of the forces must not be unduly jeopardized. Responsibility for that rests primarily with the parties; but the Security Council also has an obligation to see to it that the Force's mandate can be implemented in accordance with the Council's own decisions.Before the present mandate expires in mid-October  careful consideration must be given to all aspects of UNIFIL*s presence in southern Lebanon.In Asia also we are faced with serious conflicts with widespread international consequences. The Soviet Union's military intervention in Afghanistan not only causes great suffering and losses for the Afghan people and increases tension in the region  but it is also me of the major issues preventing normalization between the East and the West. In spite of the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General  the Afghan problem remains unresolved. The core of the problem is the unwillingness of the Soviet Union to consider in a serious way the question of troop withdrawal. We urge the Soviet Union to reconsider its position. A solution would significantly improve international relations.In Kampuchea we are confronted with a similar situation. Kampuchea has been occupied for nearly seven years by Vietnamese forces. The occupying Power shows no concrete willingness to contribute to a lasting and peaceful solution as drawn up by the General Assembly: first  the total withdrawal of all foreign troops and  secondly  the right of the Kampuchean people freely to choose their own government.In Central America  the persistent efforts of the Contadora countries offer the best hope for resolving problems in the area. The aim is to lessen the military tension and build confidence among the neighboring countries. Durable solutions can best be sought by the countries of the region themselves. In the opinion of sty Government  it is of particular importance to prevent outside interference. But other nations should render economic support and co-operation and encourage political and social reforms as a basis for a truly democratic and peaceful development.Disarmament has remained a central and important concern of our world Organization over the years. The challenge is especially urgent in the field of nuclear weapons. It is highly significant therefore - and it must be welcomed -that the United States and the Soviet Union have resumed their talks in Geneva. Norway fully supports those negotiations as a means of obtaining substantial reductions in the number of nuclear arms and in securing the removal of the most destabilizing nuclear-weapon systems.It is equally important to prevent an arms race in outer space.It is our hope that the Geneva talks will result in agreements covering reductions and limitations of offensive and defensive weapon systems.The maintenance of the non-proliferation regime is of vital importance for international peace and security. During the Third Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that aspect was strongly emphasized. Moreover  the Review Conference has demonstrated the urgent need for further measures to halt the nuclear-arms buildup and to begin nuclear disarmament.We should continue to take concrete measures also within the United Nations framework to create a favorable climate for new progress in disarmament. Our task must clearly be to broaden the areas of agreement and put the collective weight of the Member states behind our recommendations. in this way our Organization will be able to make significant contributions to our efforts in search of security at a substantially lower level of armament. Similarly  the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament should be expedited; in particular  it would be of special importance to move forward on a comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests.For our part  we have also stated that we would be ready to support proposals to create a basis for an agreed  balanced and verifiable freeze on nuclear arms in the context of negotiations on substantial reductions.Although substantial and balanced reductions in nuclear weapon are of primary importance  it is also vital to achieve progress in the field of conventional disarmament. We believe that a verified  lower level of forces in Europe  as a result of the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions  would be an important contribution to stability in that region. It would also be conducive to building confidence in East-West relations. The Stockholm Conference on Disarmament in Europe has taken up this particular task. Norway considers it most important that the confidence-building measures laid down in the Final Act of Helsinki be developed further.The commemoration this summer of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki reminded us that many expectations relating to the process of security and co-operation in Europe have not been met. However  through persistent efforts and by taking small steps at a time it should be possible to reduce mutual suspicion and insecurity and break down the barriers between East and West in EuropeWe regret that agreement on a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons has not been readied despite painstaking efforts in the Conference on Disarmament. The elimination of all chemical weapons from existing arsenals must be our aim. It is a matter of the utmost concern that such abhorrent weapons have been used in recent years and that they continue to be considered as militarily useful. Both the buildup and the spread of such weapons should be halted and a process of reduction should be started.International stability depends to a great extent upon our ability to secure a balanced development in all parts of the world. If we succeed in reducing the present levels of armament - as we must - some of the resources released in this process should be used for the benefit of the poorer nations. For those reasons Norway puts great emphasis on and will take an active part in next year's International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.The recently concluded World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for women succeeded in adopting by consensus a forward-looking strategy. This is a highly satisfactory result. After 10 years of struggle and confrontation  the Conference was able to affirm a global commitment to seek long-term changes in order to eliminate discrimination against women. We have thereby been provided with an important set of propositions that will guide our renewed efforts to help women to move into the social and economic mainstream of their societies.The General Assembly should at this session take steps to ensure that the many recommendations are systematically followed up and monitored by the United Nations. Norway intends to participate actively in the .deliberations at this session of the General Assembly in order to arrive at a comprehensive approach within the United Nations to issues related to women.The United Nations has over the past 40 years made substantive advances in elaborating international human rights standards. The Covenants and Conventions that grew out of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights constitute the basis for promoting equal and fundamental rights for people in all parts of the world. Specific mechanisms have also been established by the United Nations to monitor compliance with these agreements. Although the existing international instruments are fairly comprehensive  improvements can and should be made. Norway supports these efforts of the United Nations and stands ready to participate actively and constructively in this field.In spite of present international rules and regulations  violations of human rights continue to take place to an alarming extent. In many parts of the world  discrimination  arbitrary executions  torture and denial of basic political and civil rights seem to be the rule rather than the exception. The most pressing challenge facing us today in the field of human rights is the practical implementation of agreed standards. This obligation rests primarily with the Governments themselves within their area of responsibility. The international community  however  in particular through the relevant organs of the United Nations  has a responsibility to oppose and as far as possible prevent violations wherever they occur. This international responsibility roust be exerted in a non-discriminatory way irrespective of.where the violation takes place. The application of basic human rights standards must be truly universal.A priority task must therefore be to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to deal with human rights violations. The establishment of a position such as the united Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights will in our opinion be a useful instrument to this end.The refugee problem is also a joint responsibility of the international community. It is important that we all contribute to its solution. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees plays a key role in the efforts to alleviate the plight of refugees  in providing humanitarian assistance and protection and in finding countries for resettlement.International humanitarian work  and in particular assistance to refugees  is an important element and has a long tradition in Norway's foreign policy. This policy will be continued and we will do our utmost to strengthen and support the activities of the High Commissioner.The United Nations is aptly described as a corner-stone in Norway's foreign policy. To enhance the role of the Organization is an important task for the Norwegian Government. Our aim is an organization that is effective and vigorous  that serves the needs of Member States and that plays a central role in the maintenance of international peace and security  in the promotion of economic and social development and in the protection of fundamental human rights. Only if our Organization can truly be said to be ""a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends""  as formulated in the Charter  will we be able to build a more peaceful  stable and just world."
"92",5277,"NPL",40,1985,"I have the honor to convey to you. Sir  and to the representatives present here the greetings of my Sovereign  His Majesty Ring BireneiEa Bir Bikram Shah Dev  and also his best wishes for the success of the current session of the General Assembly.I wish to extend to you  Sir  the warm and sincere felicitations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. We are very happy to see a man of your eminence and skill guiding the work of this important session. My delegation feels confident that under your wise leadership the deliberations of this session  which coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  will be memorable.My delegation also wishes to place on record its deep appreciation to Mr. Paul Lusaka  who guided the previous session of the General Assembly with great dedication and distinction.It is with great pleasure that I pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his efforts and objectivity in promoting the cause of peace  concord and co-operation in these challenging and fast-changing times.May I also take this opportunity to express the profound sympathy and sincere condolences of His Majesty's Government and the people of Nepal to the friendly Government and people of Mexico over the heavy losses caused by the recent earthquakes.As 1985 marks the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  this session offers us a timely opportunity to take stock of the United Nations achievements and also to reflect over its less than satisfactory record in a number of vital areas of international relations.With its near universality of membership  the United Nations General Assembly has become the parliament of nations where the full and rich social  cultural and political panoply of the world is reflected. In this imperfect world where justice is often frustrated  a just cause can always find a voice in the United Nations  as is effectively underlined in the joyous celebration this year of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.It has been estimated that since the birth of the United Nations in 1945  there have been over 150 local and regional conflicts. Such conflicts have wrought consequences of truly tragic proportions  in terms both of loss of human life and material damage. In the same time-span  however  mediation efforts and peacekeeping operations initiated by the United Nations have been instrumental in resolving  or containing  many international disputes in a number of sensitive areas of the world. A study done a few years ago in fact listed more than 100 instances where the world body was successful in preventing a war or halting a potential conflict. While the United Nations thus has every reason to be proud of its record of peacekeeping operations  its main strength  as the Secretary-General has so rightly pointed out  lies in the will of the international community which it symbolizes. Clearly  without the co-operation of the parties concerned and the necessary political will of the entire membership  peacekeeping operations cannot really get off the ground.The United Nations and its family of specialized agencies and affiliated bodies have achieved considerable success in a number of sectors  in particular those in the socio-economic and decolonization realms. Indeed  in the economic  social and humanitarian fields the achievements of the operational agencies of the United Nations have been particularly impressive. They have made valuable contributions towards the economic and social development of developing countries.International conferences  programs and declarations on basic issues  such as new and renewable sources of energy  science and technology  population  environment and the role of women in peace and development  have awakened global consciousness on those key issues. These quiet achievements of the United Nations  which are but rarely highlighted  have indeed greatly contributed to the fulfillment of the purposes of the Charter at the basic level of human endeavor. Its achievements in encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification have been substantial  and include authoritative definitions of fundamental human rights and freedom.These are just a few of the important achievements of the United Nations in the last 40 years. Unfortunately these successes have been overshadowed by the lack of progress in three fundamental issues of our times. I refer  first/ to the inability to evolve an effective system for the maintenance of international peace and security; secondly  to the failure to curb the escalating arms race; and thirdly  to the continued deadlock in the efforts to establish a just international economic order.The United Nations was established to save mankind from the scourge of war. The Organization arose out of the catastrophic destruction and upheaval of the Second World War. The traumas of war instilled an over-confidence in the capacity of the Organization to build a safe and durable world order. The vision then was to evolve a system for the maintenance of international peace and security based largely on an institution guaranteeing the peaceful settlement of disputes  the main source of insecurity among nations. Such a model regime of international law would institutionalize faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person  thereby promoting social progress and better standards of life for all in larger freedom.The United Nations is an association of States which have decided  in freeexercise of their sovereign will  to abide by and uphold the principles and purposes incorporated in the Charter. Co-operation between Member States  and especially between the permanent members of the Security Council who have been assigned special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  is the sine qua non for the success of the Organization. There are therefore obvious reasons why the development of a truly effective international order has been extremely difficult and so painfully slow to attain. At one end of the scale we have the great Powers  with their intricate and complex relationship  which are to a large extent prisoners of their mutual fears and suspicions. At the other  we have the majority of nations and peoples  afflicted by varying degrees of instability  economic weaknesses and social backwardness. While the dynamics of time has generated in these peoples aspirations for a better life  economic constraints  the inequities of the international economic order or their own infrastructural problems bind them to an economic system that is not conducive to the attainment of their aroused aspirations.*The Charter has assigned primary responsibility to the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Article 99 of the Charter has entrusted to the Secretary-General the responsibility of bringing to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and security. It is a tribute to the statesmanlike qualities of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations that they have on a number of occasions invoked Article 99 in carrying out their heavy responsibilities. Unfortunately  however  in practice the Council swings into action only when the crisis is imminent or has already occurred. In the last 40 years  the actions of the Council have largely been in the nature of reaction rather than prevention. Very often the permanent members of the Council differ in their perception of threats. Even when there is an apparent consensus on the issue before it  extraneous matters all too often block consensus. Resolutions of the Council are side-stepped with impunity and often debates concentrate on the mechanical trading of accusations and counter-accusations. An enduring commitment to the Charter provision that a threat to international peace and security from whatever source and in whatever region must override ideological or other considerations is necessary if the Council is to function in the manner envisaged by the United Nations founding fathers. In other words  the efforts of the united Nations are likely to prove abortive unless Member States themselves evolve working elements of a global civilization and order. This will  of course  require a corresponding growth in mutual trust and respect among nations.No visible progress was made during the past year in resolving some of the major issues that threaten the fragile structure of international peace and security. A ""no war  no peace"" situation continues to plague the Middle East. Nepal remains convinced that a just and lasting solution of the problem cannot be achieved unless the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is recognized in conjunction with the rights of all States in the region  including Israel's  to live in peace within secure and defined boundaries  free from threats or acts of force. Such a reciprocal step would presuppose withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied since 1967. Nepal stands ready to extend its support to any measure designed to lessen tension in the region and to facilitate a just and comprehensive solution to the festering problem of the Middle East.The tragic events in Lebanon are another source of serious concern. Nepal has been participating in the United Nations Intern Force in Lebanon (UN IF XL) and pledges its support to any move to restore legitimate Lebanese sovereignty over the whole of Lebanon and to honor its territorial integrity. However  unfortunate incidents involving UNIFIL personnel are jeopardizing the very concept and success of the United Nations peace-keeping operations there. Nepal appeals to all parties concerned to co-operate with UNIFIL in carrying out the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council.The situation in Afghanistan is still at a stand-still in spite of the repeated demand of the overwhelming majority of Member States for a withdrawal of foreign force^ and their appeal to respect the right of the Afghan people to self-determination. In this context  my delegation wishes to reiterate its full support for the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  to find a political settlement of the Afghan problem.There has been no progress either in securing withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea  a condition which must be fulfilled to enable the Kampuchean people to decide their own destiny. Nepal supports the recent initiatives of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the Kampuchean question.The tragic war between Iran and Iraq has caused massive casualties in human lives and enormous material damage. He reiterate our appeal to -both Iran and Iraq to cease hostilities and to seek a negotiated settlement of their dispute.The policy of apartheid of the minority racist regime of South Africa constitutes a negation of all norms of human decency as evidenced in Pretoria's latest orgy of violence and repression against black South Africans including women and children. Its blatant aggression against and attempts at destabilizingneighboring African countries deserve the strongest international censure. South Africa has persisted with the occupation of Namibia in total stubborn defiance of international public opinion and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Recent South African maneuvers  including those aimed at perpetuating its illegal presence in Namibia  have made it amply clear that only effective steps under Chapter VII of the Charter can force the racist regime to comply with the will of the international community.My delegation reiterates its strong support for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned character of Cyprus. We also support the efforts being exerted by the Secretary-General to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.The situation in Central America continues to be tense  with the already heated atmosphere charged with violence  fear or threat of destabilization by outside forces. Nepal reiterates its support for Security Council resolution 530 (1983) and endorses the efforts of the Contadora Group to find a peaceful settlement of the problem of safeguarding the sovereignty  independence and dignity of all nations in that region.We reiterate our conviction that the aspiration of the Korean people for national reunification must be fulfilled peacefully without outside interference.The item on measures to prevent terrorism was inscribed on the agenda of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly on the initiative of the then Secretary-General. The Assembly set up an Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism and the subject was discussed at subsequent sessions of the General Assembly. Terrorism has of late taken a particularly vicious form. It destroys innocent lives  causes great damage and traumas  leaves scars of deep distrust and uncertainty creating an atmosphere of suspicion and fear. This has inexorably led to a sequence of events culminating in great human tragedies. As this scourge of contemporary life contemptuously tramples underfoot fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person  my delegation urges the Assembly to take urgent measures to mobilize international co-operation effectively to prevent and combat terrorism.The Charter of the United Nations has set out the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples as one of its fundamental objectives. However  far from making any progress towards that lofty goal  it is presently faced with the challenge of a critical economic situation. The prolonged economic difficulties facing developing countries have seriously jeopardized the pace of their development for years to come. The sombre economic situation in Africa will be merely a symptom of the impending global catastrophe if present trends are allowed to continue unchecked. The adverse forces at work in the world economy call for strong  sustained and co-ordinated action by the international community to overcome the structural causes of the present difficulties. The continued deadlock in the North-South dialog has reinforced the imperative need for the political will to accept the full implications of the growing interdependence in the world economy and to take bold and imaginative steps to reverse the present trend. It is a matter of high urgency  because widespread poverty and restitution contain the seeds of a threat to international peace and security.The United Nations has played a crucial role in the evolution of the concept of international co-operation for development and in the development of multilateral co-operation. The operational activities of the United Nations system have made valuable contributions towards the socio-economic development of developing countries. In recent years  unfortunately  there has been a steady erosion in multilateralism. States have been unwilling to develop a global strategy to combat the effects of the present economic malaise. The United Nations has the capacity to support global intergovernmental consultations and negotiations and there is broad scope for further extending Its operational activities if Member States are prepared to use it with determination to find solutions to the problems in the international economic order.The Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries represents a firm commitment of the international community to help the least developed countries develop their infrastructure and to launch development programs on a sustained basis. However  the international effort to implement the Program in the first half of the 1980s has been disappointing  to put it mildly. He once again appeal to the international community to live up to its pledge to fulfill the objectives set out in the Program. Moreover  as a country facing additional handicaps in our developmental efforts due to our landlocked character  we also appeal for effective implementation of the special measures adopted by the United Nations in favor of landlocked developing countries.Nepal believes that increased co-operation among developing countries is an essential ingredient of international co-operation and development. The prolonged crisis in the international economic order has had a serious impact on the efforts of the countries of the South Asian Region to accelerate the pace of their development. The present trend threatens us with the prospect of a rapid increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty. The complexity and scope of the problems facing South Asia have led us to envisage and gradually implement a program of South Asian regional co-operation. The progress achieved thus far has made us optimistic about the viability of regional co-operation not only as an exercise in the direction of collective self-reliance but also as a means of meaningfully promoting mutual understanding  friendship and goodwill among the seven participating countries of South Asia.The ever-escalating arras race  especially the competition in nuclear weapons  has become one of the most disquieting challenges to the human race today. The resources consumed by the competition in accumulating weapons of destruction  whose potential for death and destruction is virtually limitless  stand out in stark contrast to the pressing socio-economic problems facing the nations of the world. Nepal welcomed the resumption earlier this year of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on nuclear arms control. Like other Members of this Organization  we look forward to an early and meaningful breakthrough in those negotiations.The past few years have been particularly frustrating for disarmament efforts. Contrary to early expectations  a comprehensive nuclear test ban has yet to become a reality. In fact  the failure of the nuclear-weapon states to provide any concrete example of a serious effort to ease the nuclear arms race is gradually eroding the efficacy of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. There does not seem to be much hope for an early and concrete outcome of the negotiations on prohibiting chemical weapons. Contrary to all efforts  disarmament in conventional forces and weapons is a distant objective. On top of all these  we are now confronted with the threat of the arms race spreading into outer space.There are issues which transcend narrow national interests for they are tied to the question of the very survival of the human race. While we welcome the United States-Soviet negotiations  we feel that it is imperative to utilize the maximum potential of both bilateral and multilateral negotiations in the context of arms control and disarmament. The Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament offers a multilateral forum for serious dialog and negotiations. It will indeed be unfortunate if this United Nations forum is not utilized except for public presentation of rigid positions and vocalization of tired rhetoric.Nepal shares the fervent hope that the year 1985 - the year of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations - will mark an era where goodwill replaces antagonism and distrust in international relations. In that hope  we welcome the proposed summit meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union in November this year. Such meetings are of fundamental importance and are beneficial to the cause of peace  in view of the great responsibility these countries bear for the maintenance of international peace and security. When relations between these Powers develop on the basis of mutual accommodation and co-operation  they exert a favorable influence on the overall international situation.I have outlined some of the preoccupations and perceptions of Nepal on issues facing the international community today. Our commitment to the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and our high regard for international justice and human values have led us to base our policy of non-alignment on the purposes of the United Nations. He look upon the United Nations as the guardian of the freedom  integrity and sovereignty of small nations. It is the only universal organization committed to the maintenance of international peace and promotion of international co-operation for the betterment of the entire human race. The harmony between our national policy  perception and vision and the values upheld by this Organization have led us to incorporate the principles underlying the Charter in our Constitution as guiding beacons of our state policy.Our faith in the United Nations and everything that it stands for flows from our national perception of the indivisibility of peace and development. As a least developed country  socio-economic development is naturally our highest priority. He are however fully aware that we can concentrate on tackling the developmentalchallenges facing us only in an atmosphere of undisturbed peace. Our preoccupation with peace also reflects our earnest desire and continuous efforts to maintain the best relations with all countries of the world. While working for the progress and prosperity of our country  we wish for the stability  progress and prosperity of all friendly countries. Our national values  tradition and perception of international events have led His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev to propose that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. Z take this opportunity to express our appreciation to all friendly countries that have so far extended support to our proposal.I warmly welcome the decision of thirteen South Pacific nations to declare the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.To conclude  Nepal will continue to support unreservedly the efforts to strengthen the United Nations and work together with all peace-loving nations to enhance the sphere of its activities and the degree of its effectiveness. A stronger organization does not justify apprehensions in any quarter  for it is through this world body today that small States can ensure their security and respect for their independence and territorial integrity  as well as promote their economic and social progress. It is also in this Organization that the true and long term interests of the great Powers lie. Such a commitment alone will make the United Nations what mankind intended it to be: an effective instrument for securing peace and progress  and not merely a spectator of hopeful signs of easing of tensions  brought about by bilateral initiatives and agreements. Nepal hopes that this fortieth session of the Assembly will be the session of transition from antagonism to world co-operation and will herald the dawn of a new era of positive human endeavor."
"93",5341,"NZL",40,1985,"I must begin by expressing the profound regret of the New Zealand people at the terrible earthquakes in Mexico. Our thoughts are with the people of Mexico. New Zealand is a country which is subject to earthquakes - we know the devastation they can cause.It is a privilege and a pleasure for me to address the Assembly over which Ambassador de Pinies presides. I first came to the United Nations as a student intern in the 1960s. By then Ambassador de Pinies had already been a prominent figure here for some years. It is entirely appropriate that he should now have been elected to the Assembly's highest office. I offer him my congratulations  and the full support of my delegation for his efforts to make this fortieth session a fruitful and memorable one.As we celebrate this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the thoughts of all of us must turn to reflect on the aspirations and objectives that were pursued with such energy and confidence when the Charter of this Organization was drawn up. For a New Zealand representative it is natural to remember with pride that our Prime Minister of the day  the Right Honorable Peter Fraser  contributed to this original process with statesmanlike vigor. Today especially I wish to recall and pay homage to the leading role he played in seeking to assert the rights of small countries to the maximum possible protection under the Charter against the vicissitudes of international life and in the aftermath of two World Wars.Now  forty years on  this is no less cogent a problem. My Government  by irony of fate  finds itself at this rostrum again concerned to see maintained  in difficult circumstances  the sovereign rights of a small state against the increasingly complex and sophisticated pressures that are generated from largercountries within the international community.It continues to be ray Government's apprehension that  forty years on  the atomic weapon has kept its malign pace along with the existence of the United Nations. No less than in 1945  the horrific atomic shadow still falls across allour proceedings.In saying that  I am not expressing a platitude. My point is that the continued development of this weapon over the lifetime of our organization has in fact succeeded in distorting the fabric of international life. In our own experience it conditions the sovereign freedoms we had thought in 1945 were once and for all assured to us. At the very least as policies of power are pursued it has impinged on standards or international morality and behavior.In such a political climate  it is natural that smaller countries may turn to the possibilities of collective self-help that the Charter of the United Nations encourages. It is indeed to the advantage of the United Nations that each country contributes the perspective of that part of the world in which it finds itself -the South Pacific - there has over recent years been a growing perception that great Power rivalries could start to extend to our region. The fact is  however  that the strategic circumstances of the South Pacific are not those of the northern hemisphere; nor has the South Pacific so far been an area of great-Power confrontation. It need never be; and our own security is best served by keeping it so.Against that background the countries in the region have acted. We have set in being the best practical measure of agreed arms control available to us to guard against the emplacement of nuclear weapons in our midst. As was announced earlier this year  the South Pacific Forum countries endorsed and opened for signature on 6 August  the anniversary of Hiroshima Day  a treaty establishing the world's second nuclear-weapon-free zone in a permanently inhabited area. This South Pacific nuclear free zone Treaty signals in no uncertain terms the deeply anti-nuclear sentiments of our peoples  and their desire to live in peace and independence and to run their own affairs in accordance with their own wishes.It is basic to their peace of mind that there should be no use  testing or stationing of nuclear explosives in the South Pacific  and that the activities of the South Pacific countries themselves should fully respect and fulfill the aims of such applicable international measures as the Non-Proliferation Treaty.To these ends  all parties to the South Pacific nuclear free zone Treaty undertake not to possess  manufacture or acquire nuclear explosive devices anywhere  nor allow them to be stationed on their territory. They also undertake to prevent the diversion of fissionable material to non-peaceful purposes  and not to dump radioactive waste at sea in the zone.Under the Treaty  South Pacific countries retain their unqualified sovereign rights to decide for themselves  consistently with their support for these objectives  their security rights  and such questions as the access to their ports and airfields by vessels and aircraft of their countries. The Treaty is not  therefore  some sort of disguised attempt to undermine existing military alliances. It is a determined effort to ensure that the South Pacific is not riven by the tensions which have overshadowed so many other parts of the world.To the South  the Zone borders the area of another and much older agreement -the Antarctic Treaty. We value that Treaty not just because of the nuclear-free and demilitarized zone it establishes for Antarctica but because for 25 years it has effectively guaranteed the stability of the region to the South of New Zealand. It remains the only possible guarantee that that region will continue to remain free from international rivalry and conflict.To the East  the new zone borders the area covered by the Treaty of Tlatelolco. The joining of the areas covered by that Treaty and the Antarctic Treaty with the vast area covered by the new Treaty means that a large part of the Southern hemisphere has declared its determination to be free of nuclear weapons. As my own Prime Minister said last year to this General Assembly:""This initiative represents  I believe  a major advance for the region. It would not  we know  spare us from the consequences of nuclear war but  when in place  it would significantly strengthen the existing measures  both global and regional  to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons."" (A/39/PV.7  p. 11) Now in 1985  with the Treaty concluded and awaiting in due course its entry into force  we see it as a fitting contribution to this anniversary of the United Nations that we are celebrating.I should add that the South Pacific Forum countries hope that the five nuclear States will  after consultation with them  sign the relevant Protocols to this Treaty. Thereby they would agree not to use  or threaten to use  nuclear explosive devices against any country or territory in the zone. They would also undertake not to test nuclear explosive devices there.In this anniversary year of the United Nations  it is painful to have to point out once again that one of the nuclear-weapon states continues to test nuclear explosives in the South Pacific  against the manifest and long-established wish of all the countries in the area that this activity should cease.These nuclear testing activities have this year led to a new turn of events in the region which  because of its gravity  I am bound to bring to your attention.Politically motivated offenses and terrorism have been virtually unknown in New Zealand in the past. But the scene has changed as a result of the incident in July 1985 in which the Greenpeace vessel ""Rainbow Warrior"" was sunk at its berth in Auckland  New Zealand  by a bomb attack which killed a crew member. The circumstances indicated international terrorism. It was well known that the vessel was intended to sail to French Polynesia to protest against the continuation of nuclear explosions at Mururoa Atoll. The incident has gained world-wide attention  and the New Zealand Government has made known its determination to bring those responsible to full account for this outrage. Large scale investigations by the New Zealand police are still under way. Within New Zealand  two French nationals have been arrested and charged with murder  arson and conspiracy  and are due to come before the court in New Zealand in November this year.I shall not expand upon this notorious incident in detail  except to note that the latest public pronouncement by the Prime Minister of France  after the French Government's own most recent investigations  has acknowledged that agents of the French secret services did indeed sink the ""Rainbow Warrior""  acting under orders to that effect. It had earlier been established that  for the purpose of surveillance of the Greenpeace fleet  elements of French military forces had been deliberately introduced into New Zealand  under orders from their Government  without the permission of the Government of New Zealand and in derogation of our sovereignty.Small States must place reliance on international law and we must rely on the protection which the international community  through the United Nations  can give us in circumstances of this serious nature.Inquiries into the ""Rainbow warrior"" incident are still being pursued  and the Government of New Zealand is concerned that a traditionally good and highly valued relationship with the Government of France should continue. I am bound to note that the New Zealand Government addressed on 6 September 1985 a formal communication to the Government of France.In that message New Zealand has reserved its legal position and its rights of action under international law  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  with respect to matters arising from this unfortunate incident. That is a clear enunciation of our position in relation to an issue which is shown to implicate the responsibility of the French Government.It is certainly my Government's hope that the most recent statement by the French Prime Minister will provide a basis for resolving outstanding questions . between the two Governments arising out of the affair. And I am very pleased to report to the Assembly today that only last evening I met with the French Minister for Foreign Relations  Mr. Dumas  at the New Zealand Mission to the United Nations. He began to discuss possible ways to find solutions to problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior incident  and we have agreed to have another meeting within the next few days.By virtue of their vulnerability  smaller States have often felt that they must take additional steps to preserve their Charter rights. In the years following the Second World War  a number of countries  including New Zealand  moved  consistently with the Charter  into defensive treaty alliances. This has not meant  however  that countries such as New Zealand have forsaken their right to think for themselves or have abandoned significant sovereign rights. That was not intended.New Zealand  for example  as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty  has forgone the possession of nuclear weapons. We have also declared unambiguously that we do not want any country to defend New Zealand with nuclear weapons. In short  my Government does not seek to be part of any calculation that involves the accumulation of nuclear weapons. We will not have any nuclear weapons on our territory. We will not allow any to be brought in. And ships that are nuclear armed will not come into New Zealand ports.As will be clear from what I have already said in relation to the South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty  we have taken our own stand on principle  because in the South Pacific there is no need for a build-up of nuclear armaments - indeed  the reverse is true.The stand we have taken is fully consistent with New Zealand's active membership of the Western community. We see our participation in that community  our partnership with our friends and neighbors in the South Pacific and our support for this world Organization as cumulatively strengthening the fabric of peace in our part of the world.In practical terms  the effect of the re-evaluation of our interests that we have undertaken will be a new concentration of New Zealand's efforts on our immediate neighborhood. This will involve an expansion of New Zealand's political  economic and defense activities in the South Pacific region and the assertion of an increasingly active role there. This new and strengthened regional approach should provide the basis for a continued  sound and stable relationship with Australia and the United States based on a clear definition of New Zealand's interests and a policy of self-reliance.Events of recent years lead one to ponder whether the reiteration of the ideals of our Charter over the past 40 years has not bred a measure of easy familiarity  even of complacency  against which we should be very much on our guard in the period ahead. Even those States which themselves generated the great national revolutions - revolutions which inspired the League of Nations and our Charter - have only imperfectly acknowledged in practice the full implications of the existence of newly independent States and the democratic rights those States are perfectly entitled to see maintained and protected.I hope that our ocean region will not be vulnerable in that respect. It certainly need not be  and it is already organized in regional ways to assert its own distinctive voice internationally*Here  the United Nations can take its due credit in helping a tide of decolonization which has changed the political map of the Pacific dramatically. In 1945 no island country was independent; in 1985 12 are. United Nations stewardship has often been instrumental in the peaceful achievement of self-determination. The Charter  as well as the 1960 Declaration on decolonization  provided the guiding beacons for the navigators who plotted the course towards independence  and the Special Committee of 24 has monitored progress. It still continues to do so  and New Zealand will be happy to receive next year a Visiting Mission from the Committee to the last remaining overseas responsibility which New Zealand has - the island community of Tokelau.Decolonization in the South Pacific is not yet complete. In Micronesia to the north  lengthy negotiations per many years with the United States have produced Compacts of Free Association which have the support of the relevant peoples of the Trust Territory. We do not believe that unilateral changes should be made now to the agreed definition of the future relationship between the United States and the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. We will  however  look for and support an early termination of the Trusteeship Agreement in respect of those parts of the Trust Territory  in accordance with the expressed wishes of the peoples. We look forward to welcoming the Federated States of Micronesia  the Marshall Islands and Palau into membership of the South Pacific Forum before too long.Further south  the region watches anxiously the difficulties faced by the people of New Caledonia in building a consensus for independence in that country. The rights and aspirations of the indigenous Kanak people must be met in the context of New Caledonia's multiracial society. We regret the violence and loss of life which have occurred over the past year. New Zealand supports the present plan for the establishment of regional councils and a congress  leading to a referendum on self-determination before the end of 1987. We welcome the recognition by the administering Power  France  that independence is the logical outcome of this process. It will be important to ensure that the steps outlined are adhered to. The Kanaks have been disappointed too often in the past. Only by following a predictable and short pathway to independence can further disruption and violence be avoided.I have already noted that political emancipation and the assertion of a say in their own destiny have led the South Pacific countries to early recognition of the desirability of co-operation with each other. Political independence in the Pacific  as elsewhere  is not automatically accompanied by economic self-determination  but acting together has strengthened the voice of the region in international forums. And it can assist in tackling some of the intractable problems arising from smallness  isolation and a scarcity of resources. The island States depend heavily on external assistance. The international price of copra and sugar has a profound affect on people's daily lives. Some significant regional efforts have been made under the auspices of the South Pacific Forum to improve trade access  shipping  telecommunications and the knowledge and control of marine mineral and fishing resources.Distant water fishing nations have been less respectful of the region's main resource in the past. This situation is improving  largely as a result of the evasiveness of the Pacific Forum nations  and important multilateral negotiations with the Government of the United States on a treaty regulating fishing are currently under way. A successful conclusion will make possible control of purse seiner activity within the 200-mile economic zones of Pacific signatories  and eliminate an area of serious friction. New Zealand looks to the United Nations and other international bodies to continue to help is overcoming the problems of economic security for the very small island States  in support of the region's own efforts to do so.One issue on which the countries of the South Pacific are united is that of racial discrimination. We all have multiracial societies; we are all committed to making racial harmony the foundation for our nation-building. It follows that we are all totally opposed to the systematic racial discrimination that is practiced in South Africa under the name of apartheid. Since my Government came to office last year we have demonstrated our commitment to that cause: the South Africans have closed their consulate in Wellington  and a proposed rugby tour of South Africa has been canceled. All New Zealanders are appalled the rising tide of violence that is threatening to engulf South Africa. The South African Government must be persuaded to institute the necessary reforms before it is too late. It must be brought to realize that it cannot maintain apartheid by force. It must talk unconditionally to the leaders of the black majority. It must accept that racial partnership offers the only hope for the future of that tormented country. All of us must do whatever we can in a concerted way to produce this result. New Zealand's contacts with South Africa  whether economic or otherwise  are now minimal. I need hardly say that we shall readily comply with any additional sanctions imposed by the international community;I have focused on practical issues of importance to our Pacific neighborhood - because it is in workable solutions to those issues that the elements lie for continued stable and peaceful development in the South Pacific. He are aware of the larger dimensions to all these problems  and notably of the tensions that impede the prospect of achieving genuine disarmament in our time.Implicit in what I said earlier is that my part of the world is by no means impressed either with the speed of the global disarmament process or with the failure of the nuclear Powers to read an agreement on limiting their nuclear arsenals.In the General Assembly last year my Government gave expression to the conviction amongst New Zealanders  as amongst peoples everywhere  that nuclear weapons expose to annihilation those whom they purport to protect; that each new development in nuclear weaponry opens up a more alarming and a potentially more destabilizing prospect than the last. There are already more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy us all many times over. Yet the number goes on increasing. The dilemma is recognized universally. TO control the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually to eliminate them completely are goals of the greatest importance. Where those who have them and those who do not seem to differ is in the sense of urgency. And it is to the United Nations that smaller countries such as my own must look to express that agonizing conviction  which has so recently been voiced by the vast majority of countries assembled at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference just concluded in Geneva. A year age the Soviet Union agreed to take up the offer of the United States to resume bilateral arias control negotiations  with the goal of leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons everywhere. My Government greatly welcomed that move. The issues are complex. We know only too well that there will be no easy or necessarily quick solutions. But solutions are not beyond the skills of negotiation if the political will is there. New Zealand calls on the negotiating parties to pursue their task with good faith and the utmost urgency. The time is past for picking around the edges of the agenda or for diversionary proposals -time-bound and shrouded in propaganda.We would view with the deepest concern any prospect of competition between the major Powers extending into yet another environment - outer space. But we do not accept that there can be no progress in the talks on strategic weapons and intermediate-range nuclear forces as long as there is no agreement on outer space. The talks must not be held hostage in this way.Much hangs on the meeting that will take place shortly between President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev. We most earnestly hope for a successful outcome. We do not for a moment underestimate the complexities of the issues the two leaders must deal with. But we urge them to set a framework for a new co-operation from which the negotiations in Geneva may derive the momentum they need to reach agreements to stop the arms race.At the same time  the efforts of the international community towards meaningful international arms control agreements must continue. The Conference on Disarmament addresses many important issues. No task is more difficult than to forge reliable instruments of international law. But progress in the Conference on Disarmament is  at best  haltingly slow. We urge it to get on with its tasks with commitment and determination.This Assembly considers many disarmament and arms control proposals in the course of its deliberations. Many of these recommend what is practical and achievable. Some are symptomatic only of an ideological divide.One of the most serious proposals before the Assembly will again be the draft resolution  jointly sponsored by New Zealand end Australia  urging the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban. A comprehensive test ban  banning all testing in all environments permanently  is regarded by virtually all States as the most immediate and practical step that can be taken to halt and then reverse the arms race. Balanced  practical  verifiable  it will be a major restraint on the spread of nuclear weapons. It will straitjacket the development of new types of weapons without undermining existing strategic balances. It will inhibit compulsive competitiveness among the nuclear Powers.On two occasions  in the early sixties and in the late seventies  agreement was almost achieved on a comprehensive test ban. We have been disappointed by the setbacks which have prevented such a prohibition from being put in place. My delegation will again seek the means to encourage and speed up this work.We are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Time has not produced universal contentment with this Organization. Some of the criticisms which have been made arise from exaggerated and unrealistic expectations. As the Secretary-General reminds us in his latest annual report  the United Nations is not a super-State. It cannot do more than its Members will allow it to do. The policies of Member States have so far prevented the Organization from exercising some of the powers given it by the Charter. They have also prevented it from achieving some of its fundamental purposes. Those are facts.It is also a fact that the Charter remains the only universally accepted basis of international order. The principles it enshrines are generally recognized today  as they were 40 years ago  to be essential for world peaces and those principles are the foundations of the international regime under which we all live - a regime which  with all its failings  gives individual countries and peoples more freedom than they have ever had before. The United Nations is today the beacon of hope for all small nations. It is their democratic voice by which they can express their fears and their aspirations.The essential function of this Organization is to uphold the principles of the Charter. First in importance is the principle that ""all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force"". Living  as we do  under the threat of nuclear annihilation  we have as strong a common interest as ever in supporting the United Nations and helping to achieve this  its most elusive  but its moat vital  objective."
"94",5386,"OMN",40,1985,"It is ray pleasure warmly to congratulate the President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly on his election. I am confident that the vast and deep experience whichhe brings to this great post will be of the utmost help in ensuring the success of this session - this session at which we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and in which all peoples of the world place great hopes. Our pleasure is all the greater on this occasion because he represents Spain  a friendly country to which our country is bound by relations of friendship and respect. Spain has had close historical contacts with our Arab world  contacts that still have a positive effect on the development of relations between the Arab peoples and the people of Spain.I also express with pleasure my deep appreciation to Mr. Paul John Lusaka  the President of the last session  whose wisdom  knowledge and firmness gave depth and smoothness to the work of that session. This was evident in the excellent way in which he led the work of the thirty-ninth session and in the manner in which the General Assembly completed that work.I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation and admiration to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the efforts he has made since assuming that post. We wish him all success in his tasks  which everyone realizes are both difficult and complex. We express to him our support for his efforts  as well as our support for the goals of this international Organization  and our firm belief in the necessity of preserving its strength so that it can play its leading role in eliminating the specter of war and can contribute effectively to the solution of international problems.I take this opportunity also to express  through the delegation of Mexico  our deepest sympathy to the people and Government of Mexico in connection with the tragic earthquake they have experienced. It has caused great loss of life and destruction of property  and we hope that international solidarity will help Mexico to bear the burdens of this tragedy.As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we renew our commitment to the principles and purposes of its Charter and to the endeavor to strengthen further the role of the United Nations  which is the only international forum through which all countries seek the achievement of peace  progress and justice.We live today in a world where events change at an unprecedented pace. The crises and challenges faced by some countries and peoples reverberate in various parts of this globe. We live as one international family  in which crises intertwine  each one affecting the other. Our Organization can in no way remain isolated from those crises.In spite of the continued existence of hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world  the United Nations has remained the international forum to which countries involved in conflicts resort - taking shelter under its umbrella - in order to bring about peace among them. The United Nations has been able to contain regional wars  preventing them from turning into world wars. It has also proved itself able to achieve solutions commensurate with the questions of world peace and development and to pursue a balanced approach towards the present international issues.The Sultanate of Oman has adopted clear and well-known positions towards the hotbeds of major political tensions facing the international community. The foreign policy of the Sultanate is community to working towards the solution of international disputes through dialog and understanding. This policy is based on moral and legal standards  guided by the principles and purposes of the United Nations  and is committed to the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations.Every year we revive and assess past achievements  and then address ourselves to the large number of international questions still on the agenda of the General Assembly.If we compare the international situation today to that which prevailed a year ago  we see that in spite of the tireless efforts that have been made the international situation is still characterized by increasing tension and disputes and by escalating conflicts  in addition to the economic crisis that is strangling many countries.On the agenda of this session are the same questions that the General Assembly has dealt with at previous sessions. The inability of the United Nations to find viable solutions for the various problems that it faces is the result of the disregard by some countries of the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations. The question of Palestine is the clearest example of this.The cause of the Palestinian people is the oldest and most important question that the United Nations has dealt with since its inception. This year  when we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we find Israel still imposing its occupation on the Arab territories and refusing to allow the Palestinian people to exercise their right to live peacefully in a stable and secure homeland.The real obstacle faced by the international community in seeking to find a solution to the Palestinian question is Israel's refusal to comply with and implement the resolutions Adopted by the united Nations  and its rejection of all initiatives aimed at reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian question.The question of the Palestinian people does not lack initiatives; there have been several  such as the Venice declaration by the countries of the European Economic Community  the Brezhnev initiative  President Reagan's initiative  the Fez Arab summit declaration  the Geneva declaration of 1983 and  most recently  the Palestinian-Jordanian initiative  which was hailed by the last extraordinary Arab summit meeting  held in Casablanca. That latter initiative could be an instrument for achieving a just and lasting peace.The Arabs  by accepting those peace initiatives  have proved that they advocate security and peace  not the peace that Israel is trying to impose by force and the policy of fait accompli  but peace based on justice and international legitimacy  represented in united Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories and calling for the establishment of a national homeland for the Palestinian people so that the two peoples can co-exist: the Palestinian people in its independent State and the Israeli people.Time has proved beyond any doubt that Israel will not be able to achieve security and stability so long as it persists in denying the rights of the Palestinian people and so long as it continues to occupy the territories of the neighboring Arab countries  thereby violating their sovereignty and stability. It has also become clear that the logic of Israeli military might will not create stability and calm in the region.Dialog is the ideal way to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East. The Sultanate of Oman  believing in that approach  has supported all efforts aimed at achieving a just peace.Israel must for once show the same courage and wisdom as the Arabs and Palestinians have already shown and provide concrete proof that it seeks peace -just  firm and lasting peace for all. The countries friendly to Israel should play an important role in prevailing upon it and encouraging it to take those steps before it is too late.The Gulf region has witnessed for the cast five years one of the most destructive wars  which has claimed so many lives and caused destruction of  and damage to  property and installations. We appeal to all countries to pay more attention to the matter and speed up efforts to find a reasonable solution to end this raging war between two neighboring countries  Iraq and Iran. The continuation of the war on its present scale requires concerted efforts to put a firm end final end to it.If the war has been confined so far to the territories of the two warring countries  that does not guarantee that it will not in the future spill over their borders. The fact that neither country is able to inflict military defeat on the other must not lull the international community into believing that the war no longer poses a threat to international peace and security.Tension  confrontation  instability of relations between countries  conflicts of interests and international alliances may transform the Gulf war into a hotbed of international conflict threatening the security and stability of all the Gulf States  disrupting international navigation in the Straits of Hormuz  thereby inflicting damage not only upon the economies of the countries of the region  but also upon the world economy  especially the economies of developed countries.Proceeding from our realization of the dangers of that war and the need to put an end to it  the Sultanate of Oman has taken part in all efforts to that effect  whether those of States members of the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf  the Organization of the Islamic Conference or the Non-Aligned Movement. We also affirm the importance of the role of the United nations and the SecurityCouncil as well as the good offices of the Secretary-General  through which he has been able recently to achieve some relative progress in containing the conflict. He realize that much more must be done to put an end to the war  and we believe that it is important to co-ordinate the efforts of the United Nations and other international efforts.Iraq has adopted a clear position accepting the principle of negotiations with a view to achieving a just and peaceful solution  while the Islamic Republic of Iran has set pre-conditions to end the war. He believe that those countries with strong relations with either or both parties to the conflict have not made enough efforts to persuade them to resort to negotiations to solve the conflict before they reach a point of no return in the war and before reconciliation becomes impossible.As for Afghanistan  we still see  despite the passage of five years and the adoption of any General Assembly resolutions  the foreign presence hovering over the territories of a Moslem  non-aligned people. The events in Afghanistan provide the most glaring example of foreign interference in the internal affairs of other States  and the use of armed force to impose a fait accompli that the Afghan people cannot accept  denying a whole people the exercise of its legitimate right to select its own system of government  compatible with its religious beliefs and social traditions.In this context  we affirm our support for the talks going on under the supervision of the special representative of the Secretary-General between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Kabul Government. We hope that they will lead to a just settlement of the Afghan question which will promote the right of the Afghan people to self-determination and guarantee the safe and dignified return of the Afghan refugees to their homeland. We also hope that the talks will lead to a political settlement that will preserve the relations of good-neighborliness and non-interference between the Afghan people and other neighboring peoples.He should also like to commend the positive position of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and its constructive efforts aimed at making the negotiations succeed. In addition  we express our appreciation to it for its humane role of serving as host to and sheltering millions of Afghan refugees.In South-East Asia  the continued presence of Vietnamese military forces in Democratic Kampuchea has led to insecurity and instability in that area. The situation there presages a wide confrontation in the region that will have an adverse effect on international security and stability. Therefore  we renew once again our demand that united Nations resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchean territory be implemented. At the same time  we affirm our continued support for the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a just solution to the Kampuchean question - a solution that will achieve unity for that people  and enable it to enjoy the right to self-determination and to choose its own system of government.Our concern about the events in the Horn of Africa is due to the historical and geographical links between our country and that region. He believe that the instability there is due to the fact that the Horn of Africa has been continuously subjected to foreign intervention. The rivalry among the interests of States in the region leads more often than not to con fr cm tat ion. We are closely following developments - which naturally represent a source of concern to us. He call for an end to all attempts at interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.There is another problem  in southern Africa  which is a source of concern to us  namely  the question of Namibia. In that connection  we reaffirm our support of the Namibian people's achieving independence and self-determination and make clear that the central approach for the solution of this problem lies in accelerating the process of terminating the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa through the implementation of the relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization  particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978).We reiterate our denunciation of the policy of apartheid pursued by the Government of South Africa which runs counter to all noble aims  principles  divine laws and proper human behavior  we affirm the necessity of complying with the resolutions adopted every year by our Organization on this question. If those resolutions were implemented they would assist the black African majority in attaining its legitimate rights.My country  owing to its geographical location which overlooks the Indian Ocean and being a member of the Ad Hoc Committee cm the Indian Ocean established by the General Assembly  follows closely the situation in the region  we also participate in the work of that Committee  which is preparing the convening of an international conference that aims ultimately at the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of Peace. We do not want to be pessimistic about progress in that Committee's work; however  the facts do not leave much room for optimism. The Committee is still pursuing its work very slowly and that will not lead us speedily to the desired goal. In that regard we appeal to the member countries  particularly to the two super-Powers  to give greater momentum to the Committee's work so that it can achieve the desired result and hold the conference in the first half of 1986.The situation in Central America deserves our attention. Tension and violence are escalating in ways that raise concern and make it imperative that a solution of the disputes  domestic or foreign  be found quickly. The ideal approach for solving those conflicts must be based on respect of the rights of peoples and sovereignty of States so that no opportunity for interference in the internal affairs of States of the region is given to the great Powers.We support the efforts of the Contadora group and believe that they are the best guarantee for achieving peace in Central America. We wish it success in its good offices and call upon all States of the continent to choose co-operation and coexistence in peace instead of conflict and war.The escalating arms race and the possession of lethal destructive weapons in the past few years have gone beyond anything imagined. In spite of all its efforts  this international organization has been unable so far to put an end to this terrible race. Disarmament is no longer just a political issue  for its human side has become more important. Those weapons do not pose a threat to only one aspect of human life; they are a grave destructive danger to the very existence of our globe - not to mention the economic aspects which are of no less importance than the others  since arms expenditures could solve the economic problems facing the world  particularly the developing countries.In this connection  we express our satisfaction at the resumption of negotiations between the two super-Powers at Geneva. We hope that they will lead to putting an end to those destructive weapons. Peace and security for humanity are the main goals we must strive to achieve. My country supports all efforts aimed at limiting nuclear weapons. It also supports the efforts being made to proclaim the Middle East and the Indian Ocean zones of peace  free from destructive weapons.We welcome the forthcoming summit meeting between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev and hope that they will be able to reach positive results that will help reduce international tension  solve various crises and remove obstacles that face mankind.The international economic situation is not much different from that of security. There is continued regression in the following areas: shrinking international trade  instability of commodity prices and their continuous decreasing trend while the prices of manufactured goods are increasing  creeping protectionism  imposition of barriers against the outflow of capital  rising interest rates  and declining transfer of technology.This economic situation is also reflected in the chaos prevailing in the international monetary system. The countries of the third world  which depend on limited resources  although not alone are the hardest hit by the present economic situation. This has been demonstrated by the increasing imbalance in their foreign trade  their increasing indebtedness and their inability to service such debts owing to rising interest rates. The continuance of this abnormal situation without any attempt to check it will lead to increased suffering by the peoples of third-world countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America.It would be unfair to ourselves to accept this situation as a matter of fact and not work to find viable solutions for it. If the situation deteriorates further it will affect all of us  including the rich countries. We realize that the present economic system cannot deal with this crisis. Therefore we in the Group of 77 call for the establishment of a new international economic order based on more clarity and justice for all countries of the world  rich and poor.In spite of the deterioration of the international economic situation we should not give way to despair. We should follow the example set by international initiatives to confront the famine and the deteriorating economic situation in Africa  initiatives that demonstrated what the international will  when properly directed  can achieve. The excellent international spirit that confronted famine and drought in Africa should be an incentive for the initiation of a constructive dialog between North and South that can lead to the establishment of a new economic edifice in harmony with the hopes of the peoples of the world on this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.Our world is witnessing increasing terrorism in the form of the kidnapping of individuals  the hijacking of aeroplanes  the bombing of civilian installations and the killing of innocent people  we deplore terrorism in all its forms; we find it contradictory to lofty human and moral ideals and contrary to the teachings of our religion  Islam  and other revealed religions. We belong to a nation that takes pride in its civilization  ideals  traditions  religion and human heritage  and we consider terrorism and violence to be a phenomenon that reflects ideological bankruptcy.We call for a commitment to the principles of right and justice to achieve the goals we seek  for reliance on legitimate means of defending ideologies and national interests and for respect for the differences that exist between individuals and peoples.We will support every international or regional effort to combat terrorism  in whatever form it may take  and we call upon all States to co-operate closely in confronting and combating this dangerous political disease.In spite of all the difficult problems and crises faced by our world today we should not underestimate the progress achieved by the United Nations since its foundation. We still have hope that the United Nations will seek and find just and appropriate solutions for the different crises and problems that confront us.We appeal to all Members of this Organization to work together in this endeavor so that security and trust may prevail in our international community and confidence between States and peoples be strengthened."
"95",5432,"PAK",40,1985,"Mr. President  may I extend to you the warmest felicitations of the Pakistan delegation on your election as President of this fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. Spain has a glorious heritage as a pioneer in the age of discovery and has consistently played a positive role in the advancement of mankind. Your unanimous election is  therefore  as much a tribute to your great country as it is to your outstanding qualities that we have recognized during your long association with the United Nations.I would also like to express the deep appreciation of my delegation for the wise and inspiring leadership displayed by your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka. The skill  distinction and success with which he carried out his onerous responsibilities have gained for him and for his country  Zambia  the profound respect of the international community.I also wish to place on record our sincere appreciation for the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his dedicated efforts to uphold the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. His report on the work of the Organization (A/40/1)  on the eve of its fortieth anniversary  underlines the critical importance of the United Nations for the world and should inspire Member States to revive the vision that led to its creation.Forty years ago  the history of mankind took a momentous turn with the birth of the United Nations. The ravages of a war which claimed over 60 million human lives was fresh in the minds of the founding fathers of this world Organization  whose foremost objective was ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". They envisioned the evolution of an international community of free peoples  sharing equally in universal prosperity and peace. The United Nations represented a resolve  distilled through human experience of conflict and suffering  that  henceforth  international relations and the conduct of States must be determined by the rule of law and the principles of justice.The beginning of the nuclear age and the contemporary technological revolution have transformed the world  without bringing about a concomitant change in the attitudes of nations. Consequently  the international environment is dominated by great-Power confrontation and a spiraling nuclear-arms race  which present a grim and dis-quietening prospect for humanity. Regional conflicts continue to tear at the fabric of international peace and the specter of a nuclear war threatens the survival of mankind.This commemorative session is  therefore  an important occasion to explore possibilities to reverse the political and ideological polarization which has seriously impaired the ability of the United Nations to discharge its responsibilities. Today  more than ever before  the problems we confront - of nuclear arms as well as hunger and economic disequilibrium - are common problems for all of us and require collective solutions.The moral and philosophical concepts of the United Nations are designed to protect the interests and concerns of the less powerful States. Pakistan perceives the United Nations  and the rule of international conduct enshrined in its Charter  as a vital safeguard for its security. If the world is not to descend into a dangerous state of chaos  the ideals and principles of the United Nations must be defended wherever they are breached  in the Middle East  in southern Africa or in Afghanistan.Nearly six years ago  over 100 000 Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in flagrant violation of the political independence of that country and of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. In defense of their cherished freedom  which they have enjoyed almost without interruption for centuries  the Afghan people have waged a heroic struggle against military intervention and foreign domination. Across the length and breadth of the land hundreds of thousands of Afghans have sacrificed their lives and continue to do so to regain their lost freedom.More than three million Afghans have sought refuge in Pakistan  and this in itself is testimony to the popular rejection of the foreign presence and the magnitude of the suffering visited on the people of Afghanistan. Pakistan is providing these millions of refugees with shelter and the basic necessities of life as our islamic and humanitarian responsibilities  although our limited resources are severely strained.We are grateful to those friendly states and international agencies which have provided vital humanitarian assistance to them. The trauma and tragedy in the lives of the Afghan refugees will end only when they are able to return to their homes in safety and honor.The suffering of the Afghan people  after six years of war  can be brought to an end through a just and honorable political solution. For six years this Assembly  the Movement of Non-aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have expressed  in unequivocal terms  the opposition of the world community to foreign intervention in Afghanistan and have repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops  which would immediately bring peace and normalcy to the area.Pakistan has fully supported the Secretary-General's initiative to seek a negotiated solution of the Afghanistan issue. I take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  for their untiring efforts in the arduous negotiating process under way to evolve a comprehensive settlement of the issue. In the Geneva talks  the drafts being negotiated provide the framework for a political settlement. The agreements proposed could be speedily concluded if the central issue of the withdrawal of troops were resolved. We hope that at the next round of proximity talks this vital aspect can be satisfactorily addressed.Pakistan attaches great importance to these indirect talks for seeking a political solution to the Afghanistan issue. However  we shall not allow outside pressures to deflect us from our principled position. Grave threats have been held out publicly against Pakistan. We face repeated attacks from the Afghanistan side on towns and villages inside our territory. These wanton acts of aggression have caused heavy loss of life and damage to civilian property. During this year alone there have been 198 violations of Pakistan's airspace and territory. Let me make it clear that Pakistan will never submit to pressure  nor will it ever resile from the principles that have formed the basis of our policy on Afghanistan.The moral and political pressure exerted by the decisions of the General Assembly is of critical importance in ensuring progress towards an early termination of military intervention in Afghanistan and the restoration of peace in that country. The resolute stand taken by this Assembly on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan is also a reaffirmation by the Member States of the United Nations of its commitment to international principles and to the cause of a just political settlement of the crisis in Afghanistan.The external intervention in Kampuchea raises the same questions of principle. Pakistan supports the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and its struggle for national independence. We fully endorse this Assembly's repeated calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea  which would enable the Kampuchean people to choose their own government without outside interference.The tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq has thrown the region into turmoil and turbulence. That fratricidal war has continued for five long years  consuming the national wealth and the flower of the youth of two great nations. Pakistan is a neighbor and a country linked by common faith and a shared culture to Iran and Iraq. The continuation of their war causes us deep anguish. In the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-aligned Countries and the United Nations  Pakistan has spared no effort to try to end that war. Two weeks ago the Islamic Peace Committee convened its eighth meeting to explore the possibilities of a just and equitable solution to that fratricidal conflict. We hope that both parties will recognize and respond to the sincere efforts exerted by that Committee and demonstrate the political will required to reach a political settlement which reconciles the demands of justice with the imperatives of peace. Pakistan also fully endorses the mediator role of the United Nations Secretary-General in containing certain aspects of the Iran-Iraq conflict. We urge him to continue his efforts.The situation in the Middle East remains volatile and explosive. This conflict poses a grave threat to international peace and security. It is a conflict which is as old as the United Nations itself  and a long succession of peace initiatives have foundered on the rock of Israeli aggression  the latest manifestation of which is the wanton and outrageous Israeli attack on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunis - a brutal and dastardly act which has been condemned in the strongest terms by the Government and people of Pakistan.Israel has not relented in its policy of annexation by creating Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and thus changing the demographic character of the area. It persists in its repression of the Palestinian and Arab population. We are specially concerned about the desecration of holy places under Israeli occupation  in particular the excavations which threaten the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque.Peace in the Middle East  as elsewhere  can be achieved and sustained only by according justice to all parties. The dictates of justice demand that three principles should constitute the basis for a settlement. The first is the right of self-determination of peoples  which has been denied to the Palestinian people and lies at the root of the problem in the Middle East. The people of Palestine mustbe enabled to exercise this right and to create a State of their own in their homeland. Secondly  there must be unequivocal support for the fundamental principle that territory cannot be required by the use of force. Israel must agree to withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the holy city of Jerusalem  the West Bank and Gaza  as well as from the Golan Heights. Thirdly  any durable settlement must be comprehensive in nature. This can be achieved only with the participation of all the parties directly concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.Pakistan  therefore  fully endorses the proposal to convene an international conference on the Middle East with a view to evolving a just and comprehensive settlement as envisaged in the 1982 Fez Peace Plan. However  until suitable conditions are created for such an international conference  the world community should support and encourage all endeavors which might overcome the diplomatic inertia and help pave the way for a comprehensive settlement. We hope that Israel's experience in Lebanon has brought home the futility and grave consequences which flow from aggression and expansionism.The past few months have seen a massive resurgence in South Africa against the inhuman system of apartheid. Scores of valuable lives have been lost as the protests continue in the face of ruthless and savage measures adopted by the South African authorities. Clearly  apartheid  which continues to exist as a blot on the human conscience  cannot survive for long. It is high time the international community provided moral succor to the struggling black population by isolating and ostracizing the Pretoria regime. As the curtain descends on the shameful dogma of apartheid. South African colonialism is making a last attempt to entrench itself in Namibia. Seven years have passed since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) outlining the plan for the independence of Namibia. Meanwhile  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the authentic voice of the Namibian people  and other African States have sought every diplomatic recourse  including several rounds of negotiations with the South African authorities  in pursuit of the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. Regrettably  these efforts have been thwarted by South Africa  which has sought to create one obstacle after another and has raised entirely extraneous and irrelevant issues.The independence of the Namibian people  which is their sacrosanct right  cannot be made hostage to the whims of the universally discredited Pretoria regime. The Western States who were the authors of the plan for Namibia's independence and  ironically  whose links with South Africa appear to sustain its intransigence  bear a heavy responsibility to bring the chapter of colonialism in Namibia to a close. New initiatives are required on the part of the five members of the Western contact group to compel South Africa to give up its control of the territory  thus fulfilling the promise made seven years ago to the Namibian people and to the international community.Pakistan remains committed to the promotion of an environment of peace and stability in our region in which the peoples of the countries of the area can fulfill their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future. We have made unremitting efforts in striving for this goal and have consistently supported initiatives designed to serve the cause of peace in the region. We have welcomed the initiative taken by Nepal in declaring that country a zone of peace. We have also worked diligently within the United Nations to promote the objective of the establishment of a zone of peace in the region of the Indian Ocean.I am happy to state that the nations of the South Asian region have made systematic progress towards mutual co-operation for the economic and social uplift of their peoples and for building a climate of confidence and understanding on the basis of the principles of sovereign equality and mutual benefit. We look forward to the summit meeting of the members of the South Asian Regional Co-operation  to be held in Dhaka in December  which  we are confident  will prove to be a landmark in promoting stability and harmony in our region.To dissipate the clouds of suspicion and mistrust which have afflicted the history of inter-State relations in South Asia in the past  sustained and determined efforts are required both in the regional context and on the bilateral plane. It is in this spirit that Pakistan is working assiduously for the establishment of tension-free  good-neighborly relations with India  which both countries recognize as an indispensable condition for peace and stability in the area and for the national development of the two countries.Over the years  Pakistan and India have moved away from the bitterness and acrimony of the past towards a more co-operative relationship. This is evident from the steady increase in high-level contacts at the political and official levels and is also illustrated by the successful outcome of the second meeting of the Pakistan-India Joint Commission  which was held in New Delhi last July.Pakistan has also proposed to India the conclusion of a bilateral agreement to outlaw aggression and the use of force. This would help to remove mistrust and would contribute to the strengthening of mutual confidence. In this spirit  we seek a just and honorable settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir question  we are also ready to undertake joint commitments and reach agreements with India  on the basis of the principles of sovereignty and reciprocity  for enhancing mutual security  for preventing a return to confrontation and for keeping our area free of nuclear weapons.As repeatedly affirmed by President Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq  Pakistan is committed  and shall remain committed  not to develop nuclear weapons or allow their deployment on its soil. This solemn commitment is rooted in our conviction that disarmament is a moral imperative in this nuclear age.Sharing this universal concern of our age  Pakistan has joined other non-nuclear-weapon States in demanding the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and urging the nuclear-weapon States  particularly the Soviet Union and the United States  to make progress towards nuclear disarmament and the prevention of a nuclear war. We are therefore heartened by the resumption  after a long hiatus  of the Geneva talks between the two super-Powers.The United Nations has an indispensable role to play in the promotion of the objective of disarmament and in raising the collective awareness of the grave danger posed by the existence of nuclear arms and the spiraling arms race  which is now reaching out to outer space.Pakistan is also convinced of the validity of regional and interim measures against the spread of nuclear weapons  particularly their vertical proliferation. Accordingly  Pakistan has offered specific proposals within the framework of the United Nations for negative security guarantees for non-nuclear weapon States and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. Our initiative for a joint declaration for the non-acquisition of nuclear weapons by the regional States is motivated by our desire to explore ways to keep our area free of nuclear weapons.At the bilateral level  we have made the following offer to India: simultaneous signature of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons? simultaneous acceptance of full-scope safeguards? bilateral inspection of each other's nuclear facilities; and a binding declaration by all South-Asian States renouncing the acquisition or manufacture of nuclear weapons.On this question we ace also open to any other suggestions our Indian neighbors may wish to make.Thus  at the bilateral  as well as at the regional and global levels  Pakistan has taken positive steps and has made a constructive endeavor to curb the menace of nuclear arms.He believe in a comprehensive approach in matters relating to disarmament and find merit in all efforts  whether they are global  regional or bilateral  or long-term in character. He are also convinced of an inherent correlation between disarmament and the global security environment  which is borne out by the experience that the goals of disarmament cannot be achieved in an international political situation of tension and conflict.A grave consequence of the arms race is the colossal drain on global resources which could be utilized for improving the quality of life for which unprecedented opportunities are provided by the contemporary technological revolution. According to estimates  nearly $1 000 billion worth of resources are spent every year for the manufacture of means of death and destruction and to fuel the arms race. This is an intolerable situation which must be rectified  and the resources thus released must be diverted to combat deprivation and hunger.For the past several years representatives from developing countries have stood at this podium and have spoken of the deep crisis in the international economic system. This year we have heard eloquent statements from several Heads of State who have given a vivid account of how the economic crisis and the structural imbalances in the world economic system have affected the well-being of their people and the socio-political structures in their countries. The food crisis in Africa and the grave problem of indebtedness of the third world clearly underscore the need for urgent and concerted action on the economic issues that are faced by the international community.Regrettably  appeals for co-operation have been to no avail  as major industrialized countries continue to look towards short-term and narrow economic interests rather than agreeing to join hands in a global effort to improve the external environment. The process of recovery of their economies which  the developed nations argue  will in the long run bring succor to the economies of the developing countries and the fear that joint action may erode the special privileges enjoyed by them have impeded a global vision for a healthy and equitable world economic order.For several years now  there has been no meaningful dialog between the industrialized countries and the developing countries to find common solutions to the complex problems of the international economic system. In the meantime  the developing countries which continue to bear the major burden of adjustments and the grave consequences of external indebtedness are being pushed dangerously close to the brink of social and political upheaval. The means available to finance the development of their economies are choked off by higher interest rates  tougher payment terms and other conditions imposed by commercial banks  harsh terms demanded by the'International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the rising tide of protectionism and the deteriorating terms of trade. In such an inhospitable environment  failure of domestic policies of the developing countries is unjustly cited as a major cause for their inability to pay the external debt and at the same time meet the basic requirements of their own people.It is self-evident that both the external environment and domestic policies exercise a powerful impact on the process of economic development. Policies pursued by the developing countries in the domestic field aimed at rapid economic development cannot succeed in the face of adverse international economic conditions. Admittedly  these policies need to be improved; but the fact remains that  in the face of imbalances in the international economic system  no adjustments in domestic policies can produce more than marginal results.It is unfortunate that a proposal to launch global negotiations has been languishing for over five years. We sincerely hope that the fortieth anniversary celebrations of the United Nations will recapture the spirit of co-operation which led to its creation and pave the way to a genuine dialog among all nations. Perhaps we could begin by agreeing on a global agenda for a North-South dialog to be continued in the appropriate specialized forums. This session should also try and indicate the priorities that are required for urgent and long-term action.Pakistan believes that urgent measures must be taken to enable the developing countries to derive legitimate benefits from the current economic recovery. For this purpose  the flow of resources to the developing countries roust be increased speedily and significantly so as to create mutually reinforcing economic expansion in all States. Such immediate measures should include increased official development assistance   expansion of IMF quotas  new issues of special drawing rights  a roll-back' of trade protectionism and a durable and equitable solution of the debt problem. Simultaneously  efforts must be initiated to introduce the structural changes required to achieve rationality and equity in international economic relations  particularly in the international monetary and trade systems  as also in technological and industrial co-operation.The extraordinary debt burden of the developing countries must be viewed not only as a threat to the international banking system but also as an impediment to higher growth rates in the developing countries and a constraint on the scope and durability of the current economic recovery. Efforts must be made to find a long-term and equitable solution for the commercial debt of the middle-income countries and the official debt of the low-income countries.As the United Nations marks its fortieth anniversary the human condition has declined to new depths of insecurity  suffering and deprivation. Our generation is confronted with the awesome threats of annihilation  hunger  poverty  cancerous wars and conflicts whose menace seems interminable.We must however be careful not to attribute the emergence of this scenario of despair to the advent of the United Nations on the world scene. For the Organization has also seen the expansion and flowering of technology and skill  the exploration of space  the eradication of disease  and the increasing use of international co-operation and mutual assistance in international conduct; in short  a better organized world order which has spurred human ingenuity and intelligence to fresh heights of achievement. The paradox of the failures and achievements of our generation is  in fact  the human predicament which can be remedied only by strengthening an all-encompassing international organization like the United Nations.As we meet here this year  let us rededicate ourselves to the cause of global peace and human progress. Let us again pledge  notwithstanding lapses in the past  to renounce aggression and recourse to war. Let us all devote ourselves to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter which offer the only beacon light in an anguished and bewildered world."
"96",5475,"PAN",40,1985,"It is in the most sincere spirit of the solidarity that should reign among all Member States of our Organization that I wish to reiterate the heartfelt condolences of Panama  in which I am certain we all share  on the tragedy which has recently stricken the noble brother people of Mexico and to reaffirm our readiness to help alleviate its sorrow and assist in its reconstruction at this time of such serious economic difficulties for Mexico caused by its foreign debt. I wish to express our satisfaction at the adoption by the General Assembly the day before yesterday of a resolution in support of Mexico.Please accept our congratulations  Mr. President  on the wise choice which the General Assembly has made in selecting you to lead it on the occasion of this historic anniversary.Panama's commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and our national interest in abiding strictly by it are an expression of the heartfelt desire of the Panamanian people to make of this planet a place where harmonious co existence  justice and peace prevail.The celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations is unquestionable evidence of its vitality  of the need for it and of its role. Its preventive and moderating action has prevented or contained actions detrimental to the very existence of the human race which might otherwise have proved incontrollable. However  despite four decades of vigilant efforts and tangible achievements and only 15 years from the 21st century  peace  justice and respect for the integrity of States and for human dignity are being breached or seriously endangered My country believes that detente and peace should reign everywhere.In analyzing the international situation we must give a very special place to Latin America  a continent which faces an enormous challenge.For more than three decades now Latin America has been experiencing a high population growth whose pressure on our socio-economic and political systems we were largely able to bear because it was offset by an economic take-off which incorporated considerable sectors of the people in development. Latin America presented itself as a continent with a future.However  from the mid-1970s  Latin America began to suffer under the pendulum effects of the world economy  the drastic increase in inflation and oil prices  negative fluctuations in international trade and in the prices of our raw materials and also in interest rates. At the same time  while we lost foreign exchange through adverse terms of trade  which tended to stifle growth  there was an increase in the massive availability of international capital  opening up to our countries the road to indebtedness  which we embarked upon in the hope of recovering our rate of economic and social development after the recession of 1974 to 1976.The results  however  were not those expected. Latin America's debt -necessary to a certain extent as a supplement to our own swings - grew at an average of 19 per cent a year between 1974 and 1981  until today it has reached the enormous level of approximately $370 billion  dangerously exceeding reasonable limits. The financing period  which averaged eight to 10 years  was extremely short  since those funds were being invested basically in long-term economic and social projects  which were slow to recover. The disequilibrium in the terms o£ trade was sharply accentuated between 1979 and 1982. The price of imports from industrialized countries - oil for the second time - and interest rates rapidly increased  while the prices of Latin American products in international markets went down. For Central America and Panama the terms of trade worsened by 25 per cent between 1979 and 1982. More than $80 billion of Latin American's external debt  25 per cent of the total  was due to appropriate compensation for these factors.The most significant problem of adjustment lay in the difference in the expectations of the economic policy. The developed countries decided to reduce inflation at a time when Latin America was applying an economic policy which required the persistence of world-wide inflation. In the end  cheap money became more expensive and the extent of the present crisis became clear.This crisis in Latin America occurs in a context which makes it even more serious. At present population growth continues to be high  with an annual average rate of growth of 2.4 per cent in our countries. Half the population is under 20 years of age and it has important social needs in health  nutrition and education. The labor market is invaded every year by millions of new workers seeking jobs. Because of the rural to urban migration the population of the 80 principal Latin American cities has doubled in the past 20 years. The same phenomenon is expecting in the coming decades  thus creating extraordinary economic  social and political pressures. Although the present population pressure has begun to subside  which is good  the important needs of the existing population will continue to be felt until the end of the century.As a result of its own dynamics  Latin America is at a turning point in its history. Some Latin Americans have attained acceptable levels of development; others are moving in that direction amidst major difficulties; one third are still living in extreme poverty and alienation. But education  communications  and transportation systems have created expectation of a better future is possible and it is for us  the leaders  to channel that aspiration with realism  but also with faith and hope.Large-scale efforts are necessary singly to maintain this situation; in order to improve it we require economic growth of 5 per cent a year in the region and a considerable change in Latin American economic relations.The debt problem has exacerbated the difference between the worlds of the North and the South and has made more dangerous the gap between the poor and the rich countries. Latin America owes $370 billion and developing countries owe more than $850 billion. This makes necessary urgent changes of a financial nature which place relations between debtors and creditors on a more just and realistic level. We must recognize that the problem is not one of debt and our region only; it is a global problem because of the participants - developing countries  developed countries and international banking and financial institutions - and because it encompasses all areas of the international economy. Therefore  its solution must be global.Recognizing this fact  in the last three years the world has implemented some solutions based on three fundamental premises: first of all  that Latin-American countries would adjust their economies to new realities and that this would lead to a period of economic stagnation; secondly  that this effort at adjustment would be supported by the banking and financial community with additional resources and through a restructuring of the external debt; lastly  that  in addition to recovering their economic growth levels for their own good and in order to provide for world-wide recovery  the industrialized countries would keep their markets open to the exports of developing countries to assist in the recovery of their economies and their debt servicing. This solution was envisaged three years ago in recognition of the global scope of the problem. The results? however  have not been enough.Latin America has done its part  but it cannot continue to make adjustments in the midst of stagnation. We are all part of the problem and we are all part of its solution. It behooves each one of us to shoulder our share of the responsibility in order to achieve results.A solution which is based only on economic formulations is doomed to failure  because only one that takes account of human and social factors will open up the way to a global solution. A good agreement must take into account the potential of Latin American material and human resources  but also the constraints of its limitations. The peoples of Latin America cannot be pressured to the limit of their capacity. To try to push our peoples beyond what they can endure is to threaten the very foundations of our societies. The feeling that the time has come for democracy and human rights is vibrant in Latin America and it would be shortsighted to frustrate it by not providing economic paths more in tune with our needs.Latin America must satisfy the needs of its people through economic growth  and for that it is necessary that in addition to contributing  with dignity our own efforts  vie receive more co-operation from the two other major protagonists in the solution. International banking has undertaken a major effort in refinancing  but it must be recognized that in the last two or three years sufficient resources have not been transferred to Latin America; which has made the situation worse  we cannot think that the region can continue with a negative net transfer of resources. That is not the way in which any country has achieved development. It is essential to adopt policies that reduce interest rates  which are very high in real terms and which constitute a heavy burden on our balance of payments  limiting the capacity of the economies of the region to grow. The peoples of Latin America will never understand that they are working merely to pay interest.On the other hand  it is important for the industrialized countries to achieve a rate of economic development of at least 3 or 4 per cent per annum in real terms  and to keep trade as open as possible so that they may buy our products and we theirs; that is the only way to invigorate the world economy.After three years of experimentation the time has come to re-define the rules of the game and to set goals which will enable us 'co resolve two crucial points: economic growth with greater social well-being  and debt payment on different terms.We are aware of many serious studies which have examined constructive and appropriate alternatives with a view to reaching better solutions. If we must further adjust to our situation  then let us all do so  developed and developing countries alike  so that by giving free rein to new creative energies we may respond to the needs of our peoples.Therein lies the challenge we all face  for peace and security in Latin America depend on our bringing concrete solutions to the needs of our peoples and on our meeting their legitimate demands for improved living standards  for a full exercise of democracy and for genuine respect for their freedom and dignity. We cannot think of paying the debt at the cost of our peoples believing that progress and happiness are not possible in the Latin American democracies.We  the leaders of Latin America  will not accept being faced with the dilemma of choosing between keeping faith with our peoples and paying the debt; for we will keep faith with our peoples. Such a dilemma would affect us all  debtors and creditors alike; thus  it is obvious that it is for all of us to make the choice which will be of benefit to us all. It is our responsibility to guide our peoples along the path of progress  freedom  democracy  opportunity and solidarity.Good economic and social health in Latin America is advantageous to the industrialized countries  in particular those of the Americas. Our interests are complementary  just as our efforts to achieve well-being  security and peace should be joint efforts.I believe it necessary to appeal to the conscience and historic responsibility of Ministers  heads of central banks  and the organizations which will soon meet in Seoul: The time has come for new decisions on international financing  trade among countries  and development; to act now  with a sense of balance and responsibility  will result in greater success for all  with a lower political and security cost. The road to peace depends on their action now.I wish now to speak of our efforts to contribute to peace-making in Central America. He have come a long way towards honing the Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America to the point at which it can be signed by all parties. The Governments of Colombia  Mexico  Venezuela and Panama have received many expressions of solidarity and support from the rest of Latin America  and recently  in more concrete terms  from the Lima Group made up of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  from the United Nations  from the Organization of American States  from the Non-Aligned Movement  from the European Economic Community  and from the international community in general. But we have reached the point at which we need more than mere expressions of support.In truth  very few points in the Act are still under discussion  and differences of position have been considerably reduced  to the point at which a text of the Act which could be approved no longer seems an impossibility  or even a labor of years.However  I insist once again - and £ know that in this I am joined by the representative Governments of Colombia  Mexico and Venezuela - that in addition to the political will for peace that must soon be exercised by thecountries of Central America - with which the Contadora Group has been holding discussions and co-ordinating meetings  drafting and refining agreements  promoting and fostering conciliation - the responsibility for peace goes beyond the scope of Contadora; it extends to the Governments of countries with interests and ties in this region  where violence among brothers sows grief and desolation.We are close to peace  but we are also close to increasingly dangerous and serious risks of a general conflict  whose unforeseeable consequences could have an impact on the entire world. We are in the twilight between night and day; at this historic time for Central America  it is of fundamental importance that we opt for the dawn.As an active Member of the United Nations  Panama energetically condemns the arms race  which continues to grow.The rivalry between the super-Powers is of deep concern to us  as are the violent actions which threaten world peace on the various continents.*!e support the peaceful settlement of the problem of the Korean peninsula through direct dialog between its two parts. We also wish to express our wish that the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea may soon join the United Nations as fully fledged Members  so that both parts of the Korean peninsula may be present in this Organization.It is our wish that General Assembly resolutions on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan be faithfully implemented  and we support the Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a negotiated political settlement of the problems of that nation.We reaffirm the need for respect for the rights of the Palestinian people and of the people of Israel  as well as those of the other States and peoples of the region  to live in peace within secure boundaries.We stress that the war between Iran and Iraq must come to a halt  along with the foreign occupation of Cyprus and the tragic situation in Lebanon.We believe a solution satisfactory to Argentina should be reached in the situation of the Malvinas Islands.The alarming situation in Africa is of great concern to us. We recognize Africa's vital need to develop and to free itself from the servitude which has condemned millions of Africans to hunger.We support African nations in their struggle to free themselves once and for all from all systems and forms of domination  exploitation and racism. We support the efforts of the front-line countries against colonialism in the region and stand in solidarity with the desire of the people of the Saharaoui Arab Republic for self-determination and independence.We are outraged at South Africa's policy and practice of racism and apartheid which shocks all civilized nations and all those who believe in the dignity  equality and the inalienable right to justice and happiness of the human person. We strongly condemn its illegal occupation of Namibia.Terrorism in all its manifestations is a practice which our country rejects and condemns because it violates the fundamental principles governing coexistence in societies and because it affects innocent men and women the victims of crimes which have been found reprehensible by all mankind.We must promote peace and justice. I. am convinced that we can without delay take advantage of the possibilities which are opening up towards the realization of our own destinies and towards the elimination of inequality and imbalances in development that divide countries in two traditional blocs. We are convinced of the capacity for communication among men  of the wish of peoples to coexist and of the real possibility to achieve peace in the world.Everyone can make a contribution towards enhancing communication between men and between peoples. We are especially proud to have had such an historical noble responsibility for almost 500 years  in facilitating the passage of goods and men between the oceans through the isthmus of Panama. Hence we have opted for peaceful negotiation in the highest spirit of consultation and mutual respect in our dealings with the United States of America over the thorny problem of the Panama Canal. The Torrijos-Carter treaties of 1977 show that both countries are well disposed to an orderly and harmonious transition of the primary responsibility for administering and defending this waterway until the last day of 1999  when it will be fully Panama's. Panama asked for and received international support for its cause. It pledged itself before the world to act with a great sense of responsibility  and it has done so. Today we continue to develop our democracy  our national independence and our economy. We are vigilant to ensure that those Canal pacts are adequately implemented  to resolve through bilateral negotiationsany pending problems of interpretation of the treaties and to bring about the work of widening the canal in the Corte Culebra  which is necessary in order to maintain the efficient operation of the present canal in accordance with the needs of international navigation. At the same time  we are preparing to meet the long-term future. To that end  within the symbolic framework of the United Nations Headquarters  a few minutes ago my country signed with the United States of America and Japan arrangements to undertake studies on alternatives to the Panama Canal so that the people of Panama may be as well informed as possible when the time comes to decide  in sovereignty  its options to continue to offer on a long-term basis an efficient and safe service for international trade and transport.Panama is on its way to becoming a major inter-American center of international trade  as envisaged by the great liberator Simon Bolivar  always faithful to our history and Latin American heritage.We are at a crossroads: to offer our peoples answers to find the path to peace and progress or to prepare ourselves to face violence which would go beyond our region and also affect the richer and more developed countries  We cannot go back to the path of inflation and to the draining of the scarce resources of our countries for the benefit of the rich nations. We cannot remain in stagnation  which brings about disenchantment and frustration. We have the technology and the know-how; we have leaders capable of seeing things within a true historical perspective; we have peoples who desire peace  freedom and progress. It is now our role to offeL-  with optimism  creativity and perseverance  the individual and collective leadership which history has placed upon us all.On this new anniversary of the United Nations  let us renew the original commitment of mankind to win the war against hunger  poverty  disease  racism and inequality  for that is the true path to peace and the destiny God offered man when He endowed him with freedom and with creative force."
"97",5522,"PER",40,1985,"Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly and representative of Spain  a country in which the Latin American community asserts its roots  acknowledging it as a fundamental ingredient of its own identity.Mr. Secretary-General  symbol of Peru's commitment to the international community and of our faith that the transformation of Peru is linked to change and justice in the world.Representatives of all nations:For some this is a ritual  a declarative and symbolic meeting. We have not lost faith  because we know that those who are listening to us are a bureaucratic agency  but rather that they fully assume their role as representatives of mankind in the face of selfishness  poverty and violence in our world.Of course we could ask whether in its 40 years of existence the United Nations has fully achieved its purpose  whether peace really exists in the world. And we might answer that nuclear peace is but a balance of insecurity and terror  that this apparent peace expresses its tensions by shifting its conflicts to the poorestcountries; and that it conceals an unequal and unjust economic system in which the central nations dominate the others for their own benefit by manipulating interest rates  prices  wages and therefore wielding power in the poorer countries  in order to maintain profound injustices that generate violence.But to say all this would be to repeat the litany that has so often been heard in this hall.I have come here to state once again that in spite of this  the United Nations remains the highest representation of mankind and that we have come to it because we believe in the equality of human beings and of nations  and because we believe that history will not be determined by the laws of the marketplace and of conflict  but rather that its meaning will henceforth be the affirmation of freedom. Thus  our first words are an appeal for the democratization of this Organization which  in accordance with its Charter  is based on the principle of equality among itsmembers. but in which the Security Council is governed by the realities of the last great war and the five Powers possess a right of veto that is incompatible with that equality. That right of veto is a blot upon our Organization because it is an institutional recognition of force  and the vicious circle is completed because in order to eliminate the veto the agreement of the Council  on which those Powers with the veto right are represented  is necessary.One group of countries  however strong  cannot contradict the universal nature of this Organization. No Power  however much it may contribute financially  can demand a weighted and contribution-linked vote in which each nation is valued on the basis of the amount of money it contributes. We prefer a poorer organization  a less bureaucratic one  but an organization prouder of its moral dignity. In this connection we would propose that the economic contribution of all countries be the same  because higher contributions by the richest must be rejected if they in turn require the mortgaging of our destiny.The strength of the united Nations does not reside in the number of offices or functionaries that it may have throughout the world; the strength of the United Nations should reside in the moral power of the equality of all its Members and in its capacity to act without vetoes.In this  which is the highest court of mankind  we commit ourselves to a bid for life and  without surrendering to defeatism  we proclaim that  while assemblies and words may not have conquered selfishness  we  the poor of the world  have not lost our hope in the meaning of history.To those who use arrogant force  we respond in the words of the old Spanish philosopher: they will succeed but they will not convince. They may succeed through the power of their bombs and their money  but they will not convince the universal democracy of consciences  and in spite of them the hope for a better mankind will continue to be felt.I"" speak on behalf of a nation that is struggling  a nation that does not give up. I have not come here to repeat what has been said already of the world order and what all of us must do in the future to change it; I have come to state what we are doing at present  and the message that I bring to you is a message of determination. We believe in the solidarity of countries and in their common future  but today we affirm that action is the duty of all countries. That is what we are proposing in respect of each of the subjects on which I should like to dwell at this times the debt problem  human rights  drug trafficking and disarmament.In connection with all these issues  we have but one message: we have the will to act here and now.Many believe that Peru is a country of drugs  death and violation of human rights. I have cone here to say that there is much more to the truth. He are a part of the impoverished peoples of the earth  a part of Latin America  and our problems have as a root cause our link with the international economy. For lack of a national program of action  our country has been at the service of external interests and each of the economic cycles of this century has stemmed from changes in the international system.Peru was at the beginning of this century a country that was primarily an exporter of raw materials at a time when these were required by the international economy. At that time the Andes region and its peasant population were kept under the landowner system. At the end of the Second World War  Peru began its process of industrialization  but this was the result of the expansion of world industry  whose transnational corporations sold their machinery and established their branches in the capital of my country.Furthermore  when foreign foodstuffs were introduced in consumer markets the poverty of the peasants worsened  causing a greater exodus towards the cities.In this framework  the world crisis meant that new adjustments were needed in Peru  when the richest countries moved towards protectionism and strove to collect their debts  we were forced to open up our borders and destroy our industries in order to buy from world industry  and also to recycle our debts  with ever-increasing rates of interest.As a result of all this  a grave crisis is shaking my country. The disparity in regional development reflects the gap between the administrative industrial bloc and the marginal peasant and urban sector. Furthermore  the gap between rich are poor is widening. Our per capita production has gone back to levels comparable to those of 20 years ago and inflation and unemployment are on the increase.This is the tragic situation which my country is now confronting  but Peru is a country that has made democracy effective by asserting its will. Peru does not want to be a ship adrift at the mercy of shifts in the international economy. Peru does not want to remain within this vicious circle  devaluing its currency because inflation increases when interest rates go up in order to compensate for previous devaluations. Peru has decided to manage its own economy and not be managed by it  and that is why democracy in my country is the concrete expression of our national will.We know that to carry out a democratic revolution we must be anti-imperialist and fight against hegemonism. We know that transformation is not a national fact of life  but rather an international commitment to action.That is why we are members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and why we assert the unity of Latin America; that is why we seek to strengthen the Andean Pact and that is why we shall participate in all forums that affirm the solidarity of all peoples on earth.In the face of today's crisis we cannot wait; we must act. We cannot go on talking and writing letters that the wealthy of the earth refuse to read. Our people cannot await action by the irresolute. Supranational organizations cannot become an impediment to the will of our people. That is why I have come before this Assembly to set forth what we in Peru are doing to ensure the establishment of a nationalist  democratic Government of the people.We affirm as nationalism the right of our people to autonomous existence  the right to work  and to defend our industry from the liberal opening up that in recent years has overwhelmed it. We affirm as nationalism the recovery of our natural wealth.Here one fundamental issue arises; the foreign debt  as a major hindrance to the development and well-being of our peoples. The foreign debt expresses a relationship between the rich and the poor of the earth; its root cause is the imbalance of the prices of raw materials and manufacturing and industrial resources.Throughout the centuries the countries that are today underdeveloped have financed the mercantile and industrial economics of those that are now wealthy countries  and in the last few years we have fallen into debt in order to finance a model of industrialization and consumption imported from abroad. As a result  the debt has become a cause of conflict between the poor South  of which our American continent is a part  and the industrial  imperialist  financial North. This must not be confused with an issue that pits East against West in a conflict of hegemony.Secondly  the original indebtedness has been inflated by the application of usurious interest rates. Interest has been  in the central countries  not only the cost of productive capital  but also a tool for the procurement of capital to cover the deficit produced by military expenditures. That is why two thirds of the America's debt has been re-exported to the banks by the dominant sectors of our countries. And if the effects of unequal trade are added to the interest rates  we see that these have amounted in real terms to nearly 25 per cent.Thirdly  the over-valuation of the dollar as a currency of exchange based upon the permanent devaluation suffered by our own currencies has readied  according to some estimates  nearly 40 per cent  and we are required to repay our debts in that currency.I give the following dramatic example from ray own country  we purchase corn from the United States to feed chickens with which we are repaying in kind our debt to the Soviet Union. Thus  a country that is threatened by hunger has to repay its foreign debt with food. We therefore become a stopover for products that travel from one Power to another.If to that we add the fact that the rich countries have been applying protectionist fcKade policies  by closing their markets to our products  we can see why the debt situation has become untenable for our economy.We must ask: what has been the response to the debt problem in recent years?First of all new credits have been requested to repay earlier debts  and higher interest rates and commissions have been accepted. The result has been more indebtedness than before. The anti-trust laws of the united States have been violated by the banks  which have joined in cartels to avoid free competition in the placement of credits. Likewise  federal credit laws have also been violated as banks have renegotiated with countries that they know are bankrupt? solely in order to ensure the payment of interest  waiving the payment of principal  which is the capital of the depositors.Secondly  and as a condition for this financial merry-go-round  the harmful terms of the International Monetary Fund have been accepted  directing our countries* economies towards debt repayment.The letters of intent that express these terms are in fact letters of colonial submission to the prevailing injustice. While the richest countries close their borders  we must open ours  thus destroying our industrial facilities and indebting ourselves in order to continue to buy from foreign industry. A second factor of the letters of intent is the requirement that we devalue our currency in order to maintain the external competitiveness of our products; that  in other words  means that we are increasing the amount of work we must accomplish for the payment of our debt. The third factor stipulates that the domestic interest rate must be linked to devaluation  thus promoting inflation in a permanent vicious circle of unemployment and productive paralysis.The International Monetary Fund explains all these results as the consequence of excessive expenditures by the State and State participation in the economy. The Fund's final instruction is  therefore  fiscal austerity. Investments and social expenditures oust thus to cut back in order to guarantee the timely servicing of the foreign debt   These are how the letters of intent have been applied in recent years for the impoverishment of our peoples. As I have said  rather than being letters of intent these are in fact letters of colonial submission to injustice.Furthermore  we say that the International Monetary Fund does not have the moral authority to preach austerity in our country  because during the seventies  when it was necessary to place petrodollars in credits for poor countries  the International Monetary Fund promoted indebtedness. In those years  it encouraged waste and unproductive investments; it was an accomplice of excessive growth in public admire in is tradition. The International Monetary Fund  moreover  demands austerity only of the poorest countries; it favors the most powerful nation on earth. Since"" the non-convertibility of the dollar was declared in 1971  the United States has been the only country that has been able indefinitely to issue currency to cover its own deficits. What has been the role of the International Monetary Fund in adjusting the united States economy?As President of Peru  I announce that at the next meeting of the International Monetary Fund  in Seoul  we shall demand decisions on the reform of the monetary system and the distribution of world liquidity in a fairer manner. Otherwise  we are not interested in belonging  nor is it to our advantage to belong  to an agency that benefits a single country.We therefore reiterate that the International Monetary Fund shall not be the intermediary between us and our creditors. In the dialog with our creditors we shall not accept as a pre-condition the mortgaging of our sovereign economic independence nor the imposition of internal political conditions through the signing of letters of intent with negative terras for our people. I repeat before the whole world that my responsibility as Head of State is to the Peruvian people  that the Peruvian people is the primary creditor as far as I as concerned and that the Peruvian Government has been elected by the people  not by some financial cartel that wishes to satisfy its own appetite.In conclusion  we affirm that in current conditions the foreign debt - as a result of its unjust origins and because of the methods by which it has been increased - cannot be paid by any of our countries  because the effort to service it on time will keep our democracies trapped in misery and violence. Thus  we are faced with a dramatic choice: either debt or democracy. That is the crossroads faced by Latin America at present; that is the crossroads at which the poor world now finds itself. We must decide what road to take.We believe that the objective must be the unity of the debtor countries and a radical change in the present situation. To that end  we need to harmonize our positions with those of the countries of Africa and Asia  and to co-ordinate Latin American action. One hundred and sixty years of independent life in Latin America have shown us that the isolated development of each country is a model doomed to failure. None the less  we persist in our solitude. As in the title of the great novel  our countries have lived through 160 years of solitude. Exporters of commodities  purchasers of factories  debtors: we have continued on the same path  because the siren songs of the International Monetary Fund and of the banks beckon one and all towards isolated solutions which are only fading hopes or letters of intent that are immediately unheeded.We call for unity on the part of the Non-Aligned Movement and on the part of the Latin American countries  unity on this subject is a specific test for non-alignment  because political dialog will serve not only to deal with debt servicing but also to place the international economic order in a new context. Thus the debt which is the result of our weakness will be the instrument of our strength and an impetus to our unity. That is the great route to follow: unity. But Peru cannot wait for a series of meetings without concrete results. We shall not fall into the vicious circle of waiting for unity in the future and not doing anything until then. We do not believe in waiting passively; rather  we shall wait actively  not only by proposing the maximum of audacious actions but also be committing ourselves to a concrete struggle.Therefore  we have taken a decision that we shall maintain: Peru will assign to its debt only one out of every ten dollars  one tenth of what is paid to it for its work and its exports. This is a responsible and revolutionary decision  because it is the decision of a poor country that imports foodstuffs and industrial inputs  whose debt is with Western banks  and which has suffered and is suffering from the pressure by the International Monetary Fund. Our responsibility in this decision is to face up to its consequences.We do not have a privileged relationship with any Power  because we do not struggle against dependency by being the instrument of another hegemony. We do not adopt any spectacular positions  advocating non-payment while repaying one part of the world punctually  and repaying with strategic sovereignty a substantial debt that  for that reason  is not demanded under pressure by the other part of the world.We do not want  in a Messianic way  to export a 10 per cent model of payment. All we want to do is prove that a major step can be taken and that if many others decide to take it  we can open up the avenues to the future. In the future  if we unite  other solutions will also exist  but  between the rhetoric of great speeches and the realism of decisions  we have chosen the latter. For  if our relationship with the industrialized world is expressed through debt  it has its historical origin in the unjust difference between the prices of imports and those of exports.Today prices of copper  silver  fishmeal and oil exports are lower while real interest rates rise. We are convinced that by linking these two aspects we can change these asymmetrical relations. And this is the way in which we are staking on the future and setting our own terms of payment. If interest is the cost of money within a given term  then by seating a maximum payment the term is extended and by being extended interest rates are in fact varied.Someone has hastened to say that what  we are doing is accumulating more debt. But that passive pessimism does not distinguish between two different elements: that of the creditor  for whom interest accumulates  and that of the debtor  who by setting a maximum payment is laying down his own rules  independent of the accumulation of debt that the creditor presumes he has. This means that the uncertainty of the future becomes a problem for the creditor  rather than for us.Under traditional terms  in 1986 we should have to pay $2.4 billion to service the debt  plus $3.1 billion owed from the year before  which would in all represent a commitment of $5.5 billion payable in 1986. This amounts to 160 per cent of our exports  estimated at $3.4 billion for next year.In accordance with our decision  the maximum amount to be paid would be $340 million which would be allocated on a priority basis to the international financial agencies and to government-to-government credits  because we must achieve our economic autonomy. But at the same time we must accept the fact that we require a technological exchange with the world in order to support our development. And an important element of government-to-government co-operation and credits from international financial agencies  granted on favorable terms  is the fact that they must be repaid.Furthermore  Peru is a responsible country that does not simply blame its foreign debt on the international economy and the banks  we are a people seeking a revolutionary transformation and  as such  must make a critical assessment of our own history and acknowledge that due to a previous lack of unity and awareness and because we allowed ourselves to be dominated by groups linked to foreign interests  we have responsibilities that we must assume.When the time comes for decision  Peru will continue to maintain its aims until circumstances change  protectionist barriers are brought down  the true value of our exports is recognized  and we regain the fruits of our labor.I know that the response :o this decision may be the imposition of sanctions and amendments or  as has already been announced  that the Peruvian debt may be declared value-impaired in October. As President of Peru  I wish to say that it is not necessary to wait until October to declare this. The Peruvian debt is already value-impaired here and now. We acknowledge this. But what we should ask ourselves is how and.by whom was our economy impaired and what historical answer must we give to this situation.That is why our second objective is the complete democratization of our society as a way to resolve the crisis vf are confronting.We consider the human being to be use highest priority of society and state and we affirm that democracy should be initiated and based on suffrage and freedom of speech.There can be no democracy without participation. There can be no socialism without freedom. Universal suffrage cannot be replaced by a sectoral or corporative vote in the work place.Universal suffrage cannot be replaced by a Messianic attitude where one exponent becomes for decades the possessor of truth and history and dooms his people to disability and silence.Universal suffrage and freedom cannot and must not be sacrificed to the offer of bread that justifies dynasties and national mortgages.We firmly believe that it is possible to establish governments that are governments of bread and freedom and that a contrary attitude  whatever its motto or support  is nothing but tyranny.But we believe that democracy must also be based on an equal distribution of social resources  a harmonious development of regions and of economic sectors. Democracy must be an economic model that breaks through the vicious circle  that isolates a centralist industry in the face of marginal agriculture  in which millions of Peruvians are doomed to poverty.Democracy must be the universalization of the right to work  to health  to education  to participation. Democracy must be the genuine and only possible road to socialism. In this point the Peruvian Constitution is original. Where other constitutions begin by defining the state  ours begins by speaking of the human person.Front this standpoint  I wish to approach the second subject of my statement  the painful issue of terrorism and subversion  that in recent years has caused thousands of deaths  thousands of injuries and enormous material losses.While repudiating totalitarian and dogmatic terrorism  we also reject the concept that the means justify the and  since such ethics lead to the acceptance of the concept that might is right.We will fight subversion with resolute firmness but with respect for the law and for human rights. We acknowledge that subversive action has been possible not only because of lack of foresight and the absence of a well-planned social and economic policy  but because subversion has been nourished by the exasperating poverty in which millions of neglected compatriots are living.It is no coincidence that terrorism has arisen in the most economically depressed zones of the country. It arose in what we have called the Andean trapezoid  whose population has been subjected from colonial times to exploitative bGdSism and to a rigid centralist system. Millions of Peruvians were left mired in a subworld of oppression. United by the same language  mainly Quechua  united by the same culture - the Andean - and united by the same system of agricultural production  these Peruvians were neglected and injured by a state that never represented them.Ayacucho  the region where terrorism initiated its activities  is in that Andean trapezoid. In Ayacucho  out of every thousand births  over 270 die before the age of one  whereas the average in Latin America is 73 per thousand.In Ayacucho  74 per cent of the population is illiterate. In some places only one out of every hundred houses has water and only five out of every hundred has electricity.That is Ayacucho  the historic center of the peoples of America  where the great final battle for independence was waged. And it is precisely by taking advantage of such flagrant injustices that terrorism found a fertile ground for profiting from the despair of the people by pitting them  precariously armed  against the forces of the State. That is why we cannot pay the foreign debt at a rate in excess of 10 per cent of our exports; that is why we call for regional agreement in order to stop spending millions of dollars on weapons  millions that could save the neglected from poverty. For the incidence of terrorism and violence also feeds upon political circumstances  and in order to fight it we must understand it as not only the action of a Messianic and totalitarian group. We must take political action and make an effort to incorporate these millions of human beings .into civilization by establishing democratic institutions and a State presence and by reclaiming agriculture and considering farmers as the very sustenance of our nationality.Therefore  a close relationship exists between our economic history  our foreign debt and the poverty that promotes violence in the Andes. That is why I have dwelt at length on this subject  for in the case of my own country we may see the immediate future of other Latin American countries if poverty continues to increase and if advantage is taken of it by totalitarian and extremist forces.Thus  we are convinced that only a new international economic order can open the way for a lasting and democratic solution to violence. All of this  of course  must be accompanied by vigorous action that will firmly oppose subversives  but within the framework of law.Our bona fides of democratic introduction to the world is our respect for life and for the rights of individuals. Nothing justifies torture  disappearances or summary executions; barbarism must not be fought with barbarism.True  the action of public order against anonymous and collective subversion produces reactions of irrational aggressivity  but in no case can that justify the suppression of facts or permitting such acts to remain unpunished. That is why the Peruvian Government has taken drastic decisions in recent days. He will energetically defend democracy with the law and with social justice  in the conviction that we are acting in the name of life.Because we act in the name of life  we believe that politics must be an ethical reflection of respect and of morality. Thus far  the expansion of economic interests has governed the world  sacrificing peoples and individual human beings. Corporations  banks and super-Powers have oriented the world towards serving the needs of production and consumption because by controlling consumption and publicity human beings can be made to serve the logic of that economy.I should like here to move to the third subject of my statement: narcotics traffic as an activity that corrupts institutions and degrades man. We believe that drug consumption is but the exacerbation of consumption as a logic of capital. To consume  to consume to the point of self-destruction  is the caricature of the economic system. The same greed for profit that dehumanizes capital is reflected in drug addiction  that is  the consumption of dissatisfaction. Drugs are thus revealed to be a different state of consumer capitalism.The only raw material to have increased in value is cocaine. The only successful multinational business originating in our countries has been drug trafficking. The most advanced efforts at Andean integration have been made by drug traffickers. But to what is this due? According to liberal economic theory  production is regulated by demand  and it so happens that the main market is in the United States of America. For Peru  drug consumption is not a national problem  but X can say that  in spite of that  within the first 50 days of our Administration we have dealt the most successful blows.to the international drug traffic. Twenty-two airports  three helicopter landing strips  five long-range light aircraft  hundreds of kilograms of drugs and eight large factories have beendiscovered and seized. All of that means that the consumption of drugs in the United States of America will suffer a yearly reduction of approximately 80 tons  worth $5.6 billion. He could therefore ask the United States Administration  since we have done this in 50 days  what it is doing for the human rights of individuals who keel over in Grand Central Station and so many other locations. He might well ask when the United States Administration will act in a legal and Christian fashion to eradicate and condemn drug consumption here in the United States  which is the primary market thereby distorting our agricultural life.A liberal economist would recommend we keep our hands off this risky issue  but we believe that the State cannot be - indifferent to corruption and vice. That is why we consider the fight against drug trafficking to be our duty  because it is a crime against mankind. He are not doing it for the granting of a loan; we are not doing it to receive assistance of a few million dollars that is	usand that we will not accept in the future; we are doing it because our own conscience is enough to defend youth  whether Peruvian  American or.from any other part of the world.However  I affirm from this rostrum that another and equally serious crime against humanity is increasing in interest rates  reducing in the prices of raw materials and its wasting of economic resources in death-dealing technologies while hundreds of millions of human beings live in poverty and are encouraged to acts of violence.Lastly  I should like to refer to the position of Peru with regard to the rest of the world  which brings me to the fourth part of my statement. He are Latin Americans  and we are fighting for the integration of our continent in its anti-imperialist stance  because only in this way will we have a respected voice on the subject of the debt; only in this way will we be able to strengthen the multilateral treatment of the major problems facing the world; only in this way will we avoid the extension of the borders of the great Powers towards us.As a route towards that integration we support the peace efforts of the Contadora Group to safeguard the sovereignty and self-determination of the peoples of Central America  and as a committed continent we have  with other countries  constituted the Front for Support of Contadora  willing and united  ready to be present if a Power attempts to violate with its weapons the sovereignty of any country  for we understand that in that region the destiny of Latin Americans is also at stake.We affirm the need to strengthen the Andean Group  by working for a new and more up-to-date Protocol  and by proposing the expansion and more effective application of the Andean Reserve Fund  a financial organization which has already surpassed the International Monetary Fund in its disbursements within the region.We wish to enter into bilateral compensated trade agreements that could free us from the use of hard currencies  and affirm our economic integration. We have already taken the first steps towards an agreement of this type with Brazil.But one subject now stands out on the international scene  and that is the arms race. We are a peace-loving nation  respectful of international treaties  and we are not part of the arras race. We do not represent the strategy of any Power  nor have we been infected by the egocentric view of security that characterizes the big Powers. For them  their own security involves the insecurity of others  but the arms race results in the insecurity of all.That is the logic and the neurosis of the weak. We believe that the best defense is an affirmation of the nation as a people  and that the social requirements of our countries mean that we must limit our expenditures on arms. That is why we propose a regional agreement in Latin America for a substantial reduction of expenditures on weapons and will spare no effort to achieve this.I am convinced that more human beings have died because the money channeled into weapons was not used to help them  than the sum of all the dead from all the wars that have occurred in our history.Each bullet  which in 99 per cent of all cases is used in shooting practice  represents a food ration that could have been given to a child to save him from death. But today  the sale of weapons that swiftly become obsolete is a very important part of world trade  and that renewable technology involves not only competition between our peoples but also high earnings for the weapon-selling nations which are jointly responsible for the crisis  and for the arms dealers. These professional death dealers are the promoters of intrigue between our nations and spur on our rivalries.In this  as in other subjects  we have not limited ourselves to proposing collective action while waiting passively for a consensus to emerge. We believe in consensus  but we also believe in our own determination. The determination of each of our countries must be renewed: determination makes it possible for a country to set a maximum limit for debt payment; determination that compels us to subversion while respecting human rights; determination compels us to fight drug trafficking without asking for compensation. Determination also requires us to act. We have made a substantial reduction in the purchase of highly sophisticated war planes agreed with France. And  while we are not paying our debt  neither shall we use our money for the benefit of the industry of death. On the initiative of our own navy  we have dismantled war vessels  and our armed forces  in the context of a new world  are being oriented towards action for the development of the nation.We are moved by any fear of being weak towards others. We do not seek to arm ourselves and to achieve a false sense of power in regard to others. We have confidence in the peoples of the world. We do not feel attacked by anyone  and with that confidence  and sustained by our willpower  we are ready to take action consistent with the principles I have outlined.The poor peoples of the earth are not enemies to one another. But we do have a common enemy that has penetrated our borders and our history with poverty  with domination and with injustice. It is imperialism which divides us and which trades on our lack of unity.In the face of this imperialism  we affirm our participation in and identification with the Non-Aligned Movement  with its authentic and substantive originality because we are not instruments in the bipolar strategy of the big Powers.We do not believe our peoples can in any way benefit from the Manichean East-West conflict. The only result of this conflict of fundamentalist views  is the outbreak of limited conflicts in the countries of the periphery.We affirm the role of the principles of non-alignment maintained by Nehru  Tito and Nasser   and in Latin America by Haya de la Torre since 1924. He proposed as a principle of anti-imperialist action the integration of Latin America to build democratic socialism. On our continent  integration is the guarantee of nonr-alignment  which does not consist of freedom from one hegemony in order to sustain a natural alliance with the countries of the East.This is why I reiterate from this forum that we are poor but dignified people  free and ready to unite  and that in the face of the armed power and wealth of the super-Powers we exalt the moral power of justice.We call on a united Europe to reflect upon itself and to realize that it has more in common with the poor nations than with bipolar hegemonism. Europe is also a field of political and military strategy  its lands bristling with their own and foreign nuclear weapons; it is undermined by insecurity  and its economic development is  regardless of its own wishes  dependent on the technology and economic orientation of the great Powers.And in the broader framework of all countries  we affirm the interdependence of North and South. We believe that the strategy defined in the 1950s and 1960s has not been implemented  and is still confining itself to such traditional categories as South-East Asia  the Middle East  the North Atlantic and the Caribbean  thus ignoring the growing globalization of decisions and of conflicts.That is why we also address the peoples of the industrialized countries and of the major Powers  reminding them of our common humanity.And here I should like to present a greeting to the American people  to the people of Washington  Jefferson  Lincoln  Roosevelt  Kennedy and Luther King  and my tribute to its democratic conscience and the outstanding individuals here who understand Latin America and the Third World without any imperialist zeal.And from this rostrum we greet mankind  all mankind everywhere  particularly the poorest in Africa and in Asia  who use their consciences as weapons so as not to be the passive objects of an irrational course of history and.an irrational world.My greetings go out to those who raise their eyes to the future and to justice.We have come here to say that  in poverty but with dignity  Peru has begun to walk forward towards peace  independence and justice. In the name of the poor of the earth  in the name of God  because it is the hour for action and the time for resolve."
"98",5569,"PHL",40,1985,"I wish to convey to you  Sir  the felicitations and best wishes of 54 million Filipinos on your unanimous election as President of this historic fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Republic of the Philippines has had centuries of historical relations with the Kingdom of Spain. That is why we are confident that under your able and sagacious leadership the causes of the universal peace and development so vitally needed in our time will be further advanced this year. I also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  whom I had the pleasure of working with in Bandung  Indonesia  during the recent meeting to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Asia-Africa Conference.Since we began the general debate 17 days ago  14 Heads of State or Government  88 Foreign Ministers and 25 plenipotentiaries have stated from this rostrum their respective national positions on issues currently on our agenda. They have also articulated their visions of the future based on our common experience during the past 40 years as the united Nations moves inexorably forward to the next millennium.Like my predecessors during the past four decades  I will at the outset deliver the recurring opening salvo  so to speak  of our yearly policy statements before this forum  which is a resounding call to all nations to heed the universal clamor for peace and the rule of law in international relations. If the Philippines persists in its efforts to pursue the course of peace it is because we have suffered successive invasions and domination by many foreign Powers. That is why as early as 1935 we solemnly enshrined in our Constitution a declaration renouncing war as an instrument of national policy  and adopted the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of our land. In 1973 we expanded those noble objectives by proclaiming in a new Constitution our adherence to a policy of peace  equality  justice  freedom  co-operation and amity with all nations. Thus  it is inevitable that we share the frustrations of many of our brothers and sisters here present at the slow progress towards universal peace.The peace that we seek is not merely the absence of bi-national or regional conflicts but internal peace brought about by a universal respect for the right of sovereign States to equality and non-interference in their domestic affairs.Respect for Philippine democratic institutions was established freely by the sovereign electorate in free  fair  open and universal suffrage when we ratified our new Constitution  which created a republican parliamentary form of government  in 1973  when we voted for members of our parliament in 1978 and again in 1984 and when we re-elected President Ferdinand E. Marcos for a third term in 1981. The Filipino electorate will once again go to the polls in 1986 to elect their provincial governors as well as city and municipal mayors and council members and in 1987 to elect a President of the Republic. All we ask is scrupulous respect for United Nations resolutions and declarations on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States so that our people will be able once again to exercise freely their right to self-determination. Also  and above all  we call for strict non-interference in the problem of insurgency that has confronted our people since 1946. We should like to assure the General Assembly that  as in the past  the Filipinos are capable of settling this problem by themselves. There is no danger whatsoever that the Philippines will become a flash-point of conflict  as has been the macabre wish of the Western media during the past two years.While others have placed the entire responsibility for the awesome task of peace-keeping on the United Nations and condemned it for its apparent ineffectiveness  the Philippines would like to believe that the united Nations has done more than any past concert or collectivity of sovereign States. He have at least reined in the atavistic human forces eager to plunge the world anew into a cataclysm.True  there have been and are still ongoing regional wars and conflicts  but through the instruments and mechanisms that we instituted in the United Nations Charter we have effectively arrested their degeneration into more catastrophic proportions. Who will deny the pacific roles played by peace-keeping forces in Kashmir  Korea  Congo  the Middle East  Cyprus and Lebanon? There is no doubt that the conflicts that we have seen since 1946 would have deteriorated beyond rational proportions had it not been for the timely interposition of a United Nations presence.Indeed  as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization  we should consecrate a day to the memory of those who have dedicated their lives to the service of international peace  such as the late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold  Count Folke Bernadotte and Ralph Bunche - the first and third of whom were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  to their lasting personal credit as well as that of the United Nations  which they served valiantly. The labors for peace are unending. Let us not forget either that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) have similarly been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their contributions to eradicating the scourge of war.Therefore  I reiterate the almost universal call for the immediate and totalwithdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and full respect for the right of all Kampucheans to self-determination. Specifically  we call upon Viet Nam to demonstrate anew its commitment to peace and the rule of law by respecting united Nations resolutions on the peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean problem  particularly General Assembly resolutions 34/22  35/6  36/5  37/6  38/3 and 39/5. We appeal to all peace-loving States to continue their valuable support for the unceasing and determined efforts of all the Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - the Standing Committee of which the Philippines has the honor of presiding over this year - to restore peace  independence  freedom and justice to the suffering people of Kampuchea. For  as long as one nation is under military occupation  the ASEAN vision of making South-East Asia a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality will remain in the limbo of geopolitics.Let us make 1986 a genuine international year of peace in South-East Asia by our renewed collective demand for the liberation of Kampuchea from all foreign military forces before the close of 1985.Indeed  in our time precedents are not wanting for foreign military forces withdrawing unilaterally from parts of Indochina. Within the context of the principle that Asian problems must be solved through Asian solutions by Asians themselves  we in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are ready at any time to meet the Vietnamese and all concerned and interested parties  to discuss anything  to facilitate the speedy withdrawal of foreign military forces from Kampuchea. If we are to strengthen and give meaning to the united Nations as an instrument of peace  let us meet together now and preempt a bipolar solution to our regional problem - for it would be a serious blow to the sovereign rights of small States to have their fate decided by the big Powers.Along the same lines  the Philippines supports all moves towards detente  entente and co-operation in the Korean peninsula and hopes that this will eventually lead to the upgrading of the status of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from that of Observers to full Members of the United Nations. This move will not only lend substance to the principle of universality but will also enrich the United Nations by the contributions of 62 million hard-working Koreans to the maintenance of international peace  security and development.In Afghanistan  the continued presence of foreign occupation forces has likewise prevented the exercise of self-determination by the Afghan people and the restoration of their non-aligned status.In the Middle East  the oil lifeline of most of the world's energy deposits in the region remains in peril and could be cut off at any time on account of the continuing Iran-Iraq war. If this were to happen  the world would be plunged into a depression of unprecedented severity causing untold misery to mankind. We should like therefore to associate ourselves with all people of goodwill in the world who have called for a peaceful political settlement of this terrible war of attrition between two developing nations.The Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved. Israel remains in possession of Jerusalem and the territories it occupied in the 1967 war. On the other hand  the eight of Israel to exist behind secure boundaries remains unrecognized. In short  the issue continues to be stalemated and calls for imaginative settlement and initiative.The Philippines has always sought to promote the pacific resolutions of international disputes. In 1982  the General Assembly adopted by consensus the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes. The Declaration embodies the sentiments of most States to solve their disputes through peaceful means. This goal must be accepted without any reservations and must be internalized by the international community with the active support of the United Nations. It is our hope that the protagonists in existing regional conflicts will retrieve this valuable document from their files and give it their thoughtful and serious consideration - for  who knows  it might yet hold the key to honorable solutions to otherwise intractable conflicts.Besides these international disputes  the process of change within some countries has resulted in domestic instability which is promptly exported to adjoining regions.In South Africa  the policy of apartheid by that country which is offensive to the sensibilities of mankind  has resulted in untold sufferings for the majority of its people. Moreover  it threatens the stability of the whole region. On the eve of the International Year of Peace  we call upon South Africa to restore  to respect and to protect the fundamental rights of Africans and all Colored peoples in that tortured land. We also urge South Africa to heed the call of the international community for an independent and sovereign Namibia.The process of modernization has always been attended by instability  as old institutions are torn down and replaced by new ones. But in Central America this process has been complicated by the intrusion of big-Power rivalry in the process of change. It is time that the countries in that region were left alone to seek out their own solutions and their own approaches for the modernization of their respective societies.These political issues have been the continuing concern of the United Nations since its formative years. Over the years  international economic issues  which are just as destabilizing to world peace  have added a new dimension to global problems.Two decades after the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD I)  it is sad to note that the gap between the North and the South remains  worse still  it is widening. In a nutshell  the primordial concern of the third-world countries remains the question of how to reduce the time frame of their development to meet the rising expectations of their peoples.The pursuit of development requires massive infusion of investment funds. It cannot be denied that there is room for improvement on the measures which have been taken by some developing countries to increase domestic savings to finance their developmental needs. However  development projects require heavy foreign exchange components  in the final analysis  this requirement could only be met by making available adequate flows of foreign exchange to developing countries. This goal requires action on three fronts: trade  capital flows and official development assistance.Exports of developing countries continue to be hampered by tariff and non-tariff barriers in the developed countries. What is more  the developing countries are getting trampled upon like the grass because of the proverbial quarrel between elephants.Nowhere is this more evident than in the current trade wars among the industrial countries and the resulting surge of protectionism in some of these countries. While these protectionist measures by some developed countries are directed primarily against each other's trade  their impact on the developing countries will nevertheless be more devastating because of their fragile economies. The escalating war of protectionism among the industrial countries has literally crushed all efforts at economic modernization by the developing countries no matter how heroic they may have been. To us in the third world  this is more awesome than the threat of the so-called ""star wars"" because it has already brought about the impoverishment of our peoples.It gives us some hope that in the last Bonn summit the leaders of the industrial countries  realizing the dangers inherent in a protracted trade war  called for a new round of trade negotiations where the problems of the third world will also be addressed.My Government wholeheartedly supports such a proposal even as we express the hope that the industrial countries will redouble their efforts in implementing the results of past commitments under the multilateral trade negotiations.The decrease in petro-dollars has stifled the flow of capital to developing countries. Moreover  the continuing budget deficits in some of the major industrial countries necessitate massive borrowings in the world capital markets by these countries. The developing States are thus often faced with the unenviable task of competing with these affluent countries for scarce loanable funds in the world capital markets at interest rates and conditions that serve to aggravate their already disadvantaged positions. Indeed  the increasing debt burden of developing countries has become more onerous by inordinate interest rates and conditions. The United Nations cannot long ignore this problem for it could precipitate a global financial crisis unseen in the history of mankind.	International action is necessary to avert this looming catastrophe.The flow of resources to developing countries has remained way below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product arrived at by international consensus. On average  the donor countries have allocated only 0.4 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance. As of 1984  only four donor countries have met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target.The shortfall of funds needed by the developing countries to meet their national development goals is a continuing crisis  and unless some drastic measures are taken the goal envisaged in the United Nations Charter of a peaceful and prosperous world will remain unfulfilled. New and bold initiatives are needed for resolving the issue. In this respect  it is high time the developed countries put a global perspective on some of their domestic programs to reduce the inequities in their respective societies  such as those which encourage investments in depressed areas. Typically  such programs consist of a package of incentives for relocating industries in those areas. These incentives could take such forms as lower income tax rates  low interest loans  free training assistance and the like. If the developed countries were to view the third world in the same manner as the depressed areas in their respective societies  investments made in the developing countries would then be entitled to the same incentives and investments as those made in those depressed regions. As an initial and minimal step  the developed countries could apply a lower tax rate to income derived from new investments in developing countries. This proposal would undoubtedly improve the flow of investments into the third world. The philosophy behind the preferential treatment given to investments in those depressed areas is based on the sound reasoning that ultimately such regions  once developed  would cease to be a burden and become contributors to the national well-being. There is no doubt that most of the developing third-world countries could contribute just as positively to international prosperity  benefiting everyone  if they were given equal incentives to develop.Since the major obstacle to the development of most of the third world is lack of sufficient resources  we view with encouragement the coming talks between the two super-Powers cm arms control. My Government hopes that these talks will result in substantive cuts in defense spending. These savings could then be used for development spending. It has been estimated that $900 billion dollars a year is spent on armaments by the whole world. Just a portion of this amount would go far towards accelerating the economic growth of the third world. Moreover  the world would experience a heightened sense of security through the mutual reduction of armaments.The striving for development is  unfortunately  based on material things. In fact  most of the parameters used as indicators of progress are based on material goods. However  as the developed countries have already experienced  development has its dehumanizing effect. We note this readily in the robot-like treatment of workers in the assembly line  or the often-noted phenomenon of an individual in an advanced country cut off from all his roots in an atomized and fragmented society.In the natural course of events man works to satisfy his physiological wants by the acquisition of material things; but  beyond a certain level of consumption  he seeks higher values in the form of psychic rewards or self-fulfillment. This drive for self-fulfillment can often be achieved only by a holistic development of the capabilities of an individual and of the various sectors of the community in which he lives. While the United Nations has rightfully been preoccupied with satisfying the material demands of the world  it is time we looked towards the future and defined those higher values which societies and man must seek as he strives for progress.It is within this context that the Philippines at the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly proposed the inclusion of an item entitled ""New International Human Orders Moral Aspects of Development"". It is the hope of my Government  in pursuing this initiative  that the world will look beyond the satisfaction of material wants  beyond the usual parameters of economic growth  and strive for the establishment of an international order which will consider man as the object rather than the subject of development.The United Nations is indeed beset with numerous global problems  as we have indicated; but in the long run the survival of this body will rest on the ability of each Member nation to maintain domestic stability. In our interdependent world  instability in one country can easily be exported to its neighbors.While the political reforms in my country that I adverted to earlier cannot by themselves ensure domestic stability  they will be meaningless in the face of widespread economic deprivation. Therefore we are happy to note that the steps we have taken during the past two years are now leading towards a complete national economic recovery. The economic slide  which just a few months ago was cited by critics of our Government as presaging the imminent economic collapse of our country  has been reversed. We achieved this dramatic turn-around by pursuing a policy of fiscal restraint and monetary contraction. Our rate of inflation  which peaked at 63 per cent in the latter part of 1984  has been reduced to around 12 per cent? consequently  economic productivity has been stimulated. By the end of this year we are confident that it will be down to a single digit level.On the fiscal side  we have reduced our budget deficit to 1.8 per cent of our gross national product. This reduced deficit was achieved by pursuing a policy of fiscal restraint on governmental expenditures. At the same time  we were able to collect more taxes by the efficient administration of existing tax laws and by broadening our tax base by eliminating tax exemptions.During the first six months of this year we experienced a balance-of-payments surplus of $2.5 billion. This figure is a dramatic turn-around from the $1.8 billion deficit we experienced in 1984 and the $2.7 billion shortfall in 1983. The deficit in our balance of trade has likewise decreased from $316 million in the first half of 1983 to $261 million in the first half of this year. We achieved this reduction notwithstanding the depressed prices for most of ourprimary export products. Our imports for 1984 were 12.6 per cent lower than in 1983.Recognizing the scarcity of foreign exchange at the moment  we have changed our development strategy from the establishment of capital-intensive heavy industries in favor of a more balanced agro-industrial development. Our policy of giving incentives to the development of export-oriented industries has resulted in the diversification of our exports. In 1960  for example  only 4 per cent of our total exports were non-traditional in the form of manufactured or semi-manufactured goods. By 1980 our non-traditional exports expanded to 36 per cent of our total exports  increasing further to 58 per cent in 1984. In our drive to increase our foreign exchange earnings to meet our developmental needs  we have also tapped other sources of invisible earnings  such as tourism and the remittances from our workers abroad.All these statistics on economic growth and recovery will be meaningless  however  if the wealth accumulated by a country remains concentrated in the hands of a few. Even more important than the increase in a country's wealth as indicated by the growth of its gross national product is the overriding question of how this wealth is redistributed. In other words  who benefits from this growth?Our recent performance on this score is noteworthy. The share in income of the bottom 60 per cent of the families in our society increased from 21.7 per cent to 22.9 per cent between 1981 and 1983  or by 1.2 per cent in two years.This incremental gain may not appear large at first glance. None the less its significance is not lost on our people. It confirms that the policies we have pursued all these years are headed in the right direction - towards the goal of an egalitarian and democratic society that we all envision for our people.The Philippines has managed to overcome all its problems owing mainly to the continuing partnership between our people and our Government in meeting challenges that threaten our national existence. The prevalent view during the last two years  fanned in no small-measure by foreign media  is that our Government has lost the confidence of its people and that our country is undergoing a crisis of legitimacy.It gives me pleasure to state in this august forum that the most recent poll conducted by the Businessmen-Bishops Conference  an organization known for its independent views  totally belies this claim. The results of its nation-wide survey revealed that 44 per cent of our citizens approved of the performance of President Marcos and that only 25 per cent were in disagreement; the reliability of this survey has not been questioned by the numerous opposition parties.Given the continued trust of our people in the ability of our present leaders to meet the continuing challenges of our time  the Philippines looks forward to the future with confidence.Our main goal remains that of development which  in the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI is the other term for peace. We shall pursue this goal  relying in the main on our resources and on the industry and innate ability of our people  through self-reliance. But we shall at the same time always consider ourselves as part of the global community. When President Marcos assumed the presidency of the Philippines in 1965 he ruled out an inward-looking and xenophobic approach to development. He selected instead a strategy that would link our national economy to the global economy.Consistent with this vision we have recognized the importance of foreign investments and we have correspondingly assigned specific roles for foreign participation in our development  as spelled out in our investment priorities program. We therefore look forward to sharing the benefits of international prosperity while contributing our own share towards its attainment.We shall pursue and achieve our development goals under a system of orderly change  which will not destabilize our society and  ultimately  those of our neighbors. In our interdependent world  instability in one country is transmitted quickly to other areas.President Ferdinand E. Marcos  in his book entitled The Filipino Ideology  said that""we shall continue to support the United Nations in the firm conviction that this world Organization remains our only hope for international peace"". Unfolding before us are new roles for the United Nations system as the world knocks at the threshold of the twenty-first century. Increasing international contacts and the growing interdependence of nations require new forms of co-operation even as new problems complicate the fate of humanity. The failures of old structures and programs open the door to the new age. The idealism of the young and their determination to participate in building a better world are vital elements necessary to strengthen the United Nations system and prepare it better for the widening dimensions of its responsibilities.The United Nations remains the primary guardian of man's universal conscience and the preserver of its ultimate significance. Despite its idealism  or perhaps because of it  this Organization is still mankind's best hope for peace and progress. As long as the United Nations exists  man's dream of and work for a world of peace  prosperity and freedom stand a better chance of fulfillment. It is infinitely desirable that we keep this Organization a living and dynamic body ever responsive to the needs and aspirations of mankind. We can do no less for our sake and for that of future generations.That is why I should like to end my statement with a quotation from our esteemed Secretary-General  Don Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has reminded us all that""great effort of will and intelligence is going to be needed to build a system which will effectively preserve peace and which will work in the interests of all peoples of this Earth"". May he therefore continue to persevere in his Herculean task that has been the dream of mankind since the dawn of civilization. Long live the United Nations."
"99",5629,"PNG",40,1985,"My delegation and I would like to congratulate you most sincerely  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this important fortieth anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly. In wishing you success in all your deliberations  I assure you of my delegation's support and confidence in you throughout your term of office.I wish to extend our congratulations also to your predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  on the matter in which he discharged his responsibilities and guided the deliberations of the thirty-ninth session.Ten years ago  when my country was admitted as a Member of the United Nations  my Prime Minister  Michael Somare  stated from this rostrum that our fundamental commitment was to the maintenance of peace and security throughout our region and the world. He also stated that Papua New Guinea would undertake to uphold the principles and purposes of the Charter. As our track record indicates  Papua New Guinea has lived up to its commitments. On this fortieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations  let me reaffirm Papua new Guinea's obligation and commitment to upholding the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.In his 1984 annual report to this Assembly  the Secretary-General stated that ""The original intent of the United Nations was to provide a framework in which Governments of different persuasions could  in their wisdom  work out solutions to international problems and  if necessary  together take action to put those solutions into effect rather than engaging in conflict"". (A/39/1  para. 2)The main purpose was  and continues to be  to unite our commitments and obligations to maintain international peace and security.Papua New Guinea  which last month celebrated the tenth anniversary of its independence  is a young  flourishing democracy whose Government is structured on the Westminster system. We have had changes of Governments  all through the democratic parliamentary process and in accordance with our Constitution.The Papua New Guinea Government's basic approach in the conduct of its foreign relations is one of active and selective engagement. Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have tried to strengthen and consolidate relations with countries with which we share important interests. An important aspect of this policy is Papua New Guinea's developing relations with member States of the South Pacific Forum and the Association of South-East Asian Nations  with member nations of the European Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement  with the People's Republic of China  Japan  the United States of America and the Republic of Korea.Papua New Guinea's relations with the island developing countries of the South Pacific are based on culture  ethnicity and shared interests. Co-operation with these countries is generally conducted through two regional organizations. They are the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Conference.In recent years  leaders of the South Pacific island countries have increasingly become concerned with certain regional issues which have not been given the necessary attention and the publicity they deserve. Pacific leaders realize that one of the best ways of tackling pressing issues of crucial importance to the people and countries of the region is by promoting regional consultation and co-operation.Our relations with the independent island countries of the South Pacific are among those of primary concern to us. We welcome increased  constructive participation in regional affairs by metropolitan countries with traditional ties to the region  as well as by Japan  China and South Korea. We are critical of Governments which deny the rights and independence of island Governments.Papua New Guinea  together with other South Pacific Forum countries  has long advocated a nuclear-free zone in our region. For several years now we have protested in the strongest terms possible at the French Government's nuclear-weapon-testing program on Mururoa Atoll. However  despite those protests  the French Government continues to conduct nuclear tests on Mururoa. Papua New Guinea strongly condemns this arrogant attitude and calls upon France to comply with the wishes of the people of the region.We welcome Prime Minister Nakasone's pledge that Japan will not dump nuclear wastes in the Pacific.Recently  with other members of the region  Papua New Guinea has signed a treaty that would make the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone.As has been expressed here on numerous occasions by Papua New Guinea representatives  we consider colonialism an anachronism of our time. We therefore find it disturbing that as long as 25 years after the adoption of the historic 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  19 Non-Self-Governing Territories and one Trust Territory continue to languish under this system of the past. Papua New Guinea believes that the people of dependent and Non-Self-Governing Territories must be given the opportunity to exercise their inalienable right to genuine self-determination.With regard to the special problems of small dependent Territories  they must not be denied self-determination simply because of their size  geographic location  population or limited natural resources  and it is for them  and them alone  freely to express the form they wish to adopt in order to achieve the objectives of resolution 1514 (XV).If dependent peoples are to be able to make an informed and reasoned decision on their political status  adequate political education must be conducted by the administering Power concerned to enable them fully to understand the options available to them  as well as the likely implications of those options. There must be a greater and more meaningful participation by the indigenous peoples in the affairs of their respective dependent Territories. Appropriate Administering Authorities should promote investment in self-help projects appropriate to the needs and resources of those dependent Territories. In this respect  it is essential that they review the use of transnational corporations in the economic development of these dependent Territories.While colonialism is gradually being phased out  certain parts and peoples of the world continue to be saddled with the burden of conflicting territorial claims by metropolitan Powers. Papua New Guinea hopes that the anguish and uncertainty of these peoples can soon be ended. We urge those responsible to resolve the difficulties in a manner that avoids a further impasse.In this regard  we remind those States disputing each other's territorial claims that they have an obligation to respect the wishes and well-being of the peoples of those dependent Territories.Like other independent Pacific island countries  Papua New Guinea is particularly concerned about the remaining dependent Territories of the Pacific region.We are indeed happy to note that after years of painstaking negotiations between the United States and the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia  a compact of free association  agreed to between the parties  ispending before the United States Congress for ratification. We urge the United States Government to honor the originally agreed arrangements under the compact that was negotiated and accepted by both parties.In contrast to the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia  a third political entity in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands  Palau  has yet to conclude an appropriate compact of free association with the administering Power. We trust that this impasse is only temporary and that both parties will soon find a mutually acceptable formula whereby Palauans will be allowed to exercise their inalienable right of self-determination at the earliest possible date.Papua New Guinea  however  stands firm in its criticism of any attempts by the Administering Authority to circumvent the Palauan Constitution for reasons ofpolitical expediency. We shall therefore continue to advocate respect by the administering Power for the provision in the Palauan Constitution which outlaws the entry of nuclear weapons into Palau.Of particular concern to us is Mew Caledonia  which presents a crucial and highly pressing decolonization issue that still remains unsolved. Since our independence 10 years ago we have felt obliged to support the aspiration to independence of our Pacific island neighbors. Our resolve in this respect is as resolute as it ever was. He will continue to persist in our endeavors to bring pressure to bear on France to grant the indigenous population of New Caledonia the genuine exercise of its inalienable right to self-determination. Until several months ago we had some reason to believe that France had a genuine intention to accord New Caledonians their inalienable right to self-determination.It is with the deepest sense of regret that I report here today that the French Government plans to boost its military presence in New Caledonia. It appears quite clear to us that the planned increase in the French military presence in New Caledonia proves beyond reasonable doubt the intention o£ France to maintain New Caledonia as a colony indefinitely.Papua New Guinea fails to understand why the French Government should make such plans while calls for the decolonization of New Caledonia and modalities for the exercise of self-determination by the New Caledonians are yet to be resolved.In the light of the events that followed the Territorial Assembly elections last year  this latest move by the French Government can only be viewed by Papua New Guinea as an act of intimidation of the Kanaks and as an effort to influence the outcome of any act of self-determination.We are encouraged  however  to learn that  despite an active campaign by the French anti-independence sector in New Caledonia  the Kanaks won three out of four regional elections last month. Nevertheless  the majority of the seats in the Central Congress are still held by those in favor of the French anti-independence settlers. This does not guarantee that New Caledonia will become independent in the near future.We urge the Administering Authority to make further arrangements  including appropriate electoral reforms  to facilitate the full implementation of united Nations General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). In this regard we call upon the United Nations to consider the applicability of the United Nations Charter and the historic 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in line with the recent Forum communique.Papua New Guinea shares a common land border with the Republic of Indonesia  which is an important member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The effective and orderly administration of the Papua New Guinea/Indonesian border is governed by the Basic Agreement on Border Arrangements  signed in 1979 between the two countries and revised in 1984. On the part of Papua New Guinea  the success of the border regime established under the Basic Agreement is based on good understanding and actively encouraged through a policy of independent neighborly co-operation between the two countries.This is not to say that management of the common land border has not been without any difficulties and problems. We have had differences of views on various aspects of border development and administration. However  our ability to exercise a high level of flexibility and mutual respect in trying to understand and appreciate each other's style of approach to solving border problems has contributed immensely towards minimizing the chances of their escalating into serious border conflicts such as have been experienced by others in similar situations.Papua New Guinea has developed close and meaningful relations with individual ASEAN member states. Our relations with ASEAN are unique  in that we are the only country that enjoys special observer status with ASEAN. We have actively sought co-operation with ASEAN and I am pleased to state that we have been invited to participate in selected technical and functional areas.Our relations with member countries of the European Economic Community (EEC)  Japan  the People's Republic of China  South Korea and the United States of America have markedly increased over the past few years. We welcome this increase in our relations with those countries and look forward to exploring new areas for co-operation.As a special observer vis-a-vis the Non-Aligned Movement  Papua New Guinea hopes to maintain an active outlook on matters that affect the interests of the third world. We have supported and will continue to support issues of major concern to less-developed countries that are advanced by the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement. We would like to record our appreciation to the many prominent leaders of the third world who have made a commitment to pursuing collective third-world interests.Once again the General Assembly is meeting at a time when the very fabric of international peace  security  stability and prosperity is being assailed by increased global disharmony and economic inequity. As the Secretary-General observed in his report  the past year has been a time of great-Power tension  of heightened violence in several parts of the world  of continued economic difficulties and of a deterioration of the situation in many developing countries.It is Papua New Guinea's view that the United Nations must produce a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. During the last two sessions of the General Assembly  Papua New Guinea supported resolutions which formed a basis for the development of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We will continue to lend our support this year. We would also like to see the United Nations mandate a working group of the Conference on Disarmament to allow urgent practical work to be done towards such a treaty.Respect for the national sovereignty of all States and for international borders is an important principle in international relations and must be upheld. The use of superior economic and military strength to invade small countries for the purpose of securing spheres of influence is a matter of the utmost concern to Papua New Guinea. We have witnessed a resurgence of this deplorable phenomenon in Kampuchea  in Cyprus  in Lebanon  in Afghanistan  in Angola  in Namibia and  most recently  in Botswana. Papua New Guinea strongly condemns the perpetrators of those outrageous acts.The Papua New Guinea Government condemns the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the subsequent installation of a puppet regime. We reaffirm our support for the principles embodied in the 1981 Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea.The Papua New Guinea Government firmly believes that the withdrawal of all foreign forces is necessary for genuine dialog.Papua New Guineas believes that the crisis in the Middle East can never be resolved unless the principal parties to those conflicts recognize that they all have a right to exist. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  to which Papua New Guinea subscribes  offer a framework for the settlement of the conflict.The question of Namibia has long been a focus of international attention and United Nations efforts. However  no amount of international censure of South Africa's illegal presence and activities in Namibia has elicited the right response from the Pretoria regime. Papua New Guinea has no reason to believe that South Africa has any genuine intention of implementing the united Nations plan for Namibia's independence  as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is the only internationally recognized formula for Namibia's independence. Papua New Guinea continues to support that resolution.In spite of the fact that the United Nations has declared apartheid to be a crime against humanity  South Africa continues to run its affairs on the basis of that obnoxious system. Papua New Guinea strongly deplores the current violence directed against blacks and extends its condolences to the innocent victims.Papua New Guinea welcomes the recent direct dialog between North and South Korea in the hope that it will lead to a reduction of tension in the Korean Peninsula. Papua New Guinea urges Members of the United Nations to help create a better political environment for a peaceful solution of the Korean question by encouraging both sides to continue the dialog.Papua New Guinea welcomes the adoption of the Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. However  we are disappointed that since then certain countries not only have sought to alter various fundamental provisions of the Convention but also continue to find reason not to accede to it. Of particular interest are the provisions relating to the exploitation and management of fisheries. Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency countries have been negotiating a multilateral fisheries access agreement with the United States.We are concerned  however  that the United States has been reluctant to recognize the rights of coastal States over highly migratory species within their 200-mile economic zone. Furthermore  past experience has shown that coastal States face a very real threat of economic sanctions by the United States for exercising their rights over their 200 mile economic zone. Papua New Guinea appreciates that there have been some changes in the United States attitude  and therefore  looks forward to an early  and favorable  conclusion of the above-mentioned agreement.Papua New Guinea recognizes that the recovery that has been under way in parts of the world economy has spread unevenly  and has by-passed entirely a large part of the developing world. In many developing countries growth and development have been severely hampered  and in some countries have halted altogether. Papua New Guinea is concerned at the very real risk of many more developing countries facing an unmanageable crisis of debt and development should the economies of the industrial States fail to achieve a lasting recovery.In this respect  Papua New Guinea welcomes the view expressed by the leaders of industrial countries represented at the Bonn summit in June that the prosperity of developed and developing countries has become increasingly linked and therefore we should all work together in a spirit of true partnership. Like other developing States  Papua New Guinea's economic prospects are largely determined by external economic factors which are beyond our control. Consequently the notion of true partnership in international economic co-operation has a very real meaning for our economic survival and the provision basic human needs.In this  the 40th anniversary of the United Nations  Papua New Guinea would like to urge all Member nations to give a real and practical meaning to that partnership  we need prompt and practical action now if we are serious about dealing effectively with the important challenges that confront us today. Some of the proposals for action include increasing the resources of and lending by multilateral institutions  strengthening commodity export earnings  moving decisively to meeting the Official Development Assistance (ODA) targets and ensuring greater and more secure access to markets in developed countries.The Papua New Guinea Government welcomes the commitment made by participants in the London economic summit last year and the Bonn summit this year to urge resistance to and reduction of protection. But  as I have already suggested  what we seek is prompt and practical action. In addition  the Government of Papua New Guinea has acceded to the Common Fund set up under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). My Government does not see why there is continuing- delay in bringing the Fund into operation.Papua New Guinea appeals to all Member States of the United Nations to show a greater degree of responsibility  commitment and dedication to the world community. As for Papua New Guinea  recent negative trends and developments have in fact increased the importance which we attach to the United Nations  and strengthened our commitment and dedication to its principles and objectives.The United Nations Charter commits us to preserving peace and fostering social and economic development. All we Member nations have undertaken to resolve our disputes peacefully and to respect the independence and territorial integrity of all sovereign States. This Organization provides the only universal framework within which we can keep those promises and pursue those vital ideals and goals collectively.What better year to recommit ourselves to the united Nations than this year - the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. It is not going to be easy  but it can be done  and do it we must. We cannot hope for an equitable and peaceful world if we become complacent about the status quo. We must therefore put behind us our animosities and mistrust towards each other  and unite once more  as the founders did in San Francisco  with the common goal of preserving the United Nations as an instrument for peace and equity. Papua New Guinea believes that we are up to that task  for we are not only forty years older but  hopefully  forty years wiser."
"100",5675,"POL",40,1985,"The idea of the United Nations was taking shape during the life-and-death struggle against fascism. At that time I was a soldier at the battlefront. I remember what great hopes the Poles attached to the founding of the United Nations. We shared them with millions of people of the other oppressed nations threatened with extinction.The Charter of the United Nations inaugurated a universal international Organization which made its cornerstone the maintenance of peace  progress and the principle of equality in diversity.International opinion expects the fortieth session of the General Assembly  which is ushering in the fifth decade of our Organization  to write a lasting and creative chapter in the annals of the modern world.Will you please accept  Mr. President  sincere congratulations on your election to your high office. In your person I also greet warmly the people of Spain.I salute Mr. Javier Perez da Cuellar with esteem and personal satisfaction. It is fortunate indeed feat the Secretariat of the United Nations is headed by such a distinguished politician and diplomat.To tell the representatives of Mexico  the country afflicted by the recent tragedy  I say  ""We understand your grief. Please accept our heartfelt condolences.""Today  on the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the truth to which we must bear resounding witness is the anti-fascist  anti-militarist and democratic inspiration of our Organization  born of the common and  indeed  far-sighted vision of the leaders of the coalition of those days.The foremost ideal of the United Nations was  is and must remain respect for the equal rights of every people and every State and respect for obligations under treaties and agreements for constructive co-operation. Thus  anyone who now tries to rewrite history  who challenges the indivisible decisions of Tehran  Yalta and Potsdam  is in effect seeking to undo the achievement of San Francisco and is undermining the fabric of international confidence.The task of the United Nations is to work together towards the creation of a world in which ensuring the security of nations goes hand in hand with a multiplicity and diversity of social forms  political systems and cultures. The fact that world peace has been preserved for the lifetime of nearly two generations - that many conflicts have been put out and their internationalization has been averted - is due in no small measure to the existence and work of our Organization.Inherent in the Charter of the United Nations is collective acceptance of progress. In that respect  the United Nations has played an important role. It has contributed to the disintegration of colonialism. It has recognized racism in all its manifestations as a criminal doctrine. It has made a tremendouscontribution to the development and codification of international law. It has stimulated co-operation in the economic field and in the sphere of health protection  education  science and culture.Those are its fundamental - political and moral - credentials before the peoples of the world.Poland has been a steadfast advocate of strengthening of the United Nations system  its authority and effectiveness.Are we going to be the last generation that ensures the continuity of life on Earth? That is not a rhetorical question. Forty years ago mankind entered the nuclear era. Today  it is confronted wlCi the threat of the transfer of the arms race into outer space. Where this path will end is something that no one Is in a position to know.Contrary to binding resolutions  contrary to the universally recognized principle that outer space is the common heritage of mankind  barely a few days before the opening of this session there began the test firing of anti-satellite weapons against targets in the cosmos. That is an alarming example of discrepancy between words and deeds  between words of peace and deeds that threaten it.Poland has already on several occasions proposed that the General Assembly have recourse to the expertise and conscience of scientists. The result was thatat the seventeenth session  in 1962  the General Assembly  on our initiative  recommended the preparation of a report on the economic and social consequences of disarmament. At the twenty-first session  in 1966  Poland was the initiator of a report on the effects of the possible use of nuclear weapons  and at the twenty-third session  in 1968  it initiated a report on chemical and bacteriological weapons and the effects of their possible use.It would  now be desirable for a study to be prepared by eminent experts of different nationalities  under the auspices of the Secretary-General* of the diverse consequences of the militarization of outer space.We do not intend to oversimplify the question. Space research contributes to advancing various branches of knowledge and to technological progress. Polish scientists also contribute  to the extent possible a share of their own to research  pursued within the framework of the Inter cosmos organization. The solution to the problem does not lie in giving up space research. But the point remains to make sure that such research serves peaceful purposes only  that it serves the good of man.Armed conflicts still continue in different areas of the globe. People are dying. Their property is being destroyed. It is the duty of the international community to support the search for the peaceful and just settlement of those dangerous disputes.We are living at a fateful point in time. Recent years have made nations feel more insecure about their future and have aggravated fears of nuclear annihilation. Humanity craves a brighter prospect*  it wants understanding and peaceful co-operation. Poland is  and will continue to be  a fervent proponent of a return to detente in Europe and the world  which is still a realistic possibility. We consistently declare our readiness for joint co-operative action with every Government  every movement and every social force which wishes to see the world become a safe place for all.As part of the observances of the International Year of Peace proclaimed by the United Nations  a Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of the Peaceful Future of the World will be held in Warsaw. We expect it to bring together eminent persons in science and culture. Poland will welcome its guests warmly and with the respect they deserve.Prior to this session I invited the people of my country to comment on the issues they felt the Polish delegation should raise before this Assembly. That consultation has confirmed beyond all doubt that in their aspirations to lasting peace and international co-operation Poles are unanimous.No one has an exclusive claim to desires for peace. There are  however  nations on which tragic history has conferred a special moral right and an inalienable obligation  to refresh memories  to warn and to urge sanity - our people is one of those. Even today  the wounds of the Second World War have not yet wholly healed among us. A woman who then lost her only son wrote to me: ""Drum in the message that  basically  what war means is the son of one mother killing the son of another"". We in Poland understand that too well. My own office is in a building in the basement of which Hitler's Nazis burned the bodies of nearly 3 000 Warsaw citizens they had shot dead.Public opinion in my country condemns the waste caused by the arms race. It refuses to reconcile itself with the reality of a world in which thousands of people die of hunger each day and millions have to suffer extreme poverty.Profound concern is aroused in particular by the fate of children in many countries. Poland  one of the founders of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and initiator of a draft convention on the rights of the child  fervently supports intensification of efforts with a view to saving children and bringing progress in primary health care  including universal immunization.The state of the natural environment also attracts serious attention. Many of my compatriots are pointing out that pollution is being transferred across State frontiers  without barriers or tariffs. New  more effective forms of international counter-action  on both a global and a regional scale  should  therefore  be established. This would be promoted by the acceptance of a universal principle of unrestricted flew of experience  licenses and know-how relating to the protection of the natural environment.I have also received other interesting letters and suggestions concerning the subject of the ecology. We shall duly transmit them to appropriate United Nations agencies.The leaders of States and Governments bear an enormous personal responsibility for the fate of nations and the peace of the world. The faster modern military technology becomes sophisticated and the shorter the time in which the final decision has to be made the greater such responsibility becomes. We trust that this extremely important problem will be given proper consideration in the work of the United Nations.A meeting is due to be held within a few weeks between the leaders of the world's two biggest Powers  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the President of the United States of America. It is universally hoped that it will tackle key issues of security and that a chance will emerge for the arms race to be halted. The premises for this to happen are there. Their significance has been further enhanced by the new  imaginative Soviet initiatives  including in particular the declaration of a unilateral moratorium on all nuclear explosions and proposals for international co-operation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space under conditions of its non-militarization. These initiatives have Poland's full support. We consider that all States can and should make a contribution to consolidating world peace and security and promoting awareness of the horrors of nuclear war and its global consequences.Poland  the initiator of the well-known Rapacki Plan  a country consistently active in the search for avenues of realistic dialog  will  at the appropriate time  be ready to come forward with proposals serving the peaceful interests of all the peoples of Europe.The concept of regional nuclear-free zones  already given effect in Latin America  and the intention of establishing a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific  as well as the concepts of similar arrangements elsewhere  cannot but demonstrate that opportunities still exist in the world today for constructive search and action  regardless of a country's size  system or membership in a military grouping. That is particularly apparent in Europe; for the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation was conceivable only because both East and West  having finally confirmed the post-war territorial order  agreed by common consent to proceed from acceptance of the principles of negotiations  non-interference and equal security.The Polish People's Republic regards the permanence of the post-war European order as the paramount pre-condition of peace. Renewing territorial claims and invoking chapters of the past which have been closed once and for all are a path to nowhere  a path futile and  most of all  dangerous.Of the 159 Members of the United Nations  more than two thirds are developing countries. Most of them are members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. This has contributed lasting and precious values to the history of this century. It was on its initiative that the United Nations took up the concept of restructuring international economic relations. The full sovereignty of nations over their natural resources has been recognized  and plans for a new international economic order have been mapped out. Poland  like other socialist States  has always stood on the side of legitimate aspirations.This forum has witnessed frequent discussions of the complex economic realities of the present-day world  and this has been demonstrated with unusual emphasis at the current session. The growing disparities in development  the new phase of protectionism and discrimination and the politicization of international economic relations cannot but be gravely disquieting. Tho economic weapon is more and more often assuming the role which  for different reasons  can no longer be performed by direct military interventions. My country was and continues to be made painfully aware of this. The Polish people  every Polish family  has thus been victimized. Severed agreements and illegal restrictions have aggravated the economic problems; they have resulted in enormous losses to us  equivalent to well over a half of Poland's foreign debt.The problem of international debt has now come into particularly sharp focus. The world economy has reached a qualitative: new phase. The situation of some developing countries can well be described by saying that they have become the object of a form of financial neo-colonialism. There is  therefore  real danger of the lasting economic decline of many countries  especially the developing countries. The recent meeting in Havana concerning the debts of Latin American countries aroused much interest. The problems addressed there deserve our attention. They are of concern to other regions as well.The world debt problem therefore calls for greater attention or  the part of the United Nations. In the considered view of the Government of Poland  it would be desire to establish  under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations^ an international debt and development research center. We believe that  in addition to eminent experts  representatives of Governments directly concerned could participate in the center's work. Should this proposal be favorably received  an organizational meeting of the center might take place in the former capital of Poland  the ancient city of Cracow. Its university  one of Europe's oldest  was attended four centuries ago by Nicolas Copernicus  who was not only -a pioneer of modern astronomy but also - what is less well known - the author of the first modern treatise on money.To us in Poland the anniversary of the founding of the United Nations also reflects our rescue from annihilation. Never  not for so much as a day  did the Polish people stop fighting; never did they stain themselves with a colaborationist government. We owe our salvation to the heroism of the Polish soldier on every battlefront of the war. But  above all  we owe it to the epoch-making victory of the great anti-fascist coalition and to the Soviet Union  whose price paid for the liberation of ""Poland are the graves of its 600 000 soldiers who fell on our soil.When the Charter of the United Nations was being signed obstacles of a formal nature precluded the participation of my country's representatives; there was only one empty chair  that with the name-plate ""Poland"". Yet even then we were there. The great piano virtuoso Arthur Rubinstein  who had been invited by the organizers to grace the memorable occasion with his talent  began his recital by playing the 200-year-old national anthem  whose opening words are: ""Poland has not perished as long as we are still alive.""At no time has our country ever betrayed the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It has always been in the forefront of volunteers for peace. Never  not even in the most difficult moments  has Poland spared its efforts to contribute  to the best of its abilities  to furthering understanding and co-operation. Not for nothing  therefore  has Poland repeatedly been entrusted with an international mandate of confidence. Over 17 000 Poles have served the United Nations loyally and to good effect in its diverse peace-keeping operations. Even as I speak  Polish servicemen are performing the mission with which the United Nations has honored them in the Middle East.I should like now to say a few words about Poland as it is today. I address the representatives present here of those many States that have reacted to our difficulties with understanding  recognizing that Polish problems should be solved without any outside interference  by Poles themselves. To those nations and Governments I express our sincere appreciation.Let me also take this opportunity of turning to those who  out of prejudice and misinformation  ignoring obvious facts  continue to see Poland through a distorting mirror.Yes  indeed  we have been through a time of trial. Political realism and a sense of responsibility for the fate of the nation have nevertheless prevailed  and so has the awareness that Poland's stability is an extremely important factor for peace in Europe. The ostracism to which Poland has been subjected in certain capitals is one of those great mistakes which are a running theme in history and cast an ugly shadow over its pages.The right to judge is common usurped by those who in their own land would want law and order to prevail while in Poland they support anarchy and chaos. The reluctance  for so many decades  to condemn South Africa's regime  the support for other criminal regimes  the waging of an undeclared war against Nicaragua in defiance of the protests of so many countries - these credentials provide no right to pass moral judgments or deliver instructive lectures. I have not come here to put a gloss on our way of doing things. Contemporary Poland can only be understood by those who have at least taken the trouble to learn something of its history  of its exceptionally complex vicissitudes. My people  stripped of statehood for a long stretch of time  poor and economically backward  ravaged by wars and invasions  was brought by the Nazi occupation to the brink of biological and material extinction. The loss of our national wealth suffered during the war was  relatively speaking  25 times that of France and 47 times that of Great Britain  let alone the United States.Yet  despite those inconceivably deterrent circumstances  and in a historically brief period  Poland accomplished an immense task of reconstruction and made tremendous advances in its civilization. The socialist Polish State has sunk roots in the life of our people. Social justice has been elevated to become the cornerstone of the country's system. The law is equal for all. The constitutional guarantees of freedom of worship and diversity of philosophic outlooks are fully respected. The plague of unemployment does not exist. We have a comprehensive system of social security  free schooling at all levels  high standards of education equal to those of many of the most highly developed countries. Our rich national culture has been granted conditions for development and enjoyment by all. Its major achievements have been well known to many nations. For centuries Poles have shared with others the best of what they had to offer in learning and the arts. For centuries  too  they have drawn from the treasury of mankind's heritage. We will remain open  both today and tomorrow  to everything of genuine creativity and value in modern-day ideas and culture.The past has bequeathed my country its share of uncertainties  traumas and bitterness. But there is surely no country in the world in which all would be of the sane mind about all things. We are not shopping for compliments. He do not intend to saddle anyone with the blame for our own mistakes. He do not sweep difficulties under the carpet  be it from our own people or for the international community. But we reject using Poland for the ends of expediency or for vitriolic propaganda campaigns and we reject all forms of interference in our country's internal affairs as practices counter to the Charter of the United Nations  practices that impugn the dignity of our people.The worst of our difficulties are over. Perseveringly  step by step  we are moving forward. The plane of national accord is broadening; so is public endorsement of the policies of the State.We are consolidating socialist democracy. He ace attempting on original solutions; we make sure that they conform with universal values and  at the same time  with the record of historical experience of our people and the realities of our land.Poland commands a large intellectual potential  considerable industrial substance and sizable natural resources. He plan and program on a long-term basis. We are in the process of reforming industrial management systems as well as that of the performance of the economy and the State. He are banking on growth effectiveness  on scientific and technological progress  on initiative.This is the course we are following side by side with the entire socialist community. By the same token  we wish to develop good relations with other countries and to expand mutually beneficial co-operation with them. He are and shall always be partners of goodwill in the international community.Poland threatens no one. Reasonably enough  it expects that it too will be threatened by no one. Our homeland has been raised from the ashes by the arduous toil of the working people. He have secured for it a worthy place in the family of nations  together with guarantees of independence and territorial integrity of a sovereign State. These are gains that no sensible nation would squander.He look at our past soberly. We look forward with confidence to our future.It is an honor for me to convey  on behalf of the Polish People's Republic  the assurances of high esteem to the peoples  States and Governments represented in this Assembly."
"101",5746,"PRT",40,1985,"Mr. President  as the united Nations celebrates the fortieth anniversary of its creation  I should like to convey to you the great satisfaction and the feeling of deep confidence it gives the Portuguese Government that the work of this General Assembly will be conducted by an experienced diplomat  whose brilliant career my country has witnessed through close  friendly and fruitful co-operation. Moreover  by your election the international community is paying a tribute to your country. The geographical  historical and cultural ties that closely link Portugal and Spain have now been given new expression in the accession of both countries to the European Communities  which will entail renewed co-operation and understanding between the two countries.Thus  Mr. President  you can be assured of the full and sincere co-operation of the Portuguese delegation in the fulfillment of your high mission.I should also like to express here our appreciation of the endeavors of your eminent predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  who represents a country with which we have close ties of ""friendship and whose commitment to the achievement of international peace and security  especially in such hotbeds of tension as the region of southern Africa  we deeply appreciate.My country would also like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  whose constant dedication in difficult circumstances to the high office that has been entrusted to him deserves the full confidence and deep appreciation of all of us here today.I wish to assure the Mexican Government and the Mexican people at this painful time of the full solidarity of the Portuguese nation. Given the close ties of friendship that link our two countries  the Portuguese people have been particularly affected and saddened by the suffering and the mourning now beingendured by the Mexican people. I should like to express here the sincere wish and the willingness of my country to participate  both bilaterally and multilaterally  in helping to meet the needs and promote the reconstruction of the affected areas.It is a real honor for me to lead for the third time the Portuguese delegation to a session of the General Assembly  especially this year  when we are celebrating not only the creation of the United Nations 40 years ago but also the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly of a series of resolutions and declarations  including resolution 1514 (XV)  which have made a decisive contribution to the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination. My country attaches special importance to those decisions and in the last decade has felt partially responsible for them.Allow me to point out that this year Portugal celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of its admission as a Member of this organization. This is not the right place or the right time for a full analysis and assessment of the participation of my country in the activities of the United Nations during this period. It was only in 1974  with the establishment of democracy in Portugal  that we set aside the backward custom of taking refuge in concepts and principles that were clearly contradictory to those enshrined in the Charter. Only then did we putan end to our diplomatic isolation and begin to demonstrate by our actions a constant concern for respect for the basic principles set forth in the Charter  which are the moral and legal foundations of this Organization. We attach particular importance to recognition of the right of peoples to self-determination  respect for human rights and  lastly  respect for and promotion of the application of the principle of the prevention of the use or the threat of use of force in the settlement of international conflicts.We are fully convinced that these actions and motivations  which  furthermore  reflect the principles established in the constitutional law of my country  will be expanded and strengthened with Portugal's accession to the European Economic Community on 1 January next.European integration is a primary national project which has progressively won the firm and sustained support of the immense majority of all Portuguese political sectors. Underlying this consensus has always been the premise that Portugal  open to contact with other civilizations  is a country whose geography  history and culture remain basically European. Through its membership in the European Economic Community  Portugal is incorporating itself into a region that has often been a pioneer and is still a major stronghold of the basic principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of this Organization. Thus we shall contribute to the enlargement of the Community  as a regional and especially dynamic body  carrying out a thorough search for new forms of development and adaptation to the constantly evolving international scene. Portugal will be fully open to promoting  widening and strengthening dialog with other regions of the world  namely  with African and Latin American countries. In the light of this pledge  within the framework of the Communities  my country will become in the short term an increasingly important link in the relationships with those regions of the world. May I just mention  for example  the advantages which can accrue from the right use of the provisions of the Lome III Convention in the field of co-operation with African countries.With a special role to play in the North-South dialog  Portugal will certainly help to bring about greater sensitivity on the part of other Member States in the interest of the promotion and fostering of co-operation with Africa and Latin America. We may perhaps help to pave the way fox a new breakthrough  while participating in such achievement of the long-desired new balance c especially in the more sensitive hotbeds of international tension  thus establishing the necessary conditions for peace and development.Concerned as it is about the North-South dialog  my country cannot but call the attention of its European partners to the meaning and importance of the concepts that have inspired the Movement of Non-Aligned- Countries.A few days ago I had the opportunity of participating  as a ""guest""  in a meeting of Ministers of the Movement held in Luanda  a meeting that was a clear example of what I have just described.The conflicts and tensions that have beset the international community in our day  particularly the striking lack of progress in the achievement of harmonious relationships between the northern and southern hemispheres  have seriously impaired the socio-economic situation of the developing countries.At present  in spite of the slight improvement in a few industrialized economies  the impact of the world recession of the early 1980s still afflicts many of the third-world countries. We can see with great concern and distress that  in spite of its endeavors  the world still has a very long way to go before winning the battle against poverty.The roost serious consequences of this situation can be found in Africa  where the great majority of countries particularly south of the Sahara  are facing extremely acute economic problems  which have been exacerbated by continuing drought and desertification that have been worsening every year. The situation prevailing in Africa has brought about a greater awareness of the international community; that has been reflected in initiatives taken in all parts of the world  aimed at alleviating the more dramatic aspects of that suffering. My Government stresses on this occasion our appreciation of the efforts carried out by the Secretary-General within the framework of the United Nations to mobilize the Member States and to make the best use of the help that has been provided. We also pay a tribute to the Governments of the African countries  which have spared no effort in their struggle for the achievement of decisive  strong and long-lasting forms of development.In the past few years we have learned &:.at the world interdependence in which we all live requires the existence of solidarity among nations. And all the members of the international community  with no exception whatsoever  have to participate in such solidarity  assuming their respective responsibilities in the pursuit of a sustained and vigorous economic growth  and in the promotion of an international economic community in which realistic multilateral co-operation  geared towards action  should play a fundamental role. Portugal  as a European country at an intermediate stage of development  has speared no effort to shoulder its own responsibilities in this context.Furthermore  my country has also contributed to the search for solutions to the problems that beset the world economy  participating in different forums in an effort to close the gap that separates the third world from the developed countries and contributing to the creation of the necessary consensus on money and finance  trade  debt problems and transfer of financial resources.The world should spare no effort in the search for just and long-lasting solutions to the problems I have mentioned  problems that deeply concern the entire international community. The urgency of such solutions is clearly demonstrated by the negative effects that practically all these problems have in the field of human rights.The world is increasingly aware of the fact that the consequences of the violation of human rights and human freedoms have led in several regions of our world to social and political instability  often resulting in armed conflicts. The recent events in South Africa are a clear example of the violation of human rights in its ultimate consequences. But the same type of dangerous situation can be found in other parts of the world  where the violation of human rights is caused not by internal pressures such as apartheid but by external interference. The case of Afghanistan  with such great international political implications  can be clearly placed within such a contexts its people are still suffering from the presence of foreign troops with powerful and cruel means of repression and destruction.We are firmly convinced that only by applying uniform criteria can we make an analysis and assessment of the different types of violations of human rights which would make it possible to denounce and eliminate more or less covert cases of violations of such rights. We firmly believe also that this an imperative for overcoming the misleading concept that State sovereignty can be invoked to prevent international protection of human rights.Similarly  we are firmly convinced that in the final analysis international peace and security can be fully preserved only if they are based on social justice and on respect for individual rights. Furthermore  they should rest on the premise that the development of different societies and their adaptation to the requirements of progress and development should take place in accordance with the free will of those directly concerned. In this framework  full respect for the right to self-determination of the individual and of peoples is a key element of international life. Equally important is respect for the integrity of the human being  for his right to be granted civil and political freedoms and to enjoy economic  social and cultural living conditions which allow for self-fulfillment  without discrimination. Any disregard for these principles of international law  which underlie the United Nations  places the people whose dignity and integrity have been violated in inhuman environments and sometimes even makes them exiles in their own country  or often gives them no other choice than to renounce living in their motherland  thus forcing them to to take refuge in foreign lands.We should also pay special attention to all the different regions of the world where the human being is a prisoner of poverty. In an environment shadowed by hunger  illiteracy and the lack of minimum economic  social and cultural standards  civil and political rights can hardly be exercised in adequate conditions. The human being is entitled to development  and even though development must involve the entire international community  it is essential to bear in mind that man himself is the reason for such development and that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full participation of their respective populations in such a process  without any kind of discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors of society. In view of this  Portugal refuses to accept the lack of existence of a new international economic order as a pretext for the constant and systematic derogation of civil and political rights.""Participation  development and peace"" was precisely the theme of the world Conference to review and appraise the achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  held in Nairobi  with its important document ""Strategies for the Future""  the Conference made a valuable contribution to the search for the effective and equal integration of women in the entire gamut of activities both at the national and the international level. Portugal will constantly take into account the recommendations of the Conference in its endeavors to promote the full participation of women in national life.Full participation and equality are also the theme of the Youth Year that we are celebrating this year and that will give the United Nations and the Member States one more opportunity to reaffirm the importance of the dignity and self-esteem of all human beings  regardless of race  sex or ethnic origin.Portugal  as a country with a high rate of emigration  also intends tocontinue to participate actively in the activities of the working group of this General Assembly entrusted with drafting a convention on the human rights of all migrant workers and their families - a program which deserves our full appreciation.Before turning to another subject  and bearing in mind that the rights of peoples are a part of human rights  I should like to draw attention to the question of East Timor.In pursuance of resolution 37/30  adopted in 1982  the General Assembly entrusted the Secretary-General with the mandate of trying to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the problem of East Timor  since then we have given all our support to the efforts of the Secretary-General. The results of those efforts can be seen in his most recent progress report  which has just been published  in which he describes in detail the substantive talks that have taken place since November 1984 and during this year in New York between the Secretary-General and his representatives and the representatives of Indonesia and of Portugal. In these talks humanitarian  religious and cultural questions have been discussed and there have been accomplishments in the solution of individual problems such as the repatriation of former Portuguese civil servants. The religious freedom of the populations  the preservation of the cultural heritage of the people of East Timor and the social and economic living conditions have been given special attention. For our part  we have insisted and continue to insist on the importance of respect for human rights in the Territory since we believe that all our expectations in this respect are still far from met.We celebrate this year the fortieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations' and we have already celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on decolonization. The Territory of East Timor is on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. We firmly believe in respect for the fundamental principle of the self-determination of peoples  which is the core of the question of East Timor. Thus far  the right to self-determination has not been granted to the people of East Timor. And in this process of self-determination  in which the main beneficiary is precisely the people of the Territory in question  that people cannot be ignored when decisions are being made about its own destiny. We can say that the results already achieved in these talks are important  since such a wide range of problems has been dealt with  and we can only reaffirm here once more our support for the actions of the Secretary General in the fulfillment of his mandate.We have already made clear on several occasions what our goals are: that is  the search for a dignified solution that will allow for full respect for the religious and cultural identity of the people of East Timor; for the full satisfaction of their legitimate aspirations; for the improvement of humanitarian conditions and for total respect for their right to self-determination. We are open to concerted action  an essential element in the settlement of international conflicts. We sincerely hope that some of the results already achieved  and the settlement of further difficulties  will lead us on the only path that we consider viable  and that  as stated by the Secretary-General in his report  the present constructive spirit that prevails in the talks will allow us to move on to the next stage  where other questions should be discussed  keeping in mind the achievement of a ""just  comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement"".When referring to human rights  I cannot but recall that ten years ago these rights were clearly recognized and enshrined in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference  to which my country was a party and which convened together 33 States of different political positions which pledged themselves to the implementation of specific measures that would eliminate misunderstandings and violations of the . obligation of States to respect certain inalienable rights. An assessment of these developments has now been made in Helsinki  just as it had been before in Belgrade and in Madrid  to find out exactly how far apart are the theoretical commitments undertaken by States  the actual implementation of measures  and the achievement of practical results. Much to our distress  the conclusion was that the stage of implementation of the measures established in the Final Act was far from being reached. The same situation was noted again at the recent expert  meeting held in Ottawa on human rights and fundamental freedoms.Nevertheless  Portugal  which has fully endorsed the spirit of Helsinki  sincerely hopes that the next Conference in Vienna will make a decisive contribution to this process begun ten years ago.I should now like to refer to some of the problems affecting today's political world scene  that are matters of special interest and deep concern for my country.Portugal  as a European country which has close geographical  historical and cultural links to Africa  cannot but express its great concern at the recent events taking place in South Africa. These events  that have acquired increasingly worrying proportions  have justly aroused the indignation and condemnation of the entire international community.The position adopted by Portugal towards the problems that beset the populations of that country is well known to all  both within the United Nations and in the framework of its relationships with other countries  particularly our future partners in the European Economic Community (EEC). He clearly and decisively denounce and condemn the total lack of moral principles that characterizes all apartheid and bantustan systems  which sow the seeds of the serious internal strife with which we are all familiar. Portugal's staunch opposition to any form of racism or racial discrimination is a key element in our behavior and our understanding of the world. We thus consider inevitable  and it extremely urgent  that the South African Authorities should embark  without fear or hesitation  on a sincere effort to open dialog with all the different communities of their country  thus creating the necessary conditions for all its inhabitants to have equal access to political life  to freedom  to work and to social justice. Only after having achieved these conditions will the South Africans of any community be able to consider themselves free and full-fledged citizens of the South African nation.Thus  from this international rostrum  my Government urges the Government of South Africa to begin as soon as possible  with decisiveness and flexibility  an open dialog with the leaders of all the communities that are part of the country so as to strike a fruitful agreement.Similarly  I should also like to express to this Assembly the concern of my country at the delay in the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Namibia  as a result of the non-implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  in particular Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Portugal has paid special attention  and has always given full support  to the efforts carried out by the front-line States aimed at persuading South Africa to set aside its deplorable stance of confrontation - such as the recent invasion of Angola - and to take a constructive and flexible stand that would allow for a faster and more satisfactory solution of the problem. Thus  we not only hope that the South African authorities will decide promptly to work towards internal appeasement  but will also do everything in their power to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia  in full pursuance and endorsement of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The tense situation in the Middle East  a region to which Portugal is particularly sensitive  given its special historical and cultural links to the Arabnation  has not improved. On the contrary  it has not only persisted  but has even deteriorated.Let us consider the development of the situation in Lebanon alone  where the confrontation of rival factions has persisted with increasing violence  and where acts of terrorism are perpetrated at a dramatically growing pace against both national and foreign targets. Portugal has since the beginning supported with material means the efforts undertaken by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNXFIL) and we trust that the re-establishment of the necessary balance will lead to national reconciliation through dialog among the different Lebanese communities. For this to be possible  it also seems essential to us that all foreign military troops withdraw from the Territory unless the Lebanese Government explicitly requests their presence.We also believe that the solution to the crisis in Lebanon lies mainly in the achievement of peace in the entire region  and this in turn will depend not only upon the recognition of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine  including the right to self-determination and to a homeland  but also upon the recognition of the right of the State of Israel to its own existence and security.In this framework  the creation of a platform for negotiation between Jordan and Palestine is an encouraging sign. We believe it can make a positive contribution to a dialog among all the parties involved in the conflict. Another source of concern for my country is the prolongation of the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq  where the praiseworthy efforts of the Secretary-General and the repeated appeals of the united Nations have been unsuccessful in reaching practical results. In fact  the use of inhumane weapons has been escalating dramatically. Freedom of navigation in the Gulf is still seriously threatened  as are the economies of the two countries. The international community should therefore redouble its efforts to persuade the leaders of both countries to launch negotiations aimed at putting an end to the serious conflict.Portugal also views with great concern the development of the situation in Central America. My country firmly believes that the solution to the conflicts in that region must be found in an essentially regional settlement  through dialog among the various factions involved. That dialog should draw an equitable balance among the different interests in question that could lead to respect for the integrity of boundaries  to a decrease in the level of armaments and to the establishment of free and pluralistic societies.In this context I would like to recall that last September in San Jose  Costa Rica  my country participated in a meeting of the Governments of Central America  the countries of the Contadora Group  the countries members of the European Economic Community (EEC) and Spain. At that meeting the participating Governments studied means to reinforce not only political dialog among the countries of the region but also co-operation between those countries and the EEC at the economic and social levels.Portugal sincerely hopes that the nations of Central America will pull together all their efforts of negotiation within the framework defined by the Contadora Group  which has been joined by four additional democratic nations of Latin America  in order to reach a global solution that will at last put an end to the conflicts that harm them internally and that have been a source of division.In addition to the questions I have mentioned  I would also like to refer to the urgent need for the withdrawal of foreign troops frost Kampuchea and for the re-establishment of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. I would also like to refer to another situation that affects the stability of the Asian continent and that can be solved only through a dialog that will prove conducive to a peaceful reunification of Korea. The entire Korean people legitimately aspires to be represented in the United Nations.This enumeration of some of the hotbeds of international tension and the observations I have just made seem to have a logical corollary  namely  that now  more than ever before  the international community should find ways to achieve a more peaceful and a more secure world. For this reason  in the context of East-West relations  my country considers of utmost interest the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to resume and proceed with the Geneva talks that have been placed on hold since 1983. Although we are aware of the difficulties such negotiations entail  we believe that the fact that they are being resumed is in itself extremely encouraging.Furthermore  Portugal  an essentially peaceful country  cannot help but be very interested in problems relating to nuclear and conventional disarmament and in the reinforcement of international peace and security.As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  I should like to reaffirm here my country's renewed confidence in the greatest international institution and in all its subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies. This pledge of renewed confidence is no more than the reflection of our belief that the Charter of the United Nations is the document that today best enshrines the highest principles of international law and that it will in the future be the instrument that will most faithfully reflect the ideals of universality shared by all mankind. Although the achievements and objectives of the United Nations have not matched the ideals of the founders of the Organization  it is nonetheless true that as the main  if not the only  representative of universality our Organization will  in the end  find the means to adjust to the diplomatic  political and spiritual requirements of our day. Portugal reaffirms and renews here at this time its confidence in the United Nations."
"102",5792,"PRY",40,1985,"I should like first of all to express on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay our most cordial best wishes to Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  representative of our motherland Spain  who is presiding over the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly  we are confident that under his leadership  the General Assembly will have positive results at this fortieth anniversary of the founding of the most universal forum in the world.We also wish to convey our greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  whose fruitful work enjoys my country's complete support because of his dedication and fairness in dealing with delicate issues involving world peace and the future of mankind.The adversity that has afflicted Mexico has aroused our complete sympathy and solidarity. In this difficult time  we are convinced that Mexico's traditional strength will prevail and enable it to erase the traces of this misfortune. As a member of the Latin American community  we offer our help  considering it to be a freely assumed obligation to stand by the side of our brother country  Mexico  in its time of distress.Paraguay is attending this gathering of nations in the same spirit as ever. We hope that our Organization will grow in moral authority  that it will be able to play an effective role in the maintenance of international peace and security and that Governments will entrust the world's future to negotiation and dialog  eliminating for ever military conflicts  which constitute a blot on mankind.We reaffirm our conviction that the negotiating power of the United Nations should be strengthened  because Paraguay hopes that the Organization will be the mandatory channel for settling the disputes within its jurisdiction. So far conflicts have threatened and erupted  and all the negotiations concerning them have taken place outside the framework of the United Nations  without regard for the Charter and the promises made here by Governments when they became Members of the United Nations.This year we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Emerging as it did after the profound anguish of the Second world War  our Organization has played a guiding role in the international sphere.Although there is need for improvement in its day-to-day work  a good opportunity is provided by this anniversary to point out the many achievements of the United Nations on the difficult path to peace and security.Paraguay has always respected completely the individuality and independence of all States. On the basis of strict reciprocity in that steadfast course of conduct it has demanded of others the faithful observance of the same principles. For that reason  in no circumstances can it ever accept interference by other States in affairs that are exclusively the concern of Paraguay and that should be resolved by Paraguayans alone.Paraguay maintains its constant position of principle. My country is a true democracy  based on a democratic multi-party and participative system with full enjoyment of civil liberties. Its Government has as its constant objective the development and progress of the country and the continuous improvement of the standard of living of its people. Whilst Paraguay experienced the pain and anguish of anarchy and of coups d'etat for decades  today it looks to the future with faith  because its Government's work is based on the peace of the nation and the stability of its institutions. The functioning and independence of the three state powers are a reality  and the work of progress of development carried out by the Government has been uninterrupted  nor does it have insoluble problems that could delay the progress of the country for the benefit of all Paraguayans and those foreigners that live among us.In my country there is full enjoyment of the civil and political rights enshrined in the most demanding international legal instruments. Likewise  aware of the importance of these rights for the well-being of man  my country is endeavoring  in all the international forums in which it participates  to ensure full respect for them and it offers its sincere co-operation to that end.Paraguayan women have a most important role in our society. They are the ones holding together the family and fostering its development  and they have dynamically extended their role beyond the family. Being equal with men under the law  they contribute to the further development of our nation. The presence of Paraguayan women in all the areas of human life is increasingly felt in our society  especially in the administration of justice and in the field of education  a key activity for the future of all peoples  where their presence is even most influential in some areas. We are aware that our country can play a useful role in the promotion of womens rights throughout the world  and therefore we are prepared to serve as an example and to support all legitimate aspirations that may be reflected in present or future international conventions on that subject.My country has been the object of vast campaigns of vilification carried out abroad for unacceptable reasons. A short time ago one such campaign  which ran the gamut of international infamy  collapsed like a pack of cards  demonstrating that everything that had been said was merely the creation of distorted interests  designed to denigrate a country which is making constant progress and is living in peace and harmony with all others.My country  with the solid support of foreign technical co-operation  as well as with the support of international and bilateral agencies  has in recent years benefited from the most modern technology in all fields  especially in agriculture. There is no area of human activity which is not being provided with the constant and unquestionable support of the latest technology  making the physical development of the country a most important reality and bringing constant economic and social progress to the nation. We maintain a spirit of friendship and fraternity with all our neighbors. Instead of a philosophy of doubt and suspicion among friendly neighboring nations  we have chosen harmonious coexistence and integration  desiring only the progress of our peoples. Thus it is possible for us to give the world the example of the Itaipu hydroelectric plant  the largest in the world  which represents the splendid result of co-operation and understanding between the Republic of Paraguay and the Federal Republic of Brazil.This plant  which is producing energy for the development of our two countries and which will benefit the whole region  will this October set in operation the third great turbine  and on that occasion the President of the Republic of Paraguay  General Alfredo Stroessner  and the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil  Mr. Jose Sarney  will meet as a clear demonstration of the spirit of co-operation and friendship between our two peoples.The shared use and development of the Parana River does not end with the ITAIHJ dam. In the same spirit of co-operation and friendship  we are building  together with the Republic of Argentina  the YACYRETA Plant which  like the first plant I mentioned  will provide energy for a number of regions  cities and peoples in an electrification process that signifies progress and a vast socio-economic revolution.This governmental work has had a far-reaching effect on private initiative. There is a continuing increase in foreign investment in the establishment of major centers of agricultural production  and industry is becoming more flexible and seeking out the best technology. Meanwhile the State is making up for the lack of private initiative wherever the good of the country so dictates.Many issues before us deserve the special attention of the representatives gathered here. To speak of disarmament at the present time may even seem superfluous. Everyone is aware that the priority problem confronting the United Nations and endangering international peace and security is the unending arms race. Billions of dollars are spent on weapons  while millions of human beings are dying or living a marginal and subhuman existence through lack of food. The most serious and pernicious aspect of this arms policy is that it involves not only the great Powers and the industrialized countries but also to the developing countries  to the detriment of other needs that are basic to the development of their peoples.This crucial issue of the arms race is linked with another issue that endangers the very life of our planet. I am referring to the existence of nuclear weapons  to their increasing sophistication  and to the policy of many States which are trying in one way or another to join in a race which may lead us to a collective nuclear holocaust. It is essential that the nations which have no nuclear force and do not aspire to obtain it  but which undertake nuclear research solely for peaceful uses in development and in the health field  should have a guarantee of protection from the misuse of that scientific discovery that today threatens the very existence of the world in which we live.There are agenda items that remain relevant because of their implications and the political philosophy behind them. I refer here to the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In the first case a super-Power  which feels free to use the most outright imperialism in any continent of the world  continues to subjugate by force the noble people of Afghanistan  in defiance of all the rules of international law and of the ethics that should govern relations among States. In the second case  a neighboring country with military and all other types of support from that same super-Power has been subjugating the people of Kampuchea  denying it the exercise of its free will and self-determination.The conflict in the Middle East remains a matter of concern to all mankind. So many horrors have been committed and so much blood has been shed in that part of the world that it is essential for the United Nations  with the requisite support of the major Powers  to intervene and seek to establish peaceful coexistence among all the peoples in that part of the world  which deserves a better fate.There is a principle which is fundamental in our Organization - universality. In this respect  Paraguay supports the just aspiration of the Republic of Korea to be admitted to the United Nations. The Republic of Korea is a peaceful and hard-working State which maintains cordial relations with all countries.We should like to underscore the resolute efforts made by the Republic of Korea to seek unification of the two Koreas. In recent days these contacts have been fruitful and there seems every prospect that they will lead to a decrease in tension and promote a continuing dialog in good faith between the two sides. It is appropriate that the countries represented in this Assembly should support those steps towards reunification  which hold out the promise of being beneficial to peace in that part of the world.Just as it is the fundamental duty of the United Nations to respect the free and sovereign application of the principle of the self-determination of peoples  the principle of the integrity of countries is also part of the structure of international law and of ethical behavior among countries.Paraguay has always supported the process of decolonization. Our country  which was part of the Spanish Empire from which it obtained its independence on 14 and 15 May 1811  believes that at this stage in the life of mankind colonial possessions must disappear and yield to the self-determination of peoples and nations. However  sometimes  for political motives or for motives of world hegemony  decolonization is invoked in cases where the respective peoples  in free elections  have chosen a different course - as is the case of Puerto Rico  where the majority of its inhabitants have so decided.The conflict in Central America is of concern to the Government of Paraguay. Our country takes an optimistic view as it follows the efforts of the Contadora Group to achieve a lasting and stable peace  as well as to eliminate the root of the problem  in that strategic region - that is  the intervention of a super-Power from outside the continent through a State in the region whose aims constitute a threat to the stability and freedom of the American continent.We support a negotiated legal solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands  which remains a source of concern to the world public and a matter of considerable interest to the United Nations and the American continent. It is essential that a solution be found that preserves peace. The Republic of Paraguay with its pacific tradition and consistent solidarity supports any initiative designed to bring about a friendly negotiated solution  based on the principles of international law  to the sovereignty dispute a- connection with those islands.In this context  our country would welcome the resumption of bilateral talks between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom and the use of the Secretary-General's good offices.The war in the Persian Gulf is another source of concern to peoples and nations. How is it possible that no solution has been found to this conflict? The issue is a challenge because of the political and economic interests involved  but for that very reason our Organization should intervene firmly in the quest for peace.The same can be said of an age-old problem that has given our Organization much work: the question of Cyprus and its links with Turkey and Greece. Although this issue is not constantly in the headlines  it is a question that concerns all the citizens of our world who see the future of mankind in a constructive spirit of peace.Economic issues command our attention and today constitute truly serious threats not only to the development of peoples but also to the very existence of nations and the preservation of social peace.The most striking issue of the day is the foreign debt of the developing countries  which weighs on them like an unredeemable mortgage  since the amount of interest grows day by day and there are no resources from which they can be pay it  much less the capital involved.The problem of the foreign debt is no longer an purely economic question that can be resolved through normal banking channels or organizations linked to the development of our countries. It involves factors of a political and social nature that require the active participation of the United Nations in order that the rescheduling of the debt can be accomplished without infringing the rights of the developing countries or retarding their economic and social development process. We stress this  because the Government of Paraguay has taken steps to ensure that our foreign debt is controllable and does not become a burden on our national economy.The tariff and non-tariff barriers set up by the industrialized countries to exports from countries producing raw materials remain an obstacle to the right of the less developed countries to grow economically and thus raise the standard of living of their peoples.This applies to the Latin American countries which export agricultural products. Given the common interests of the highly industrialized and the developing countries in the face of world problems  greater understanding of this problem is needed to ensure normal  unimpeded trade based on a just distribution among nations and in the interest of the well-being of the peoples of the developing nations  which make up the immense majority of mankind.I need not stress the dramatic deterioration in the terms of trade between the countries that produce raw materials and the industrialized countries  while the latter increase the prices of their finished goods which are essential to the developing countries  the value of raw materials decreases  creating a balance-of-payments deficit  which is a sign of injustice and poor economic distribution.Experts on these issues have reaffirmed the justice of the cause of the countries that produce raw materials. Their conclusions are unassailable and irrefutable. Those countries have to send ever greater quantities of unprocessed goods to the major purchasing countries in order to acquire the products they need  and to do so at an  intolerable rate that affect the very existence of millions of human beings.Paraguay expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Development program for its co-operation in the various development programs undertaken in our country under its auspices. None the less  we regret that in each cycle the indicative figures decrease and for that reason opportunities to carry out new development programs are blocked. The solution is for the industrialized countries to contribute more generously to the funds of the United Nations Development program.Experts have estimated that horizontal co-operation among the developing countries is the best solution to the problem of technical assistance. This means that national experts or experts from relatively less developed countries can work in technical assistance programs. However  this system faces the same problem as we have just mentioned in connection with the United Nations Development program  namely  the lack of adequate financing to create fluidity. Logically  that financing should come from the highly industrialized countries. Financial support for that program would help achieve the figures required by the United Nations Development program in present circumstances.The Government of Paraguay welcomes the Convention on the Law of the Sea as a victory for all mankind. We are pleased that that Convention is being supported by more States and we hope and trust that its provisions will always benefit the less-developed land-locked countries.In order to resolve the problem of its unjust land-locked situation  Paraguay has from the outset of its independent existence waged a struggle for the free navigation of international rivers on the basis of accepted principles of international law and norms and the need of the land-locked countries to communicate and carry on their trade free from undue obstacles.The Government of the Republic of Paraguay is most pleased with the efficient work being done by the International Law Commission in expanding codification of all the practices and uses of international law. In this field anything that can serve to promote the codification of international law is an effective contribution to the free play of international relations in an orderly  just and egalitarian world.There is a scourge afflicting mankind in all parts of the world. It endangers daily life and leaves no one exempt from fear. I am referring to terrorism and violence  which have written the most painful pages of the history of our day. The boldness and daring of those who perpetrate this violence know no limits or moral constraints. Nations have not reacted firmly to this negation of coexistence. It is urgent that an international convention on terrorism should be concluded to put an end to this scourge  so that those responsible may find no sanctuary anywhere. The time has come to speak clearly and to say that terrorism exists in present circumstances because there are governments that tolerate it  that provide training for terrorists and serve  when necessary  as places of asylum for them.Paraguay repudiates violence and terrorism as inimical to religious and human values and to human rights  even though Paraguay has experienced no outbreaks of this criminal and murderous philosophy and is living in a climate of peace and work for the growing well-being of all its people.The right to social and economic well-being of a society can never justify the sacrifice of the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual. This is why we condemn totalitarian doctrines of any kind that repress those rights on the pretext of thus achieving alleged collective well-being.We must sincerely say that the world panorama today is not very comforting  nor do we foresee favorable solutions  at least in the near future  which would be to the satisfaction of the less powerful.The Republic of Paraguay places its trust in the moral authority of the United Nations in finding early solutions so that we bequeath to our children a world that is more free  just  equitable  humane and peace."
"103",5857,"QAT",40,1985,"Allow me at the outset to convey to Mr. Jaime de Piniés the greetings of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Al-Thani  Emir of the State of Qatar  and his hopes for his success and the continued success of the united Nations in its fortieth anniversary year. It gives me great pleasure to convey to him  in the name of the State of Qatar  my warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of this unique and historic session of the General Assembly that will commemorate the fortieth anniversary of this international Organization. His election is an expression of the high esteem and recognition that he enjoys as a result of his ability and long experience. It cWes me great pleasure to note the close relations  strengthened by historical ties  between his nation and the Arab States  which bind the two nations and the two cultures in a manner that sets an example to the whole world.I take this opportunity also to express my thanks and appreciation to his predecessor  who conducted the previous session with great ability and competence.I cannot fail here to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the efforts he has undertaken in the past year  as in the past  in seeking sincerely to promote the role of the united Nations and its credibilityamong the peoples of the world as it endeavors to maintain international peace and security and put an end to the regional conflicts that continue to cast a shadow over international affairs. We commend and fully support the Secretary-General's report to the session of the General Assembly on the work of the Organization.My country  moved by what the friendly people of Mexico have had to endure  takes this opportunity to express its deepest sympathy at this catastrophe and to reaffirm that the State of Qatar will stand by that friendly country as it weathers this crisis.For us  the celebration this year of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations implies respect for the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  together with cur readiness to participate responsibly in the affairs of the international community within and outside the international Organization. It is in that context that we fashion our co-operation with other countries at the regional  Arab and international levels.However  this celebration will not blind us to what  unfortunately  we see as the failure of the Organization to make its required contribution to the cause of international peace  as evidenced by its failure to find solutions to difficult questions which have been before it for a long time.However  while saying this  we do not in any way belittle the sincere efforts that the Organization and its Secretary-General have made and continue to make at different levels. On the contrary  this failure is a result of the denial of the principles of the Charter by certain countries  particularly the racist entities  and the disregard of the Charter and the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations by certain major Powers. This state of affairs prevents the Organization from taking the necessary measures that would lead to the resolution of international conflicts.The policy of alliances and division of spheres of influence followed by the major Powers  in addition to their occasional challenge to and denial of the decisions and resolutions of the Organization  even those adopted unanimously  have encouraged those countries to pursue policies that do not coincide with the interests of the international community. These hegemonistic policies have chipped away at the credibility of our Organization and diminished the role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. We must add to that the Organization's lack of competence in the area of ensuring implementation of the resolutions and decisions it adopts.The Palestinian question remains the perfect example of the disregard and obstruction of united Nations decisions by the racist Israeli entity  which enjoys unprecedented financial  military  diplomatic and moral support from the United States of America.A brief review of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations  both recently and in the past  reveals that the Israeli entity was established after the killing and dispersal of the Palestinian people. The evil of this entity  bolstered by its military machine and its policies of discrimination  persecution and expansionist hegemony  has spread to affect other Arab countries  including Lebanon and Syria. Suffice it to mention here the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor and the recent mad adventure undertaken by the Israeli entity  the bombing of a suburb of the Tunisian capital in an act of naked aggression and in flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter prohibiting the use of force and the violation of the territorial integrity of other countries.At a time when the Arab side has shown a sincere wish for a just and comprehensive peace  we find the Zionist entity persisting in its attitude of rejection and negation and placing obstacles in the path of all peace initiatives  no natter from what quarter they originate. The Zionist entity has gambled on imposing its policies of fait accompli. How else can we explain its destruction of Palestinian refugee camps  its grabbing of territory through force or forgery  or its intensification of the construction of illegal settlements on Arab territories  whether in the west Bank  Gaza or the Golan Heights?The Palestinian question is the core of the Middle East conflict. This part of the world will not know stability  but will continue to be drawn into conflict and instability and to face great dangers  until there is a just solution that returns the land to its legitimate owners  the Palestinian people  and restores all their rights. In our opinion  the responsibility of the international community  and the role that we hope it will play in ending Israeli arrogance regarding United Nations resolutions and the principles of international law increase as we examine the methods employed by Israel to deny the Palestinian people its historic rights and cultural heritage.These methods are shown in the attempt to erase the identity of the Palestinian people and to destroy its cultural  educational and social institutions  the closing of its universities  the expulsion of its teachers and lecturers  the detention of its students  the continuation of the settlement policy  the acquisition of territories through force  the expulsion of Arab families from their homes as has recently happened in Hebron  and the destruction of property and homes of all those suspected of resisting the occupation.The Israeli racist measures have included the imposition of curfews on Arab towns from time to time  campaigns of detention conducted at night against Arab youth  administrative detention for six months without trial and the recourse to expulsion from the country  as well as the throwing of citizens  including children  into detention camps.Furthermore  Israel continues its acts of destruction and manipulation in Lebanon  thus exposing its territorial integrity  stability and the unity of Lebanon and its people to untold dangers. The Israeli practices in southern Lebanon  whether acts of bombing  destruction  detention or military campaigns against the border villages  have become daily events in response to the heroic and legitimate resistance to the occupation by the Lebanese people.The State of Qatar calls for the implementation of the principles agreed to by Arab leaders at Fez during their 12th conference in 1982  as they constitute principles which complement and harmonize with the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations concerning the question of Palestine. The implementation of those principles and decisions  in the opinion of the State of Qatar  could take place through an international conference to be attended by the permanent members of the Security Council  along with the concerned parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.In addition to the Palestinian question  there is another question of extreme importance to us  which is the question of the security of the Arab Gulf and the related controversy concerning this issue. In our opinion  the security of the Gulf could be guaranteed when the major Powers abandon their efforts to intervene in the affairs of the Gulf.My country  a member of the Gulf Co-operation Council as well as a part of the Arab nation  is of the view that the people of the Gulf are the ones who are most competent to defend and maintain its security. Concerning the Iran-Iraq war  a war which has been raging in the Gulf for more than five years  we reiterate our rejection of that war and we reiterate our call for an end to it. As a matter of fact  we have called for efforts to that end because we simply do not understand such a war between two neighborly Moslem States  and because of our belief that political issues cannot be resolved through the use of force  as well as our belief that such a war poses a risk to the security and stability of the region and the world as a whole.Based on this position of responsibility we have supported the Iraqi initiatives  we have supported Iraq's readiness to engage in negotiations  and we continue to sincerely hope that the warring parties will give the mediation efforts a new opportunity to reach positive results that will put an end to the war and to the economic and human losses sustained by the Iraqi and Iranian peoples. Those efforts would foil the foreign interventionist designs and enable security and prosperity to return to the Gulf area  an area which is today facing many threats and practices beyond the constraints of international law.The State of Qatar views with increasing concern the events inside Afghanistan  because this is a neighborly Islamic country with common religious  brotherly and historic ties  and because Afghanistan constitutes yet another focal point of tension in our region  a region beset by crises.My country calls on the Soviet Union to respond to the international initiatives and efforts. We call upon the Soviet Union to put an end to the manifestations of its presence on Afghan territories  so that an end could be put to the current war and the Afghan refugees may be enabled to return to their homes and to normalize the tense relations between Afghanistan and its neighbors. We continue to hope that the Afghan people will enjoy complete freedom to choose its political system and to determine its own destiny.The current situation in Africa constitutes one of our major concerns  we sincerely hope that in the near future a solution will be found to the tension in the area and to the suffering of its people and that an end will be put to the repeated acts of aggression by the racist Pretoria regime against its neighboring States. My country strongly condemns the violent acts of aggression committed by that racist Government against Angolan territory. Qatar reaffirms its support and solidarity with the just struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as well as the courageous struggle waged by the national majority against the governing racist white minority in South Africa.It is the responsibility of all of us to mobilize international public opinion in support of the people of South Africa in its struggle against apartheid and for working towards the release of all political prisoners from the prisons of Pretoria. Those efforts must be aimed at enabling the African people to govern themselves and to implement their own policies. We call on the Western countries to change their conciliatory policies towards the Government of Pretoria and to abstain from extending financial  military and commercial support to that regime  in order to force it to abandon its policies of apartheid and repression against the struggling people of south Africa.We look forward with hope to the forthcoming summit meeting between the two leaders. President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev in Geneva. We call upon them  based on their respect for international peace  to put an end to the cold war between them and to the arms race and the threat of the destruction of mankind  symbolized by the ""star wars"" program. We sincerely call on them to work towards improving the chances for peace. We call on them to agree oil just solutions to the chronic and immediate problems that exist in all areas of tension  whether in the Middle East  southern Africa or Latin America  in order to serve humanity and international peace.The international economic crisis remains present in our contemporary world  and undermines the foundations of the developing countries in particular. Drought and famine have affected wide areas of Africa  while the debt and interest burden has increased to a point where the indebtedness of the third world has reached astronomical proportions. Meanwhile  the terms of international trade have deteriorated and the effects of the protectionist policies of the industrialized countries have manifested themselves very clearly. At the same time  the prices of primary commodities in the developing countries have increased at a time when the inflation rate has also been on the rise.The crisis in the economic situation as a whole  as manifested by the decline in the prices of natural resources  inflation and recession  requires further consideration of the need to resume the North-South dialog in order to reach an agreement between the industrialized and developing countries on the establishment of a new economic order or  at least  on improving the existing order. If that is done  a solution will surely be found to many of the economic problems that I have mentioned.Economic growth is the only means by which the developing countries can solve the problem of external debt. This problem has become the number one issue for developing countries  a problem which may lead to their financial collapse  as mentioned in the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development recently held in Geneva.In this context and in order to revive the development process  we are of the view that the developed countries must increase their imports from the developing countries  and that there must be a real reduction in the interest rates charged to the developing countries. We also note that there is an urgent need to increase the size of loans extended by multilateral financial institutions to developing countries and to open up the markets of the developed countries to the products of developing countries in the framework of a more open and stable trading system.On the other hand  the developing countries must adopt economic policies aimed at preventing any increase in consumption  while making sure that a major increase in investment can be achieved along with the creation of new job opportunities."
"104",5903,"ROU",40,1985,"It is a particular pleasure for me. Sir  to convey to you our warm congratulations and our best wishes for success on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fortieth session.At the request of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  I wish to set out the position  assessments and thoughts of our President and of Romania on some of the items on the agenda of this Assembly session.This year  the international community celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War  the bloodiest military confrontation in the history of mankind. It cost so many human lives and caused huge material destruction. Today when we examine the causes of that great world conflagration  it is clearer than ever that it was possible for war to break out because of a lack of unity and firmness on the part of peoples and realistic democratic forces in the face of the expansionist policy of fascism  which was aimed at world domination. He must never forget that the great victory over fascism was possible precisely because of the creation of a broad anti-Fascist coalition and because of the scores of peoples which were committed to the struggle and which rose up resolutely to defend their freedom and independence and to crush the Hitlerite war machine.Learning the harsh lessons of history  the world's peoples - including the Romanian people  which has been particularly active - have acted with firmness and have succeeded for 40 years in preventing the outbreak of a new major conflagration on our planet.However  it should be added that during the four decades since the end of the war  the international situation has been marked by a series of grave and complex developments which have given rise to mistrust and tension in relations among States. Although late last year and during the course of the present year some positive developments occurred  other developments in the international situation since the last session of the General Assembly show that the danger persists.Under these circumstances nothing could be more important than rallying the efforts of the United Nations  of all peoples and of all peace-loving forces to halt the dangerous course towards tension and war  towards the nuclear precipice  and to resume and strengthen the policy of detente  co-operation and peace. Thus it is more than ever necessary to act with all our might to defend the supreme right of all peoples to life  peace and a free and dignified existence. Pride of place in this effort belongs to the United Nations  which was created 40 years ago precisely to contribute to building a better and more just world  without weapons and without war.That is why Romania is committed to promoting a wide-ranging policy of dialog and international relations aiming at constructive solutions of the major problems facing mankind. This is a policy of principle  of broad co-operation with all States in the world  regardless of their social systems  a policy of supporting the struggle for liberation and national independence  and a policy which favors detente and peace. Romania has worked and continues to work consistently to base its relations with all States on the principles of full equality of rights  respect for national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  mutual advantage  and the renunciation of force and the threat of force  and to affirm those principles in international life. We firmly believe that only such a policy  along with close co-operation and a strengthening of the independence of every nation and of peace in the world  can guarantee the realization of the aspirations of all the world's peoples to freedom  a better life  and progress.This session of the General Assembly is taking place in a particularly serious and complex international situation. The arms race  first and foremost the nuclear-arms race  is reaching unprecedented proportions; this continues to increase the threat of another world war  which would inevitably become a nuclear catastrophe leading to the destruction of the very conditions of life on earth.Never in mankind's long history has such a threat hovered over civilization and over the life and freedom of peoples. Therefore  in the opinion of Romania and of President Nicolae Ceausescu the fundamental issue of our time is that of halting the arms race  especially the nuclear-arms race  and proceeding to disarmament  eliminating all nuclear weapons  ceasing all actions to militarize outer space  and defending and consolidating peace.The policy of force and the threat of force  and of consolidating and carving out spheres of influence continues with intensity. Armed conflicts and hotbeds of tension persist in various parts of the world. Moreover  the world economic crisis  which in one way or another has affected every State in the world  has further worsened the situation of the developing countries and has broadened the gap separating those countries from the developed countries.Since the 1982 special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  the situation in the field of weaponry has moved in a direction contrary to that advocated in the conclusions and documents adopted at that session and contrary to the legitimate hopes of peoples. The arms race continues at an ever more frantic pace; military expenditures have increased every year; efforts to develop and manufacture new types and systems of weapons  including nuclear weapons with ever greater destructive capacities  have intensified; and attempts are being made to militarize outer space.There has been a particular worsening of the situation in Europe because of the deployment by the United States of America of intermediate-range missiles in some Western countries and because of the consequent nuclear countermeasures taken by the Soviet Union.Like other countries  Romania welcomed the start of Soviet-American negotiations in Geneva. As is known  the two rounds of talks that have taken place thus far have led to no concrete results. During this period the deployment of new nuclear weapons in Europe has continued  and this has only increased the nuclear danger still further.An encouraging fact in this regard is constituted by the measures adopted by the Soviet Union regarding the moratorium on the deployment of some nuclear weapons until the autumn of this year and the cessation of nuclear tests until the end of the year  as well as the statement that if the United States of America were to adopt similar measures it would be possible to extend the cessation of nuclear tests and conduct negotiations with a view to the complete renunciation of such tests. We expect from the United States a positive reply to these initiatives and the submission of new proposals designed to reduce and then eliminate nuclear weapons and to halt the militarization of outer space. Mere statements are not enough; real  concrete actions are needed to prove the seriousness of the statements  to prove that there is a willingness to take the path toward the elimination of the nuclear danger.The fact that there will be a meeting next November between the General-Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  and the President of the United States of America  Ronald Reagan  is without any doubt a positive event. That meeting could  in Romania's opinion  promote the achievement of positive results in the Soviet-American negotiations in Geneva.We do feel  however  that halting the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race  and proceeding to disarmament requires that the European countries should not wait passively for the outcome of the Soviet-American negotiations and of the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Quite to the contrary  those States - and  in the first place  those that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization - must shoulder a greater direct responsibility and must intensify their actions to lead the two great nuclear Powers to act concretely to achieve a mutually acceptable agreement on nuclear weapons and on preventing the militarization of outer space and  as a result  to reach the appropriate agreements to that end during their meeting in November.It is in the interest of the peoples of the continent  and indeed of all the peoples of the world  to intensify the efforts and the actions designed to halt the deployment of new nuclear weapons in Europe and to proceed to the withdrawal of those already in place and then to the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons  to the cessation of nuclear tests and to the renunciation of any action towards the militarization of outer space.More than ever before it is now necessary that all Governments  all Heads of State  all political forces act before it is too late to save mankind from nuclear catastrophe.Romania is in favor of and acts resolutely towards the success of the work of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security-Building Measures and on Disarmament in Europe  and towards the beginning of effective negotiations to bridge the positions and reach an appropriate agreement. At the same time  we believe that the proposals made during the Vienna negotiations on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Central Europe are a good basis for ensuring without delay an initial agreement acceptable to all parties.In our opinion  the Geneva Conference on Disarmament must act constructively; it must consider the existing proposals with a view to overcoming the stalemate in the negotiations and achieving agreement on questions such as the prevention of nuclear war  the prohibition of all nuclear tests  the prevention of the spreading of the arms race to outer space  and the prohibition of the development and production of chemical weapons and the destruction of the stockpiles of such weapons.We attach special importance to the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the world as an important component of the policy of disarmament and security. In that spirit  we act to promote an active policy to ensure the broad development of relations with all Balkan States  both bilaterally and multilaterally  and the transforming of that region into a zone of good neighborliness  co-operation and peace  free of nuclear weapons and foreign bases. Similarly  we support the establishment of such zones in the northern and central part of the continent as well as in other regions of the world.To halt the arms race it is necessary to take consistent action for the freezing and reduction of military budgets. It must be understood that with the level reached by existing armaments the question of the lack of balance of forces is irrelevant. Balance must be achieved not through new weapons or new military expenditures  but through a reduction in the existing ones to the lowest possible level  and  in general  through the elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. We believe that on the basis of the decision adopted by the Conference on Disarmament in 1985  we can through common efforts contribute to the acceleration and then the successful completion of the process of the formulation of principles on the freezing and reduction of military expenditures  with a view to starting concrete negotiations to bring about international agreements in this field. Halting the arms race and proceeding to the reduction of military expenditures could create conditions that would make possible the allocation of large financial  material and human resources to the solution of the serious problems faced by the developing countries. That could not but exert a positive impact on the entire world economy  favoring the expansion of international co-operation and of economic and political stability throughout the world.In the general context of measures aimed at halting the arms race and proceeding to disarmament  we regard as of particular importance the cessation of the arms race in outer space. The misuse  without any control  of outer space -the heritage of mankind as a whole - is a serious danger for the peoples. We therefore think that it is necessary to stop any action designed to use outer space for military purposes  and to reach a general regulation of the use of outer space for peaceful purposes only. The question of the non-militarization of outer space must be solved appropriately within the context of the process designed to intensify international co-operation in the use of outer space for peaceful purposes. In the spirit of that position of principle  we support the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union concerning the peaceful use of outer space  including the convening of an international conference and the establishment of an international organization to that end.In the light of the importance of nuclear disarmament  of general disarmament  of ensuring peace  the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania recently addressed a further appeal to all responsible political elements and to the peoples of the entire world to combine their efforts and  irrespective of social systems or political  philosophical or religious convictions  to act - before it is too late -to put an end to the dangerous trend of events towards nuclear catastrophe  to save mankind from destruction  to ensure that our peoples and mankind as a whole have the right to free development and to use the discoveries of science and human knowledge solely for peaceful purposes  for the well-being  freedom  independence  and happiness of each nation.Romania   which is firmly in favor of reviving the policy of detente  believes that it is necessary to do everything possible to eliminate existing conflicts and settle all disputes between States solely through negotiations.Romania has firmly and consistently declared its support for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied since the 1967 war  recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to create their own State and guarantees of the independence  sovereignty and security of all States in the region. To that end  our country firmly and consistently supports the convening of an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  as well as the Soviet Union  the United States of America  and other States which could contribute constructively to the establishment of peace in that region. We feel that it is particularly important to enhance the role of the Secretary-General in the achievement of that goal and to involve him more actively in the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.The worsening of the situation in Lebanon is a cause of deep concern. We favor broad reconciliation of the internal political forces with a view to ensuring the unity  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.At the same time  we must express our concern at the continuing war between Iran and Iraq  which is causing both peoples immense human and material losses. We favor the immediate cessation of military hostilities  the withdrawal of troops by both sides to within the internationally recognized borders that existed before the outbreak of the conflict and the initiation of negotiations aimed at the peaceful settlement of the problems between those two neighboring States. This would be in the interest of the two countries and peoples and of peace and stability in that region and throughout the world.With regard to the Korean question  Romania reaffirms its solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its active support for the position and initializes it has taken and for its political and diplomatic efforts aimed at the peaceful  democratic and independent unification of the country.Romania actively supports the liberation struggle of the peoples and their efforts to consolidate their national independence and completely eliminate colonialism. In this spirit  we support the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  to gain their independence and ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).We strongly condemn the new repressive measures taken by the South African authorities against the black population and their blatant armed intervention and aggression against Angola and other neighboring States. We support the proposals of the African countries regarding the adoption by the United Nations of effective measures to put an end for ever to the racist policy of apartheid.Generally speaking  in the light of the numerous existing conflicts  which maintain and increase the seriousness of the international situation  we feel that it is high time for the United Nations to undertake with greater determination new measures and initiatives to resolve these conflicts by peaceful means  by negotiation.It is in this spirit that  on the instructions of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania we propose that the General Assembly of the United Nations address a solemn appeal to all States involved in military conflicts to cease hostilities immediately and move towards the solution of their problems through negotiations. We propose that with a view to the organization of such talks  the General Assembly request the Security Council to appoint special representatives. We propose  further  that all States should make a solemn commitment to comply with the obligation not to resort to the use or threat of use of force  not to interfere in any way whatsoever in the internal affairs of other States and to resolve all situations of conflict and tension by means of negotiations.The adoption of such an appeal and such a solemn commitment would testify to the political will of all States to respect the United Nations Charter and would be a clear contribution to the policy of promoting detente  improving the international situation  strengthening trust among nations and promoting disarmament  independence  co-operation and peace.There is deep concern at the fact that the world economy continues to be marked by instability and by a whole series of negative phenomena caused by the economic crisis  whose consequences are felt  to a greater or lesser extent  by all countries. The economic situation of the developing countries has been particularly affected by that crisis. The great majority of those countries find that they are prevented from developing their economies and advancing along the road of economic and social progress because of their external indebtedness and the extremely high interest rates which they must pay  as well as the protectionism increasingly practiced in various forms by the developed countries.As the Assembly knows  Romania has already put forward a series of proposals in this context. Romania  like many other countries  believes that in order to arrive at a global solution to the problems of underdevelopment  including the debt problem facing the developing countries  it is necessary to organize and begin within the United Nations genuine negotiations between the developing and the developed countries. Romania believes that within the framework of those negotiations agreement should be reached on a set of principles and arrangements for the global solution of the problem of the external debt of the developing countries  which would lead to: first  the cancellation of the debts of countries with a per capita income of $500 to $600  a large reduction in the debts of countries with a per capita income of $1 000 to $1 200 and a general reduction of 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the debts of all developing countries; secondly  the remainder of the debt being rescheduled on a long-term  not  as at present  a medium-term  basis  with a maturing period of three to five years; thirdly  interest rates being fixed at reasonable levels  while deducting from the remaining debt the excess payments made in recent years; fourthly  to the rescheduling of debts in such a way that the external debt servicing would not exceed 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the annual export revenues; and  finally  to the establishment  with the contributions of the developed countries  of a special fund from which to make new loans to developing countries at reasonable interest rates.The adoption of such emergency measures and the need to restructure the international monetary and financial system make it necessary to convene an international monetary and financial conference  as proposed by the non-aligned countries. The system conceived in the light of the conditions and interests that prevailed 40 years ago and on the basis of prewar experience has become obsolete as a result of the great political and economic changes that have taken place in the world.It is also necessary to restrain the present strong protectionist tendencies. Our country firmly believes that the developed countries should make a commitment not to introduce new restrictions and should adopt resolute measures to reduce and eliminate in accordance with a precise timetable those that are already in force. It is also necessary for all States to abstain from adopting for political or other reasons economic restrictions and sanctions incompatible with the norms and principles of international law and with the requirements of economic interdependence among all nations. Like other States  Romania favors the convening of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations aimed at the reduction of customs tariffs and the dismantling of non-tariff barriers.There is reason to recall also that  in our day  where a major scientific and technological revolution is in full swing  the developing countries find that almost all the channels of access to modern technology are closed to them- Finding ways to revive and .intensity the transfer of technology to the developing countries  increasing their access to the achievements of science and technology  would allow them to accelerate their development and their economic potential and  implicitly  it would allow them to increase  for the benefit of all  their own participation in the world economic system.The growing gap between the economic development and the prospects of the developed countries  on the one hand  and of the developing countries  on the other hand  makes determined action to stop the brain drain more imperative than ever. It is incumbent upon the General Assembly not only to keep this question before world public opinion  but also to work harder to build a framework for international co-operation which would avoid the harmful consequences of the drain of trained personnel from developing countries.To place international economic relations on a new  sound and fruitful footing and to overcome the instability which characterizes those relations  it is clearly necessary to bring about radical  fundamental changes which would do away with underdevelopment and establish a new international economic order  in keeping with the requirements of progress in today's world.The vital interests  present and future  of all the peoples of developed and developing countries urgently require that we give up selfish positions and get on with the settlement of these grave problems  while there is still time to control them and to solve them through talks. The dialog between the developed and developing countries carried out in a constructive  productive spirit in all negotiating bodies must be resumed as a matter of urgency and  finally  global negotiations must be started. Similarly  Romania has been and is in favor of a summit conference of the developing countries which would enable them to discuss ways of strengthening mutual co-operation and to develop a common strategy in their negotiations with the developed countries.One cannot truly overcome the world economic crisis and ensure lasting large-scale recovery  as well as economic stability in the world  without resolving the problems of underdevelopment in all their complexity. The actual start of talks to achieve new relations in international co-operation based on equality  equity and mutual benefit constitute an overriding necessity  a proof of the capacity of States to resolve this fundamental contemporary problem and to lay the foundations for widespread and sustained progress  in harmony with the needs and immense possibilities of the world we live in  and in harmony with the requirements of economic stability and international politics.Youth now represents an enormous social force for progress and peace which must resolutely have its say on all the major topics of international life. The young must above all act in close unity  side by side with their peoples and with the advanced democratic forces in the world  to curb the arms race and to achieve disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  in order to protect and strengthen peace.As builders of tomorrow's world  the young are deeply interested in participating actively and responsibly in the discussion and solution of all problems upon which their future peace  progress and well-being depend. Questions dealing with the removal of social injustices  with the guarantee of fundamental rights to work  training  culture and education are closely linked to the life at status of youth in society.Romania greatly appreciates the proclamation by the United Nations of International Youth Year  under the motto ""Participation  Development  Peace"". Itis an event of deep significance for the present and for the future of the younger generation in the world.We must act in such a way that International Youth Year will be an important factor in uniting young people of the whole world to defend and exercise their fundamental right to create a free and happy life for themselves and to develop in a climate of true security  co-operation and peace.It is our conviction that broad and representative participation in the United Nations World Conference for the International Youth Year  during this session of the General Assembly  will make it possible to debate the very substance of the major problems of the younger generation and to adopt  approve and implement guidelines for future programs devoted to youth  prepared by the United Nations Advisory Committee for International Youth Year.During this session we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  an event of such great scope and importance in international life. During the four decades of its existence  the United Nations has brought together almost all countries .In the world and has contributed to ensuring the necessary climate for peaceful coexistence and for the maintenance of dialog among States  in order to safeguard peace.This anniversary provides us with a good opportunity for a realistic evaluation of the activities of the United Nations and for identifying new ways and concrete measures to increase its role and its contribution to the solution of the cardinal problems of humanity.Increasing the contribution of all States to the debate and to the solution of the problems which concern mankind is an essential characteristic of contemporary political life. We see small and medium-sized countries  non-aligned countries and developing countries  all of which are highly interested in a policy of co-operation  independence and peace  asserting themselves more and more on theworld scene. It may be said that every State and nation whether large or snail  has a share in the responsibility for the fate of peace and of civilization  and its duty is to contribute to the cause of peace  detente and co-operation among peoples.The United Nations must faithfully reflect the realities of today's world  and it must truly represent a forum for the entire international community. It must . provide the necessary framework allowing all States to speak their minds on an equal footing and to decide on the fate of the United Nations and of peace in the world. It therefore seems necessary to improve the activities of the United Nations and of other international bodies  making them more democratic.Through the years  Romania has presented concrete proposals concerning fundamental guidelines for the activities of the United Nations. It has  with other countries  undertaken a series of initiatives to increase the contribution of the United Nations to the solution of current international problems and to strengthen its capacity for acting in harmony with the requirements of peace and security.We continue to attach the greatest importance to improving the machinery of the United Nations in terms of the peaceful settlement of disputes within the possibilities provided by the United Nations Charter. Romania has put forward  in the spirit of the Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes adopted by the General Assembly in 1982  the proposal to establish within the United Nations a commission for good offices  mediation and conciliation. It is a proposal which this year was studied in depth within the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on strengthening the role of the United Nations. I should like to make it clear that this proposal is not intended to create new structures  but rather to define  in complete harmony with the spirit and provisions of the Charter and within the functions of the principal bodies of theUnited Nations  a procedure within the Organization which would be permanently available to States and competent bodies of the United Nations  and through which interested countries could at any time go to a commission for good offices  mediation and conciliation  to settle conflicts through political means.Romania believes that in order to strengthen peace and security and cooperation between nations it is particularly important to develop and strengthen good neighborliness between States  the subject of an item that appears on the agenda of the present session  as a result of a proposal by our country. He consider that at the present stage of debate on the matter we should proceed  within a framework to be decided without delay  to identify and clarify all the elements of good neighborliness  with a view to the drafting of an international document of the United Nations.In our view  the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization can play a very important and useful role. We believe that the Committee could be used more efficiently than it has been so far in considering and adopting effective measures aimed at strengthening the Organization's ability to take action.In once again reaffirming Romania's deep commitment to the United Nations and to the purposes and principles of the Charter  adopted four decades ago  the Romanian delegation commits itself to work resolutely  in the spirit of the mandate given it by the President of the Republic  and in close collaboration with the delegations of other States  to contribute to the success of the present session  so that it may help bring about a turning point in international life  one that will make a change from tension and confrontation to detente and disarmament  to a policy of wide co-operation and understanding between States  so that reason and peace may reign on our planet."
"105",5949,"RUS",40,1985,"Sir  permit me first of all to congratulate you upon your election to the high post of President of the united Nations General Assembly for the fortieth session and to wish you success in your work.I should like to address the delegation of Mexico  whose country has suffered such a terrible natural disaster  entailing heavy loss of life and tremendous destruction  On behalf of the Soviet leadership and on behalf of all the Soviet people  we should like once again to convey to the Government and people of Mexico our most profound condolences.Four decades have gone by since the victory of the freedom-loving peoples over German fascism and Japanese militarism. The United Nations  whose birth was the natural result of that great victory and whose work has represented the world's major hope for preventing new wars  has now been in existence for 40 years.Today it can be stated with great satisfaction that those have been 40 years without a world war. In that period truly gigantic changes have taken place in the world. These changes include the establishment and development of the world socialist system - a system of States whose very political and social nature excludes the possibility of any interest in war. All the practical activities of the countries of the socialist community in the international arena are based on the policy of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems. The role of socialism in world affairs has been steadily increasing.Over an extremely short historical span of time the hurricane of the peoples' liberation struggle has destroyed and eliminated from the face of the earth the colonial system of imperialism. Over 100 new States have emerged from its ruins. Today they are full-fledged Members of the United Nations.The forces that are at work to strengthen peace and prevent war are constantly growing. At present their struggle involves people of all continents  of all generations and occupations  and with the most diverse political beliefs.The past 40 years have been a period of rapid progress in the scientific and technological revolution  which is not only drastically changing our concepts of the structure of the universe and of matter itself but is also creating ever broader opportunities for meeting the spiritual and material needs of every individual and of all mankind. Even today the achievements of science  if they are used for constructive purposes  make it possible to resolve almost any economic problem. However  they can also generate unprecedented dangers whenever they are used for developing means of annihilation and destruction.In the complex and rapidly changing world of today  which is the scene of a continuing struggle between the forces of progress and the forces of reaction  between the forces of the future and those of the past  the development of relations among States  including the major Powers possessing the greatest military potential  has followed s changing and at times zigzag course. Aggravations of international tension have alternated with periods when that tension abated; international crises have sprung up and have been overcome  some of them being so acute as to bring mankind to the verge of catastrophe. It would be fair to say that many a time when the international barometer has forecast a storm the United Nations has raised its voice in warning and has been able to take practical steps to reduce the threat.The greatest hopes for stable peace emerged in the 1970 s  which went down in history as the decade of detente. Detente was based on the general recognition that it was inadmissible in the nuclear age to seek to attain political and ideological goals by means of war and that the policy of achieving the military superiority of some states over others or of one social system over another was wrong and dangerous.The countries of the socialist community and many other States have every right to take pride in having been the architects and engineers of detente. Yet in the late 1970s and early 1980s the world once again witnessed a stepping up of the activities of the forces which never supported the policy of detente and are now seeking to undo its most important accomplishments. As a result  much of the system of international relations is out of joint and the risk of war has sharply increased.My delegation wishes to set forth the views of the soviet Union regarding the reasons for the current unfavorable development of the situation in the world and ways of remedying the existing state of affairs. It can be remedied only if there is an understanding  as has been pointed out by Mikhail S. Gorbachev  of the ""realities and the dangers which we will inevitably face tomorrow if today those who can and must take the only correct decision evade the responsibility incumbent on them"".We perceive the greatest peril in the fact that the nuclear arms race has  at it were  made a fresh start and is forging ahead. Added to this there is the threat of the arms race spreading to outer space. There is a great possibility of the arms race acquiring an uncontrollable and irreversible character. In the final analysis  this is the road leading to a nuclear catastrophe.It is also alarming that of late it has not been possible to settle a single regional conflict or to eliminate .a single hotbed of military tension. In the meantime the flames of ""local"" wars  more often than not undeclared  have been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands  and indeed hundreds of thousands. Mankind is suffering through being denied the opportunity to deal with such urgent problems as those relating to food  ecology  energy  population and the constantly widening economic gap between the developed and the developing countries. It has been denied that opportunity because the intellectual and material resources needed to find a radical solution to these problems common to all mankind are being squandered on the arms race.Not a single twist in the arms race spiral was initiated by the Soviet Union. It is only in response to actions of the other side and out of legitimate concern for our own security and that of our allies and friends  concern for international security as a whole  that we have developed or are developing this or that weapon system.Moreover  as early as 1946  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proposed that nuclear weapons should be banned for all time. We have been advocating this ever since  and this remains our position now. we have been proposing and continue to propose that agreement should be reached on renouncing all weapons of mass destruction  reducing and totally eliminating their existing stockpiles  and cutting down armed forces and conventional armaments. Our country has come out with a proposed on general and complete disarmament under strict international control.These radical proposals have yet to be implemented  and it is the United States and some other NATO countries  rather than the soviet union  that are to blame for this fact.It is precisely because of their refusal to follow the example of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China  which has also unilaterally pledged not to be the first to use nuclear weapons  that the threat of nuclear war continues to hang over the world.None the less  due to the vigorous efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving States a number of treaties and agreements limiting the arms race in major areas have been concluded. These are the 1963 Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear-Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under water  the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons  the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and the SALT I Agreement  signed in 1972  and the 1979 SALT II treaty. All these treaties  which have served in large measure to reinforce strategic stability  became possible because political realism was also displayed by the then leaders of the united States and other western countries.It is not the fault of the Soviet Union that local conflicts break out and are raging in various regions of the world. The only thing that we could be ""guilty"" of is that we have invariably been and remain on the side of the peoples threatened by imperialism and of the States upon whose sovereignty and generally recognized rights imperialism is encroaching.As regards the increasingly acute economic problems common to all mankind  the Soviet Union has consistently been in favor of uniting the efforts of all States and peoples with a view to finding a rational solution to those problems. This is the thrust of the proposals made by our country  by all Warsaw Treaty member countries  for a drastic reduction in the military expenditures of States  and above all of the major Powers.These are all facts  which cannot be disputed.Responsibility for the current critical state of international relations rests with another group of countries  namely  the United States and some of its closest allies.It was they who  in the early 1980s  wrecked the structure of negotiations which had taken such an effort to build  negotiations which had shown signs of progress towards agreements in many areas ranging from complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests to the limitation of sales and supplies of conventional armaments  from banning the development of anti-satellite systems to limiting military activities in the Indian Ocean. It was the united States that refused to ratify the SALT II treaty designed to pave the way to further  ever more substantial cuts in strategic arms. It was the United States that in 1983 torpedoed the Soviet-United States talks on the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe by embarking on the deployment of its new nuclear missiles on the European continent.And the new military programs which now cover not only the land  oceans and atmosphere of our planet but also outer space are United States programs too.No particular perspicacity is needed to see clearly that precisely those States that are obstructing disarmament efforts are also set on fomenting local conflicts. They bear responsibility for the failure thus far to come to grips with problems common to all mankind.All of this is being said not for the sake of polemics but in order that the United Nations may  on the basis of real facts and through concerted efforts  devise effective ways of radically improving international relations and strengthening universal security.What are these ways as we see them?It is said at times that all that is needed is that the two super-Powers should stop competing with each other for influence in the world. This proposition stems either from ignorance or from malicious intent. First  the Soviet Union has no intention of placing itself above other States and peoples  nor is it seeking opportunities to order them about or dictate its will to them. Secondly  the Soviet Union is not involved in any competition whatsoever  whether for markets  natural resources  control over sea or air routes  or the possession of outer space.On the other hand  it is of course true that the Soviet Union is one of the world's two most powerful nations. But the whole point is what political aims are served by that Power. Those who invoke the concept of the ""two super-Powers"" would ' be well advised to ponder once in a while what would happen to their independence and what turn world developments would generally take if the USSR were weaker than it is and if the Soviet people were not investing so such of their effort  material resources and scientific endeavor in maintaining its economic and military potential at an adequate level.In discussions about the ways of improving the situation frequent mention is also made of the need to restore  above all  confidence among States. This  it is said  would make it possible to resolve all major problems  including those of halting the arms race and settling regional conflicts. Indeed  confidence is an important factor in overcoming the current difficulties. We feel  however  that it is impossible to achieve a necessary and reliable degree of trust in relations among States unless the causes and the material roots of distrust are removed.But work to restore confidence must be pursued  and that is what we are doing. In particular  at the Stockholm Conference of states participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the soviet union is working for the adoption of a complex of large-scale  effective political  military and technical confidence-building measures. At Stockholm we are now prepared to proceed immediately  together with our negotiating partners  to the actual drafting of agreements to that effect. Our country attaches major importance to the pan-European process as a whole.The Soviet Union is building and developing its relations with all States in strict compliance with the Final Act and on the basis of the 10 principles proclaimed therein. It attaches special importance to the factor of confidence in those relations  and it is pleased when it sees that this factor is present in its relations with various countries in Europe  America  Asia  Africa or Oceania.In our relations with other States we have always given priority to the search for ways of easing international tension and averting the danger of war. Of great importance in this context is the forthcoming visit of Mikhail Gorbachev to France.We also want to build normal  stable relations with the United States. We have never been the initiators of confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. We do not believe that the tensions today in Soviet-American relations result from an inevitable clash of national interests. We therefore believe that both sides have an interest in the successful outcome of the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. This is precisely how the Soviet Union approaches that meeting. It remains to be seen what will be the attitude of the other side in this matter.We are convinced that the Soviet-American summit meeting should focus on the most important problem of the day  the problem upon whose solution truly depends on the possibility of decisively reducing the danger of war  restoring international trust and creating the conditions necessary for resolving many other pressing issues in relations among States. The problem I am referring to is that of preventing an arms race in cuter space and ending the arms race on earth  limiting and reducing nuclear arms and enhancing strategic stability. I will address this question in somewhat greater detail.To begin with  it would appear indisputable that as long as States possess nuclear weapons the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war cannot be completely ruled out. It is equally true  however  that in conditions of strategic equilibrium  that risk is comparatively lower  for strategic equilibrium means essentially that each side  even if it became a victim of nuclear aggression committed by the other side  would retain sufficient strategic capacity to strike an equally devastating blow to the aggressor. Consequently  in conditions of strategic equilibrium there could be no winner in a nuclear war and starting one would be tantamount to committing suicide.Yet the situation might change if one side should try to acquire such a nuclear potential as would encourage it to think that by a single strike it could deprive the other side of adequate retaliatory capacity against aggression  particularly if the potential aggressor should develop a space-based anti-missile shield and count on it to protect itself against a retaliatory strike. It is obvious that in such case the aggressor might be tempted to deliver or threaten to deliver a first ""disarming"" nuclear strike - as it is now known - counting on its immunity to retaliation. Hence the extreme danger inherent in any bid for military superiority in a nuclear age. Yet this is precisely the purpose of the new United States military programs  work on which has already begun or is about to begin.It could be argued that this is a purely hypothetical danger since the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it would not allow the other side to achieve superiority and would take appropriate counter-measures to restore the balance.But would that mean that the problem of the danger of nuclear war would simply disappear?It is true that our country would not permit military superiority over it. The State and Party leadership of the Soviet Union has instructed me to reaffirm this once again in this United Nations forum. Those who may expect that the Soviet economy would not be able to stand up to the strain of the qualitatively new stage in the arms race which is currently being forced upon us are profoundly mistaken. Our country and the Soviet economy have had to withstand even greater pressures. Today  the economic might of the Soviet State and its scientific and technological potential are such as to leave no doubt whatever in anyone's mind concerning the ability and determination of our people to meet that new challenge.However  it should not be forgotten that the higher the level of military confrontation in this nuclear and space age  the more shaky and the less secure  even if strategic equilibrium is maintained  become the foundations of world peace. Nuclear war in these conditions could result not only from a deliberate decision but also from attempts at blackmail or from miscalculation by one side as to the intentions or actions of the other. It could also break out as a consequence of someone's reckless behavior prompted by a sudden aggravation of the situation or because of malfunctions of computers  which are being increasingly relied upon in the operation of modern  sophisticated weapons systems.Such is our understanding of the current strategic and political realities. It is based on grim facts that cannot be ignored.It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union has been so persistent in seeking not merely the maintenance but a lowering of the existing level of strategic equilibrium and the early adoption of effective measures to stop and reverse the arms race. We know - and many other States now realize this too - that there is no more time to waste  for it may turn out to be too late.We have gathered in New York in the final days of the first month of autumn. It is a time associated in many countries with the harvest  when farmers look to the coming winter with a feeling of work well done. This thought brings to mind another metaphor which  regrettably  has already taken root in the vocabulary of mankind - the metaphor of the ""nuclear winter""  we want the word ""winter"" in all the languages of the world to retain its one and only meaning  its original meaning and to be identified solely with the season of the year which is so beautiful and joyful.In an attempt to establish a favorable climate for the resumption of the process of arms limitation and reduction  and  ultimately  the complete elimination of nuclear weapons everywhere  the Soviet Union has recently taken some substantial steps on a unilateral - I stress ""unilateral"" - basis. These steps include the decision not to place anti-satellite weapons in outer space so long as the United States does not do so. Unfortunately  however  the united States  disregarding the interests of political and military stability  recently tested an anti-satellite weapon against a target in space. Those steps also include the suspension of further implementation of our counter-measures in Europe consequent upon the deployment of united States medium-range nuclear systems on the territories of some Western European countries. Finally  there is our moratorium on nuclear explosions.It is clear that by their very nature such unilateral steps could not be taken as measures of unlimited duration; but they could be of unlimited duration if the United States followed our good example. That would constitute significant progress towards a relaxation of military tension in the world. If  however  the United States fails to heed the voice of reason  no one will be able to blame us when the unilateral moratoriums we have declared come to an end as their terms expire. It is not for us but for the United States to make the choice.Notwithstanding the importance of such steps as moratoriums designed to curb the arms race  the peoples of the world have every right to demand that radical measures be taken to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear - and not only nuclear - weapons.From the very beginning of the Geneva negotiations on nuclear and space weapons our country has been determined to achieve a radical solution to these interrelated problems and has taken a constructive position. The Soviet delegation had brought to the current round of negotiations substantial  large-scale and far-reaching proposals  we believe that agreement to ban space-strike weapons and to bring about truly radical reductions in nuclear arms would today have the most positive effect. Such an agreement could bring about a turn for the better in the entire course of world events  avert the threat of nuclear catastrophe and open up for the peoples of the world the prospect of a world free from fear for tomorrow. Mankind would be moving towards the new millennium which is already almost with us  confident that civilization would continue to advance.The Soviet Union has put forward proposals on the whole range of issues relating to the cessation of the arms race. I am not going to mention each of those proposals for all of them will  in one way or another  become the subject of an exchange of views at the General Assembly. Let me just say that they cover the nuclear field  including the cessation of nuclear tests  as well as chemical weapons  conventional weapons and the numerical strength of armed forces. In some cases it is a question of a freeze; in others of a reduction. The Soviet Union continues resolutely continues to support proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones  chemical-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world. It favors a limitation of naval activities and naval armaments and resolutely opposes the development of any new weapons of mass destruction.In the context of the proposed arms limitation and reduction measures  the Soviet Union believes it necessary to provide for adequate measures of verification and control  in some cases national  and in others national combined with international  whenever there is an objective necessity for this. We have as great an interest as anyone in effective verification of compliance by all States with their obligations in connection with disarmament measures. We call upon the States represented in the united Nations General Assembly  both members of politico-military alliances and non-aligned and neutral countries  to support this approach  which we are convinced is constructive and at the same time realistic.I would now like to offer some ideas as to what might be done to eliminate  through our collective efforts  local wars and conflicts  which result in untold suffering and innumerable casualties.Viewed in a purely United Nations context  the solution to this problem may seem simple. All that is needed is to compel all States to comply fully and scrupulously in their actions with their commitments under the United Nations Charter and equally firmly to deny support to those who violate those commitments.For instance  it is hard to imagine that any delegation would venture to assert here that the monstrous crimes of the Israeli aggressors on the ravaged soil of Lebanon and in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter or that the financing  arming  training and infiltrating into Nicaragua of thousands upon thousands ofcounter-revolutionaries - contras  as they are called - are consistent with those principles.Only chauvinistic arrogance could lead anyone to deny the Palestinian people their right to independent statehood while recognizing that right for the people of Israel. All peoples and nations have equal rights.Who is unaware of the brutal record of the South African apartheid regime  which is executing hundreds of the country's indigenous inhabitants and jailing thousands of others? Who is unaware of the acts of aggression it is constantly committing against Angola - as we see today - as well as against Mozambique  Botswana and Lesotho? It would indeed be blasphemous even to think that this inhuman regime acts in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. But it is a fact that the Pretoria racists receive support  and that this support comes from a major Power that 40 years ago was among the founding Members of the United Nations.Of course  expressing indignation at the crimes of the racists and condemning the aggressor does not in itself mean that those crimes will be eliminated. The peaceful settlement of any given conflict with full and just regard for the legitimate interests of all sides requires a political basis for a settlement which would not be prejudicial to those interests  as well as a negotiating mechanism appropriate to each specific conflict situation.Such political platforms for the just settlement of all or nearly all existing regional conflicts have already been or are being formulated. Suitable negotiating mechanisms either already exist or can be established.Let us now turn to the situation in the Middle Bast. The main parameters for solving the Middle Bast problem in a manner that would take into account the legitimate interests of all parties have long ago been defined. They include the return to the Arab States of all their territories occupied by Israel since 1967  the exercise of the right of the Arab people of Palestine to establish an independent State of their own and ensuring the right of all States in the Middle East  including Israel  to live in peace and security. A negotiating mechanism for such a settlement has long ago been proposed as well  namely  an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  and a number of other countries  including the Soviet Union and the United States.There may  however  be some people who think that the Middle East knot can be untied by separate deals  but experience has already shown that such actions can only result in aggravating the conflict instead of settling it. We believe that this year the Genial Assembly will take an even firmer stand in favor of an early and just political settlement in the Middle East  and will demand that those who continue to resist such a settlement should stop their sabotage.I should like to recall  in this connection  that Israel ewes its very existence to a decision of this organization  a decision which also called for the establishment in Palestine of an Arab State. It was a dual decision. The Soviet Union actively supported precisely that decision and  incidentally  it was among the first to recognize the State of Israel.In principle  a negotiating mechanism also exists for settling the situation in Central America which was indeed conceived by the Latin American countries themselves. I am referring to the Contadora group^ with which several more South American States  recently expressed solidarity. There is also a draft act of peace in Central America drawn up by the Contadora members. It is widely supported by the States and peoples of the region  including the Government and the people of Nicaragua  the country which is the target of the spearhead of imperialist aggression. It is important for the United Nations to support the efforts of the Contadora group and contribute to overcoming the resistance of those who  instead of peace  seek to restore their domination in Central America.It is also possible to break the deadlock in the Cyprus problem provided that an end is put to interference by imperialist forces and that the recognition of the independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Republic of Cyprus is laid down as a firm basis.I should like to make some specific comments about Afghanistan. A political settlement of the situation that has arisen around that country is also possible. What is necessary for this is that everyone should recognize the right of the Afghan people to build their life as they wish and that armed and other forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan should be ended. When such interference is ended  and if there is a guarantee that it will not be resumed  it will then become possible to withdraw from Afghanistan  by agreement with the Afghan Government- the Soviet military contingent. The sooner a political settlement is achieved  the better it will be for everyone.The proposals of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea provide a good political framework for building good-neighborly relations between all the States of South-East Asia  particularly between the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the States of IndoChina. The basis for such relations is gradually taking shape and the countries concerned are perfectly capable of establishing a negotiating mechanism. What is important is that no one should stand in the way of their wish to read agreement with each other.We support the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea designed to bring about the peaceful reunification of Korea and the demand for the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign troops as well as the proposal to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone.The question of the situation in southern Africa is an urgent one today. What needs to be done here is for the Security Council finally and fully to exercise its authority with regard to the racist South African regime  which  in violation of the United Nations decisions on the subject  refuses to transfer power to the Namibian people and poses a threat to the security of African States and global security.A quarter of a century has gone by since the United Nations adopted  on the initiative of the Soviet Union  a decision which has contributed substantially to changing the face of the world today  namely  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The work that was started then has now been almost completed - almost  but not entirely. There should be no room on our planet for the remaining fragments and hotbeds of colonialism. In this matter  too  the United Nations should speak out unequivocally and definitively. It is important that the newly free countries and peoples should be given assistance in ensuring their genuine political and economic independence.The United Nations quite rightly can and should raise its voice against the exploitation of developing countries by imperialist Monopolies  against the plundering of their natural resources and the strangling of their economies with the noose of indebtedness. Cuba and some other States Members of the United Nations have proposed ways of solving the problem of financial indebtedness.We support the demands of the newly free States for the establishment of a new international economic order on a just and democratic basis in accordance with earlier decisions of the United Nations and we also support their apposition to what is known as cultural and information neo-colonialism and all other forms of neo-colonialism.It is inadmissible that the States of Asia  Africa and Latin America should be regarded as a sphere of someone's ""vital"" interests  as an arena for confrontation with socialism. Those States are the influential Non-Aligned Movement and actively support disarmament  detente and the peaceful settlement of conflicts  which has mice again been convincingly demonstrated at the recent Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Luanda.The rights and freedoms of the individual are inextricably linked with the rights of peoples. The unique experience of our country eloquently testifies to this. Socialism has not only ensured that each and every citizen enjoys equal rights to work  housing  rest and pensions  has not only made it possible to obtain all kinds of education and medical services free of charge  but has also provided comprehensive guarantees of those rights. The standards of social justice were established in close co-ordination with the realization of the principles of self-determination of all nations and nationalities  including the preservation of their identity and the development of such national phenomena as language  literacy  literature and the arts.Thanks to the advantages of the socialist system  the peoples of the Soviet Onion  oppressed in the past  backward and divided  now stand together  united and therefore strong  and have over a historically short span of time reached the most advanced frontiers of economic development and created a flourishing spiritual culture and attained the heights of human civilization.We believe that this is the path that not only leads to economic and spiritual prosperity but also contributes to the building of trust between peoples and  on this basis  to bringing them closer together and concerting their efforts in order to attain the goals common to all mankind. That is how we understand the essence of the question of the rights and freedoms of the individual and peoples.The United Nations  by virtue of its Charter  must play an important role in encouraging and developing respect for human rights throughout the world. This provision  which laid the groundwork for international co-operation in the field of human rights  was included in the United Nations Charter on the initiative of the Soviet Union. Forty years have gone by since that time but  regrettably  to this very day flagrant  massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms are taking place. This is an inherent characteristic of a society where the power and wealth of a minority exist at the expense of the majority of the population. Such violations have become a norm of life in those States whose leaders are trying so hard to depict themselves as champions of human rights.I should like once again to draw members' attention to a problem  the solution to which will largely shape the world of our children  grandchildren and great grandchildren. I am referring to the problem of the peaceful exploration of outer space.Until only recently  space was the realm of science fiction  but it has now become a theater of man's practical activities. The peaceful exploration of space holds out for mankind truly limitless prospects of utilizing scientific and technological achievements to promote the economic and social progress of the peoples of the world and to solve the tremendous problems facing mankind on Earth.However  these truly cosmic dimensions - and here I am not speaking figuratively but literally - also present new requirements to the inhabitants of the Earth and above all to the leaders of States.There should be no repetition of the mistake made four decades ago when states and the peoples of the world were unable to prevent the great intellectual achievement of the mid-twentieth century - the release of the energy of the atomic nucleus - from becoming a means of mass annihilation of human beings. This is a folly which should not be allowed to recur at the end of this century when mankind  having filled the first pages of its space history  is facing a choice: space will either help to improve the living conditions on our planet or it will become the source of a new and deadly danger.In wishing to contribute to man's progress towards new heights of civilization  our country has taken a new initiative by proposing the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an item entitled ""International co-operation in the peaceful exploration of outer space in conditions of its non-militarization"".At the same time  the Soviet Union has submitted to the General Assembly specific proposals regarding the main directions  areas and principles of broad international co-operation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. Outer space is indivisible and all States should be able to take part in its peaceful exploration.This means that progress should be made by joint efforts in both basic and applied areas of space exploration  so that all peoples can benefit from space research. It is our view that such co-operation could best be carried out within the framework of a world space organization. And this could become a reality provided that all channels for the militarizing of the boundless regions of outer space are blocked off.To counter the sinister plans of ""star wars""  the Soviet Union is placing before the international community the concept of ""star peace"".The Soviet union hopes that its proposals will be carefully examined by the General Assembly.The Soviet delegation has set forth the views and proposals of the Soviet Union which we have found it necessary and timely to submit for the consideration of the United Nations. It is our hope that they will be regarded with understanding by all States represented in this Hall and by all the peoples which make up a united mankind.Much useful work for the benefit of peace and international co-operation has been done by the United Nations over the past 40 years. However  the united Nations has still a great deal more to do since it appears that we are now altering upon a most crucial period in the history of mankind  when it will have to take a decision on this question of paramount importances whether to live in peace or perish in nuclear war.In this regard  I should like to quote the following policy statement by Mikhail S. Gorbachev:""Our goal as we see it is to resolve together - for no one is able to do it alone - the major problems which are essentially common to us all: how to prevent war  how to end the arms race and embark on disarmament  how to settle existing conflicts and crises and prevent potential ones  how to create a world climate that would allow every country to focus attention and concentrate resources on finding solutions to its own problems - show me a country that has no problems - and how to join efforts in resolving global problems."""
"106",5996,"RWA",40,1985,"Ever since its admission to the great family of the United Nations  the Rwandese Republic has constantly been striving to the best of its ability to contribute to the tireless efforts aimed at consolidating and strengthening the credibility of our Organization and bringing about favorable conditions for the promotion and affective realization of the fundamental principles embodied in its Charter.Each year since 19 September 1962  the date on which Rwanda became a Member of this family - having regained its sovereignty  thanks notably to the impetus given by the United Nations to the decolonization process - my country has solemnly reaffirmed from this prestigious rostrum its commitment  determination and readiness to make its contribution to the task of building a world of peace and progress to which our Organization is dedicated.The commitment that Rwanda has made in this spirit was resolutely reaffirmed  on behalf of the Government and the people of Rwanda  by Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana  President of the Rwandese Republic and President-Founder of the National Revolutionary Movement for Development  who  speaking at the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly emphasized the overriding importance that our country attaches to the fundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. In this connection  he declared that Rwanda counts on the United Nations to channel and co-ordinate efforts aimed at building an international community that would be ""more just  more sound and imbued with a greater degree of solidarity"" (A/35/PV.12  p. 16)  our Organization being the ideal framework and the most appropriate forum for promoting the awareness of all the peoples of the world  by dialog and consultation  of a concerted harmonious approach dedicated to these efforts.In the same occasion  the President of the Rwandese Republic paid tribute to our Organization  calling to mind the achievements it had recorded since its creation. He thus voiced his deeply-felt appreciation for the role played by the United Nations in peace-keeping  promoting international relations based on equality and mutual respect among States  as well as solidarity and complementarity among peoples. The President of the Rwandese Republic stressed that this very keen appreciation went hand in hand with the satisfaction he felt in noting that the spirit which seeks to replace confrontation by concertation and exploitation by equitable sharing represents  without a shadow of doubt  an achievement that the international community owes to the efficacy of the United Nations.Recalling the analysis on which the President of the Rwandese Republic drew in his statement to the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly  I would emphasize that it is this very same analysis which underlies the tribute which  on on his behalf and on behalf of the Government of Rwanda  I am paying here to the United Nations on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary.This anniversary lends a very special importance to the current session of the General Assembly. It constitutes a major milestone  an event which will go down in the annals of our Organization  an event which we must observe in a very specific way. Indeed  it marks a significant stage  after 40 years  in a noble venture which is moving us closer towards the ideal which mobilizes and brings our peoples together  the ideal which was present at its creation.This is a very special occasion which affords me a special opportunity to renew our common faith in this ideal and our firm and unswerving commitment to spare no effort in the promotion of the goals that stem therefrom. At the same time  this fortieth anniversary offers an opportunity to take stock of what our Organization has done so as to be able to shape its future activities in the light of the challenges that it must  as in the past  enable us to meet. These challenges imply the need to remain active and vigilant  so that peace  the result of order based cm justice  can be consolidated and strengthened.We must  within our great United Nations family  strive to make this fortieth anniversary a turning-point at which  more than in the past  the determination to act in concert becomes apparent so that this decisive stage in the life of our family can mark the beginning of a new era of peace and progress legitimately associated with the activities of the United Nations  in the spirit reflected in the motto chosen for this anniversary: ""The United Nations for a better world"". This fortieth anniversary therefore offers us an opportunity to reflect about the role our Organization has played and the role that it can and indeed must play in keeping with its assigned mission.The United Nations has  with the passing years  asserted itself and continues to assert itself as the special forum where peoples of all nationalities  all races  diverse creeds and different ideologies have fortunately become accustomed to examining together problems of concern to the international community  with a view to exchanging ideas and achieving complementarity within the framework of a cons tractive dialog.When  at the end of the Second World War  it was decided to establish the United Nations  it was ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"". In this context  peace has constantly been in the forefront of our Organization's discussions; indeed  peace is the ultimate objective of the United Nations and it should be guaranteed by respect for its fundamental principles.Even if the specter of war has not been banished once and for all from our aims  the international community is fully aware of the generally positive nature of the efforts made by the United Nations to avoid the conflict situations and tensions which since 1945 have marked world history from turning into a new world conflagration. But the international community is also aware of the need to step up its efforts. At the same time  our Organization has actively striven to deepen and broaden the dimensions of peace by closely associating this concept with the second purpose embodied in the Charter  that is  the promotion of international co-operation - a co-operation conceived in such a way as to allow Member States mutually to enrich one another by drawing on their resources as well as on their respective experience gained in this long-term undertaking which is social and economic development.Thus in a number of various fields  the United Nations has dedicated itself to fostering co-operation inspired by the unswerving determination to establish and practice solidarity and complementarity  notably through its specialized agencies.On the eve of the International Year of Peace  whose theme will be taken up in the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization  the Republic of Rwanda once again declares itself to be a party to the efforts aimed at enabling the international community to meet victoriously the double challenge of creating a climate of peace and concord throughout the world and promoting effective complementarity among the peoples in championing development.These are the reflections the Republic of Rwanda wishes to share with its partners in the United Nations family  without seeking thus to take complete stock of the results achieved by our Organization. These are reflections in the form of a tribute in which we express our satisfaction at the universality of our Organization. These matters will be further elaborated upon by the delegation of Rwanda in the debates of ti.is session which are designed to take stock of the situation and to deal with the major problems of current concern to the international community  the settlement of which is part of the noble and lofty mission of our Organization.The Republic of Rwanda is participating in these debates with the legitimate pride of being associated with the undertaking launched 40 years ago by 51 countries - whose number has now reached 159 equal partners  thanks mainly to the process of decolonization J.n which the United Nations has played a decisive role.In this regard  it is a particularly happy coincidence that this fortieth anniversary should be celebrated at the same time as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  a resolution which assumed tangible form in the vast movement in which most of the African States gained independence  making it possible for the African peoples to be present and make their feelings known in the international arena as a vibrant reality. This element roust be singled out as being particularly significant and decisive as we take stock of what our Organization has accomplished in its first four decades and as we seek to refine and perfect its work in eliminating the last few bastions of colonialism. That is worth stressing as we pay tribute to the United Nations  thanks to which the peoples of the third world  refusing to resign themselves and taking a realistic view  are participating actively in international life and world politics.What would be the impact of ceremonies marking the fortieth anniversary of our Organization if they were accompanied by complete satisfaction as to the achievement of objectives inherent in its mission and ultimate purpose? We must recognize that we are celebrating this anniversary against a background in which realism demands that we recall - without yielding to despair or to excessive optimism - the concerns that must be addressed with regard to the challenges remaining to be overcome in the political arena  without failing to recognize also the barriers to international peace and security  and in the social and economic area  given the wide range of difficulties confronted notably by the third-world countries as they seek to promote their development.While recalling these difficulties which define the dimensions of the tragedy many countries are enduring  particularly in Africa  I wish to renew to friendly countries and also all international bodies that have supported the people of Rwanda in their development efforts. Our most sincere gratitude-for their contribution  which we fully appreciate and which we are striving to utilize as judiciously and rationally as possible.Notwithstanding the emergence of certain precarious and uncertain signs of recovery in certain industrialized countries  the world economic crisis continues. It exacerbates the imbalance characterizing international economic and financial relations. It hampers the progress of the third-world countries in promoting their development. In this regard  allow me to cite the example of Africa. In that continent the deterioration of economic conditions at the present time is such that a large number of African countries find themselves confronted with particularly painful problems  with a food crisis that is compounded by an economic and financial crisis of grave proportions.In Africa  where most of the countries classified by the United Nations as least developed are to be found  food problems occurring at the same time as eco-climatic upheavals have aggravated a situation which was already precarious and critical  a situation inherent in an asphyxiating international economic crisis in which all the third-world countries in varying degrees suffer  while the least developed countries find themselves confronted with even more acute adverse repercussions. This crisis  which is also affecting the industrialized and developed countries  has brought about a dangerous recession  provoked a particularly drastic decline in development throughout the third world  precipitated a worsening of internal and external indebtedness and brought about a reduction in levels of co-operation.Faced with this crisis  it is tine  in order to open new horizons to the countries being overwhelmed by the crisis and to fill them with the strength to survive and regain their momentum towards development  to create and promote a realistic and evolutionary concept of international co-operation  to confront  in a perspective of effective solidarity and complementarity  taking into account the interests and needs of all parties  the challenge of development and to enable the United Nations to meet and to continue to meet in this context the challenges imposed upon it by history.To meet these challenges  the international community must spare no effort to bring more equity and balance to the present international economic order  marred as it is by inequality and structural imbalances. It must avert the tragedies inherent in the poverty that remains the main problem as we near the end of the century  while demonstrating the energy and determination required by the need to check conflicts and tensions between peoples and States.In order to succeed in building a world in which there is real solidarity at the level of the international community  our Organization must show imagination and persistence in contributing actively to the radical transformation of present relationships that are contrary to the objectives of solidarity and complementarity to which the States represented in this Assembly have subscribed by accepting the United Nations Charter.Openness and concern for other peoples and nations  as in keeping with the spirit of the Charter  our common reference  should make it possible for that part of the world which lags behind to emerge from destitution and reach in its turn a level of prosperity.In this connection  the path has been indicated by the calls increasingly heard from all sides for the establishment of a new international economic order based on solidarity  in order to create a more just and humane world.It is in this spirit that the peoples of the third world are rebelling against the machinery that allows the rich to become richer at the expense of the poor  who are becoming poorer still.The growth of the economy of the industrialized countries is dependent on the survival and development of their third-world partners. It is an illusion to dream of well-being for the peoples of the developed countries alone  and acknowledgment of this fact is tantamount to an appeal to all peoples to show consistent solidarity in promoting their respective interests.This acknowledgment requires that the international community take specific measures to enable third world countries to master their development problems on the basis of present realities and within the perspective of the mastery of developments to come. In this spirit  it is particularly necessary to address the problem of co-operation in new and resolutely innovative terms with a view to reinforcing the impact of development assistance in the framework of a concept that takes into account the contingencies of the moment as well as the need constantly to guarantee the best possible results in the promotion of social and economic progress.It is necessary to ensure relations of co-operation designed to enable each partner to benefit  in the conviction that the development to which all peoples aspire will always depend on their efforts to work together in the preparation of a better future  resolving the problems inherent in the present situation  militating in favor of a genuine North-South dialog and dedicating themselves to giving practical effect to the policy of co-operation which our Organization is striving to make effective  in particular through the development programs of its specialized agencies.The Rwandese Republic is convinced of the need  within the framework of action and initiatives aimed at fostering the establishment of a more just and balanced new international economic order  to promote and further strengthen horizontal co-operation among third-world countries. This conviction is expressed in the efforts undertaken by the Government of Rwanda in the context of the objectives set by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) concerning the social and economic integration that will enable Africa to achieve collective self-sufficiency based on effective complementarity and active solidarity.These objectives were solemnly reaffirmed at the 21st Conference of Heads of State or Government of OAU member countries in the hope that the international community would mobilize actively  in particular under the leadership of the United Nations system  to give Africa all possible support in carrying out its priority program designed to enable it to confront the crisis it is facing and at the same time assure itself of the conditions necessary for the growth of its economy at the level of each individual country and at the level of the continent as a whole.In this connection  Africa intends to give priority to increasing its agricultural production so as to guarantee self-sufficiency in food  while devoting the necessary efforts to the promotion of other sectors  such as those of transport and communications  industry  trade and finance  which are also of basic importance in the development of its economy  which has been hard hit by the world recession  which has exacerbated the harmful effects of the natural disasters with which many African countries have been faced.The Rwandese Republic shares with its African partners the hope of meeting the double challenge of survival and development within the framework of the strategy of integration advocated by the Organization of African Unity.Success in giving practical expression to that strategy will hinge on the efforts that the African countries devote to its effective implementation at the national  sub-regional and regional levels  and on the support they count on receiving within the framework both of their bilateral and multilateral co-operation with the industrialized countries and of horizontal co-operation among the countries of the third world.Even if the recovery registered in certain industrialized countries spreads  as we hope it will  to all the countries in that group and becomes stabilized  the chances and prospects of seeing this trend affect the countries of the third world in a lasting way are relatively slight in the short run.This situation can be attributed essentially to the imbalances that characterize international economic relations at the levels of production  investment and trade  imbalances that persist  at the expense of the poor countries with limited resources.Among these countries  those which like Rwanda appear in the category of least developed deserve special attention and even more active support  to enable them to reduce the constraints and overcome their special development problems. The international community has recognized the need to make special efforts to help those countries  and this is the aim of the Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s adopted by the United Nations Conference held in Paris in September 1981.The Rwandese Republic has great hopes of the implementation of this program which is part of the promotion of relations directed to the consolidation of the progress of all peoples along the path of development.As well as the social and economic challenges to which X have referred  the international community finds itself faced at the same time with political crises and tensions that lead to a climate of insecurity in the world. The Government of Rwanda remains concerned over these crises and tens ions which are generally the result of conflicts of interest or actions aimed at blocking the legitimate and natural aspirations of oppressed peoples  who are determined  at all costs  to affirm and promote their most elementary and fundamental rights  in particular their right to freedom and independence.We are compelled to recognize today that little has happened to change the causes of the concern voiced on this subject at the last session of this Assembly. In taking up yet again these problems in various parts of the globe where misfortune appears to have chosen to establish itself  I should like on behalf of the Government of Rwanda to emphasize that the fate of the peoples thus stricken cannot be ignored by those countries which profess their full support for the ideals which our Organization has been striving to promote for the last 40 years  in accordance with the aims embodied in its Charter.As we commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and peoples  the situation prevailing in southern Africa reduces the scope and depth of our rejoicing and tarnishes the luster of this anniversary.Since the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 435 (1978)  each year the international community has hoped to celebrate the liberation of Namibia and to welcome that country as a fully fledged member of this Organization  but each passing year has forced us to suffer the bitterest of disappointments. In fact  each passing year the racist minority regime ensconced in Pretoria has grown more obdurate and increases its challenges to Africa and to the whole international community.In this regard  we have witnessed delaying tactics directed to dealing with the Namibian question outside the appropriate framework established by the United Nations in 1978.The Security Council itself has had to deal with the arrogance of this impenitent regime  which is promoting and implementing outworn precepts based on a racism as obsolete as it is odious  not hesitating to move from threats to deeds  as it has done in establishing the so-called ""provisional"" government at Windhoek  in defiance of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 (1978).The international community must ensure that the ""provisional"" does not continue to take the place of what should  in accordance with the pertinent resolutions and decisions adopted  in particular  by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  be the normal and definitive situation in Namibia  where the people have been waiting and struggling for so many years to see their aspirations to self-determination and independence realized.Make no mistake  the establishment of a puppet government in Namibia constitutes a new challenge to  a new violation of  the settlement plan laid down by the United Nations to lead that country to independence.How much longer will the international community remain content to express its indignation at the challenges being flung down so arrogantly and cynically by the white minority in power in Pretoria whose racist practices and rules  enshrined as the official doctrine  are an insult to the conscience of mankind?In South Africa  systematic repression is gaining in scope. It is accompanied by administrative devices and constitutional manipulations designed to deceive international public opinion by persuading it that the cosmetic reforms within a system based on the concept of apartheid  a system which both by its nature and its aims remains intrinsically incapable of genuine reform.To carry out their iniquitous and perfidious designs to perpetuate the domination of a racist minority seeking to impose its law and to substitute the right of force for the force of the law both in Namibia and in South Africa itself  the South African leaders are increasing their resort to threats  intimidation and aggression against the front-line States. No State in southern Africa is safe from their piratical expeditions: Angola  Botswana and Mozambique in particular are constantly subjected to the most brutal expressions of South Africa's contempt for the principles that govern international relations.In the circumstances  can there be any grounds for believing in the peaceful intentions of the Government of Pretoria  or for gambling on the prospect that it will mend its ways in terms of either the principles or the carrying out of its policy  while its aim remains to impose its will by force in order to establish its hegemony over peoples weakened or brought to their knees? What reaction should there be to the challenges which the Pretoria regime obdurately continues to fling down before the international community?Within the country  the resistance to oppression and repression is gaining ground and is acquiring the means of achieving the legitimate aspirations of the majority  under the aegis of genuine liberation movements recognized internationally. The racist minority in power will not succeed either in breaking their resolve or reducing the scope of the struggle undertaken to wipe out the odious system of apartheid.Outside South Africa  the international community must mobilize even more actively to impose upon this loathsome and impenitent regime concerted coercive measures to bring it back to reason and to set it on the right path  the path marked out by the principles and precepts dictated by the international morality which this regime so obstinately refuses to accept.In order to attain the goals it has set itself with a view to eliminating the last bastion of colonialism in southern Africa  and to promote the advent of a democratic regime that would respect the legitimate rights and aspirations of the majority in South Africa  the international community must bring relentless pressure to bear on the regime established in Pretoria.Moreover  it must give further tangible expression to its duty effectively to support  on all levels  the liberation movements fighting against that regime as well as supporting the front-line States which are the direct target of the policy of destabilization and aggression pursued by Pretoria.In the face of the obduracy and arrogance of the minority racist South African regime  which flouts the orthodox principles of morality and international ethics  the Republic of Rwanda optimistically dreams of the day when  in consonance with the inexorable forward march of history  Namibia will indeed be independent and South Africa will be reconciled with the international community  having renounced its shameless and anachronistic apartheid policy so as to ensure the emergence of a society that will reflect the principles of democracy.I should like to dedicate this dream  a dream which corresponds to the hopes of all peoples represented in this Assembly  to our Organization on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary. Our hopes rest on the firm conviction that the time has come for the South African leadership to renounce their outmoded principles that are the basis of their ideology  which is digging a deep chasm between them and other peoples. In that context  the international community will not be deceived by the mere appearance of reform; it will continue to demand the total eradication of the odious system of apartheid and will support and endorse the struggle of the freedom-fighters who are directly challenging a regime whose policy and practices have triggered the deepest revulsion.Only the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations will enable the Namibian people  under the banner of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  to realize its profound and legitimate aspirations for peace  freedom and Again in Africa  another people  the Sahraoui people  likewise aspires to peace and intends to achieve its right to self-determination  a universal right which is rooted by international ethics and morality.The Republic of Rwanda believes that -an equitable settlement of the question of Western Sahara can be brought about only by a dialog entered into with sincerity and with the political willingness scrupulously to respect the right of self-determination. It is in that spirit that the two parties to the conflict should  as the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations have invited them to do  commit themselves without further delay to direct negotiations aimed at the holding of a referendum which would enable the Sahraoui people to decide freely on their future.Last year from this same rostrum  in deploring the burdens weighing heavily on fostering of a climate of security in Africa  I pointed out that the continent in no sense had a monopoly on situations of tension and conflict. Thus  in the Middle East  the martyrdom of the Palestinian people has been going on for over 30 years and  as in the case of South Africa  the State of Israel has hurled one challenge after another  flouting the principles duly established by international law by pursuing an unacceptable and arrogant policy with regard to the Palestinian people and to neighboring countries which are confronted by its threats and acts of aggression against their territorial integrity.In this context  we should indeed recall the situation obtaining in Lebanon  stressing that  in solidarity with the people of Lebanon  the Republic of Rwanda supports efforts aimed at ensuring the internal security of that country  with respect for its territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence.At the same time  the Republic of Rwanda remains convinced that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East question requires first the recognition of and respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  to be freely exercised under the aegis of its genuine and legitimate representatives as gathered within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as well as by the unconditional withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied by force by Israel since 1967. The quest for such a settlement must also be guided by justice and must take into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people based on international legality.Concerned by the fate of the Palestinian people and by the persistent instability in Lebanon  the Republic of Rwanda also feels concern over the continuation of the war between Iraq and Iran  a war which is taking on ever more alarming dimensions. The Government of Rwanda is encouraging initiatives and efforts of mediation aimed at putting an end to that fratricidal conflict.In Asia  the objective of promoting peace and security has been seriously compromised by the persistence of a climate of crisis and tension in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. In this connection  the Republic of Rwanda reaffirms its adherence to the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and associates itself with the relevant decisions taken by our Organization  inspired by the need scrupulously to respect that principle.It is that same principle as well as that calling for the peaceful settlement of disputes which should remain our watchword in the face of situations of tension and conflict found in other parts of the world  particularly in the third world  so that the international community can ensure the peace and security which are the only guarantors for success in efforts undertaken to promote the prosperity of peoples in understanding and concord.In the same spirit  referring to the fundamental principles of the Charter of our Organization  the Republic of Rwanda deeply appreciates and supports efforts aimed at promoting the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic in the hope that those efforts will make it possible to give tangible expression to the legitimate  lasting and strongly felt aspirations of the German people to regain its unity. Those efforts mark a major contribution towards the promotion of detente  on which the creation of a climate of peace and security throughout the international community continues largely to depend.Our Organization recognizes that divided nations are entitled to seek ways and means to restore their unity through dialog and free from outside interference or pressure. It is from this standpoint that Rwanda also supports specific initiatives and action aimed at ensuring the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.The United Nations was created for the fundamental purpose of ensuring the consolidation of peace and security ii.v the world  social and economic development and the promotion of human rights. Viewed thus  disarmament is part and parcel of the concerns felt by the international community.In this connection  and in the opinion of the Rwandese Republic  disarmament is intrinsically linked with the promotion of development  and also with the need to adopt effective and tangible measures within the framework of a constructive dialog  so as to obviate any risks stemming from ""oneupmanship"" in the arms race and from the resistance of tension throughout the world. It is of the opinion that these measures must be part and parcel of a strategy aimed at releasing the resources that so many countries  deprived of their rightful heritage  need to resolve their distressing and acute socio-economic development problems.In a day and age when scientific and technological achievements have made possible feats bordering on the miraculous  and when nothing any longer seems to be Utopian or impossible for human creative genius  how can we endure any further the intolerable incongruity between the agonizing tragedy of the peoples of the third world - and particularly those of Africa  ravaged by famine and poverty  asphyxiated by the burden of their external debt  crushed by their encumbered heritage and plunged into total uncertainty about their future and  indeed  their very survival - and the scandal of enormous human  scientific  material and financial resources being drained away to produce increasingly sophisticated weaponry in a rivalry which is liable to lead humanity to its own destruction?On the eve of the International Year of Peace  and inasmuch as peace cannot be conceived of or become a reality without justice - which presupposes the equitable sharing of the resources of all humanity - the gift that the United Nations most richly deserves on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary is for the international community- to become more aware of the intrinsic linkage between disarmament and development  between the demands of security and the aspirations of peoples for well-being and prosperity.Having emphasized the concern that the Rwandese Republic shares with all other countries devoted to peace  freedom  equality and justice concern which is inherent in the economic crisis which is compounded by a wide variety of political tensions - I should like to echo the eminent speakers who have preceded me on this podium  and in my turn  and on behalf of the delegation of Rwanda  address our most heartfelt and sincere congratulations to Ambassador de Pinies of Spain personally  as well as to all the officers with whom he was elected to guide the work of this current session of the General Assembly  which is being held in a specific context involving the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization.At the same time  I should like to pay tribute to Ambassador Paul Lusaka  who presided with much verve over the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  and that of the Preparatory Committee for this anniversary  thus reflecting great credit on Africa in general and on his own country  Zambia  in particular.The Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his part  deserves the warmest congratulations  which I address to him today on behalf of the Government of Rwanda  and I would once again express to him our great appreciation of the dynamism and competence with which he promotes the objectives of our Organization and strives to ensure that it not only remains but develops even further as the special setting in which are expressed the noble aspirations and fundamental values of peoples  and that a salutary convergence of their interests and a perfect symbiosis of their behavior and policies  inherent in the complementarity of their interests  take tangible shape.In this spirit  the Rwandese Republic hopes that the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will indeed offer us an opportunity to take stock quite objectively of what has been achieved over the past four decades  so as to provide an accurate picture of what we can all do to bring our undertaking to a successful conclusion and to attain more fully our common objectives  guided by the determination to hold high the standard of the ideal that inspired the authors of the Charter signed in 1945 at San Francisco.In this spirit  this fortieth anniversary oust  for each Member State  be the occasion for reaffirming its commitment to the promotion of this ideal  so that the international community can take steps to safeguard its future  by ensuring a real and lasting peace and by enabling the countries of the third world to escape the cycle of underdevelopment and to benefit from an effective reduction of the tensions of which they only too often constitute the stakes.Thus  in addition to declarations of principle aimed at taking note of this community of interests among all peoples and proclaiming the need for a new impetus to promote the policy of detente  concord and co-operation  we must ensure that this anniversary becomes a decisive stage in the strengthening of the role of our Organization in the face of the challenges the international community must take up in order to influence the course of events in such a way as to avoid the reefs on which it could founder were it to abandon the collective determination to translate into reality the objectives laid down in the San Francisco Charter.The people of Rwanda  firmly convinced that on this subject its determination and faith are the same as that of the peoples with whom it shares the aspirations expressed in 1945  solemnly reaffirms its commitments under the Charter  whose principles offer the best guidance for mankind as it seeks peace  security and prosperity.May the United Nations endure in its respect for its fundamental principles  and may it attain its noble  indeed  sublime objectives."
"107",6041,"SAU",40,1985,"On behalf of His Majesty King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia  I have pleasure in beginning my statement before the Assembly by congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The confidence shown in you by the Assembly in electing you to that high office is a tribute to your personal qualities and a recognition of the important role played by your friendly country  Spain  in strengthening the bonds of international understanding and laying the foundations of co-operation amongst nations.I take this opportunity to convey my greetings to the President of the General Assembly at its previous session and to praise his wisdom and good administration.It also gives me pleasure to express appreciation of the unceasing efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to enhance the opportunities for peace and reduce the sources of tension that prevail in various parts of the world.We meet today on an important occasion as our Organization celebrates its fortieth anniversary and this provides a good opportunity to evaluate the role and achievements of the Organization. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proud of the fact that it was one of the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter and its faith in the importance of this Organization and the objectives it strives to achieve has never been shaken since that time. But that is not the only reason for our interest in this occasion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which adheres to the religion of Islam  plays a significant international role because it follows a foreign policy which conforms with the basic principles on which this Organization is based and the noble objectives laid down in the United Nations Charter  those being in accordance with Islamic law  in matters pertaining to the conduct of inter-State relations. The eternal message of Islam unites and does not divide  establishes justice and does not inflict injustice  equalizes and does not discriminate. It calls for work and co-operation among believers in God everywhere to spread these sublime principles and to bring about security and prosperity for mankind as a whole.Based on these considerations  we confirm our serious dedication to working to increase support for the United Nations and its specialized agencies  because we believe that the Organization provides a viable framework for co-operation between countries and peoples  an important forum for dialog and understanding and effective means of settling disputes and defusing crises. We deplore all the trends that hamper its activities and strongly condemn States that continuously violate its resolutions and disregard what this Organization represents in terms of the collective will of the world community.The world in which we live is overburdened with conflicts  restlessness and trouble. There are complex political problems awaiting solution and acute economic crises threatening security and stability. It is not at all fair to place the burden of responsibility for all this on the shoulders of this Organization alone. Inasmuch as a social community is affected by the behavior and conduct of its members  the success or failure of this international Organization is tied to the stance of its Member States and the degree of their commitment to implement its resolutions  their belief in its purposes and principles and their determination to fulfill their obligations.In this context  special responsibilities are borne by the great Powers. The fact that they are great Powers has enabled them to acquire an abundant measure of power and influence. It is the duty of those States to find common ground for fair and just international co-operation and to safeguard the interests of small States and-respect their independence. We call upon the great Powers  and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  to live up to the serious responsibilities that they bear.He wish to express from this rostrum our satisfaction with the stand taken by the United States in supporting the people of Afghanistan and their right to self-determination. We also express satisfaction with the stand taken by the Soviet Union in supporting the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination. However  the Soviet Union's support for the Arab cause and Arab rights in Palestine does not give it the right to a free hand in Afghanistan or justify its military occupation of that country and its depriving the Afghan people of their independence and dignity. Similarly  the opposition of the United States of America to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and its call for recognition of the right to self-determination of the Afghan people does not justify its unlimited and unconditional support for Israel and its lack of support for the right of the Palestinian people freely to determine their own destiny and to establish their own state on their own land. The United States should support right  justice and international legitimacy.While the main objective of the United Nations and the principle on which the philosophy of the Charter was established are those of international security and stability  the fact is that since 1947 Israel has been working actively to undermine that objective and principle in the Middle East  where peace has not prevailed and security has not taken root.Not long ago we witnessed the criminal Israeli act of aggression against Iraq. Now Israel's aggressive nature.has been even more clearly demonstrated by a similar criminal act against the sister country of Tunisia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns that aggression  declares its unwavering support for Tunisia and calls upon all peace-loving countries and this Organization and all its organs to impose deterrent sanctions against Israel.This call is addressed in particular to the States members of the Security Council. We ask them to shoulder their responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security and to put an end to aggression.Israel was created in the Middle Bast by an act of aggression against Palestine and the Palestinian people. His late Majesty King Abdul-Aziz  in a message to this Assembly that was transmitted at the time by His late Majesty King Faisal Bin Abdul-Aziz  made the following appeal from this rostrum to the representatives of the States gathered together on 26 November 1947  three days before the adoption of the partition resolution:""In your hands lies the responsibility for achieving peace and security in the Middle East  and in your hands lies also the capacity to fuel conflict and bloodshed"".This message  with all its elements of perception and responsibility  is the basis for the conduct of the policy of His Majesty King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz and his Government - a course in favor of the rights of the Palestinian people that has never changed. Until the aspirations of that people are realized  His Majesty Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz will continue to call for justice and fairness and to work towards achieving them  since  in the view of His Majesty  the problem of the Palestinian people constitutes one of the problems that is most dangerous for international peace and security.It is truly regrettable that the United Nations did not heed the warnings of His Majesty King Abdul-Aziz  for its attempts during the 38 years of search for a just solution to the Palestinian problem have had no results. This Organization has adopted dozens of resolutions dealing with flagrant Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people. Some of those resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council and by the General Assembly since 11 December 1948  when the resolution was adopted calling for the return of the displaced people of Palestine to their homeland  if they wished to return  or for compensation for those who did not wish to return. That resolution was followed by dozens adopted by this Organization on this matter; indeed  there are so many of them that it is unnecessary to cite them.But  so long as the resolutions do not provide for penalties  Israel will continue to ignore them and even to declare its determination to challenge them. Israel has been encouraged in its excesses and in its disregard for United Nations resolutions by the failure of the Security Council  owing to the exercise of the veto  to adopt any resolution to deter Israel. Thus  any resolution condemning Israeli practices that is adopted by the General Assembly will find no positive response from or be heeded by Israel  which was brought into existence by this Organization. Indeed  Israel has even started attacking the United Nations itself and accusing it of bias.The credibility of this Organization is likely to be shaken if it continues to confine itself to adopting resolutions and recommendations. The United Nations has done enough urging and condemning; yet a comprehensive and just settlement of this problem has not been achieved. We should therefore ask ourselves what choice is left to the United Nations except to move this consensus ahead from the level of condemnation to the level of concrete action to attain that settlement. This Organization has no choice but to regain its credibility and to affirm that credibility by giving a serious character to its resolutions  for they cannot be serious if they are not implemented.The problems that our region is facing and the complications that appear on the ground there are in fact  and in the final analysis  only repercussions of the Zionist aggression against Palestine  and the actual result of the accumulation of developments in the Palestine problem. The wars and political and military conflicts through which the area has been living for the past 33 years are but one effect of the failure to solve the basic problem  and are a result of Israeli aggression in the area. The perpetuation of Israeli occupation of Arab territories is living proof of its designs for expansion  its flagrant defiance of United Nations resolutions and its constant disregard for world public opinion and every law and convention.The painful circumstances and sad situations that Lebanon is suffering today are in reality but one of the serious complications of this problem.From all that  it is clear and obvious that the establishment of peace in the Middle East requires the solution of the main problem  which is the problem of Palestine  by the recognition of the inalienable and legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination on its territory and in its homeland. This requires the pursuit of firm and resolute steps in order to avoid the complications created by reluctance and hesitation  which hinder the efforts being exerted to achieve peace.Israel's defiance and its continued attempts to hinder peace efforts in order to gain time to achieve its objectives and designs cannot but provide the opportunity for increased disturbances and cannot but lead to complications that will increase the difficulties of solving the problem  as well as multiply the factors leading to inflammation of and explosions in the area.Thus  we call upon the big Powers  to which the Zionist entity owes the means of its existence and its continued viability  to refrain from giving the economic  political and military assistance enabling Israel to continue its aggressive policy in the Middle East  and to play a role that is in conformity with the principles of right and justice and the right of peoples to self-determination. Otherwise  they will lose their credibility and their effectiveness in influencing events in the Middle East. I need not reiterate the obvious fact that no solution will succeed if it does not include the principal and genuine party to the conflict.On that basis  proposing any means or taking any step to solve the problem of Palestine requires that the Palestine Liberation Organization - the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people - should be one of the parties in the discussion and one of the participants in the dialog. If peace is to be permanent  it must emanate from the area of the conflict and must be based on a justice through which the legitimate owners will recover their rights.The Arab States have shouldered their historic responsibilities and have contributed everything within their capabilities for the purpose of establishing peace and stability in the region; they have defined their understanding of the peace process in the Fez resolutions  which reflect the Arab consensus on peace based on justice and international legitimacy and which conform to the international will represented by United Nations resolutions. But peace  according to the creed of our people  does not mean surrender and acceptance of the status quo  for we are a people that seeks justice and upholds rights  while rejecting oppression and refusing submission.There is no alternative to Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  because occupation is against all international laws and the principles and purposes of the United Nations as well as against peace and security in the area and in the world at large. It is called for as a primary step on the path to solving the basic problem  to the solution of which peace in the area is tied. The overall perspective  - which is the necessary approach - requires a clear insight into the problem and into the elements of a solution.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  together with the great majority of the world community  demands withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and considers Al-Quds-Al-Sharif foremost among those territories.It is regrettable that the use of force has regained a position of prominence in modern international relations.What is taking place in Afghanistan is a serious indication of what would happen in the world  and the third world in particular  should this trend continue without a firm stand being taken by the world community.Otherwise  who will defend the peoples of the third world against direct occupation like that experienced by the sister State of Afghanistan? The Soviet presence in Afghanistan has entered its sixth year  and the Afghan mujahideen continue to wage a valiant war  defending their religion  their country and their rights. The Organization of the Islamic Conference has made intensive efforts to help eliminate the oppression and occupation to which the people of Afghanistan have been subjected  so that the wishes of that people may be met and its rights of freedom and independence realized. The United Nations too has made worthy efforts to find a solution to this problem.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  while it supports all these efforts  would like to draw attention to the fact that any efforts exerted in this context should take into consideration the rights and demands of the Afghan mujahideen. Just as it salutes the mujahideen  Saudi Arabia fully supports the demands of the Afghan people for the withdrawal of foreign troops from their land and for the establishment of a government of their choice that will maintain their neutrality and preserve their religion.The war between Iraq and Iran  which we are following with deep concern and sorrow  has added a new dimension to the tense situation in the Middle East region  quite apart from the bloodshed  destruction and ruin it has brought about in two brotherly nations which are bound to each other  and to us  by the closest of links and the strongest of ties. The Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Co-operation Council of the Arab Gulf States  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and this international Organization have called for and worked towards an end to this bloody tragedy. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported and participated in all these efforts. If any positive stand has been taken so far  it is  fortunately  that manifested by what Iraq has shown of a total readiness to forget the past and solve its problems with Iran by peaceful means.It is high time that Iran responded to Iraq's positive stand by taking a similar position. It is high time that the fighters on both sides laid down their weapons  stopped the bloodshed and turned to reason and wisdom rather than war and destruction  and directed all their efforts to construction rather than destruction  progress rather than regression  and building rather than demolition.Among the positive achievements of which we are proud in the context of political development in our area is the establishment of the Co-operation Council of Arab Gulf States. This is a model of what regional co-operation should be  and a pillar for strengthening the League of Arab States. Moreover  the Co-operation Council conforms with the principles of the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement and is a positive factor for stability in the region.The policies and conditions imposed by South Africa in Namibia and in South Africa itself are yet another example of the use of force  terror and discrimination to subjugate peoples and to overcome their will. Recent events in South Africa draw attention to the gravity of what is taking place there. The situation will become increasingly explosive as long as the racist regime continues its violence through its system of discrimination and apartheid  a system which is doomed to inevitable failure.In this context  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its total support for the people of Namibia in its struggle for self-determination and independence and its support for all steps taken by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity aimed at putting an end to racist practices and foreign occupation.Experience in the United Nations over the past 40 years has proven the need to reform the world economic order and the importance of urgently implementing the decisions taken at the sixth and seventh second special sessions of the General Assembly  devoted respectively to the new international economic order and to international economic co-operation for development. It has also demonstrated the viability of starting a new round of comprehensive global economic negotiations aimed at achieving that goal. That experience has shown too the futility of excessive claims and extreme positions and the necessity of reaching a reasonable compromise between wide-ranging aspirations and limited possibilities.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has endeavored to make a positive contribution to the work of this organization and has always called for co-operation and the avoidance of confrontation in international economic relations. It has attempted through its contacts with the industrialized countries to enhance interest in the problems of development and developing countries while at the same time urging developing countries to articulate their demands in a spirit of realism and rationality. From this rostrum I wish to call upon the international community to address the issue of international economic co-operation and the establishment of an international economic order in a spirit of positivism and realism  respecting the legitimate interests of all Member States and giving the development dimension its due place in international economic relations  while not infringing upon the authority of the international specialized agencies which  while they have been unable to meet the full aspirations of the international community  have proved beyond any doubt their ability and effectiveness  within the limited means permitted by their resources and mandates  in addressing the difficulties faced by that community.The economic situation in a great number of developing countries  especially on the African continent  is a very serious situation that urgently requires commensurate concern on our part. The suffering and pain of the African peoples has reached dimensions of which mankind should be ashamed. I am sure that  God willing  our Organization will not disappoint the hopes of those peoples and will seek >o address the situation in Africa with the extreme concern and urgency it demands.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recognizes the seriousness of the economic conditions in Africa and  within the framework of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  has for some time been taking the initiative to assist the African countries which have been suffering from drought. We have contributed $100 million to the program approved by that organization  part of which sum was earmarked for immediate emergency assistance and the larger part of which will be allocated to well drilling and water supply projects.Recently the Kingdom increased its contribution to this program by an additional sum of $30 million. It has also responded to the call of the world Bank and has supported the Bank's special program to assist African countries suffering from drought with a contribution of $100 million from the Saudi Development Fund. At the same time  it recognizes the importance of continued public participation in alleviating the pain of the African people suffering from drought and has formed popular committees in various parts of the Kingdom to collect contributions in cash and in kind for the benefit of the drought victims.The African summit conference has considered the serious economic conditions prevailing on the African continent  and has adopted resolutions and recommendations which are being presented to the General Assembly at its present session. I should like to express the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the efforts of the African leaders and for their desire to see their resolutions and recommendations considered with seriousness  care and concern in keeping with the magnitude of the problems from which Africa is suffering. I should like also to note the responsibility that falls on the shoulders of the United Nations in mobilizing international efforts in this respect.The concern of the world community for the problems of the African continent reflects and urgent duty which should be accorded the attention it deserves  but at the same time this should not divert attention from the suffering of a great number of the other least developed countries or from their need for increased assistance in their economic and social development efforts. I wish to declare from this rostrum our continued support for the programs of the United Nations that are concerned with the least developed of the developing countries.The grave economic conditions in many parts of the world - which are characterized by widespread unemployment  a decline in world trading conditions  an increasing trend towards economic protectionism and turbulent monetary and financial conditions in many countries  which threaten the international monetary system at its very core - require stronger economic co-operation and renewed confidence in the international economic system and its institutions. I hope that this session will provide the political will and a favorable climate and conditions for the beginning of a new page in the history of our Organization and for working in unison in the service of the human objectives for which the United Nations was established. The passage of 40 years since the creation of the United Nations is an important occasion requiring us to think urgently about serious and responsible action to fulfill the commitment to the basic principles of our Organization and enhance its noble goals. It is a timely opportunity for all members of the international community to join together in building a world based on goodwill and adherence to principles and morals rather than opting for the use of force and oppression  so that the policies of conflict and war will disappear and peace will prevail thereby solving disputes amicably and conducting relations in a constructive and useful manner. This would lead to harnessing the world's human and material potential to enhance the life of man rather than its being wasted on the arms race and on instruments of death and destruction; and justice would then prevail and relations between States could be based on equality  brotherhood and co-operation. As God Almighty in the Holy Koran instructs us: ""Help ye one another In righteousness and piety  But help ye not one another In sin and rancor; Fear God; for God Is strict in punishment."""
"108",6078,"SDN",40,1985,"I am honored Sir  to extend to you our warm congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at this significant and historic session. Your election reflects the appreciation of the international community for your skilled leadership  and its esteem for your country  with which the Sudan has strong ties of friendship.I should also like to express the deep appreciation of my delegation to your predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  who brought honor to his country and to Africa as a whole through his skill in successfully conducting the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  a skill reflected in the numerous achievements of that session despite a number of difficulties and obstacles.I should also like to express our appreciation and thanks to His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his invaluable work at the head of our Organization  and for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization  which gives a sound evaluation of the achievements and duties of the Organization on its fortieth anniversary in the light of the provisions of the Charter.I should also like to extend to the Head of the Mexican delegation the sincere sympathy of the Government and people of the Sudan to the Government and people of Mexico on the recent catastrophe which devastated Mexico and claimed the lives of thousands of its people.The United Nations is currently playing host to world leaders commemorating its fortieth anniversary. We must pause on this occasion to examine the problems and challenges that face us and to evaluate the work of the Organization during the past four decades of its existence. Our belief in the mission and principles of the United Nations requires us to attach special importance to its fortieth anniversary. We believe this is a good opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of the Charter and our support for the international Organization in the fulfillment of its noble mission  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of international co-operation in all vital fields.The Assembly has naturally followed the recent political developments in my country which on 6 April last led to the victory of the popular revolution and to the elimination of an authoritarian rule which had lasted for 16 years. Through that great upheaval  our people in the Sudan affirmed its commitment to die democratic option  the safeguarding of human rights and the solution of our problems by peaceful means and through dialog. Our people also renewed their firm belief in the Charter of the United Nations and in the other regional organizations to which it belongs.Since its inception  the Transitional Government has sought to establish relations of good neighborliness with all neighboring countries  to settle disputes peacefully  to promote regional and international co-operation and to consolidate the principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  of which Sudan is one of the founding members. We initiated all this immediately upon the victory of the popular will last April  and we opened our doors to friendship with all. We have affirmed the freedom and dignity of the citizen and his right to full political participation and we have restored the freedom of the press  the independence of the judiciary  the neutrality of the civil service and the sanctity of the universities and other educational institutions.The Assembly is aware that the problems and difficult circumstances we are facing at present  especially those of the drought  starvation and influx of refugees  constitute a heavy burden which we are doing our utmost to shoulder. We have succeeded to a great extent in mobilizing the available resources to contain the catastrophe of starvation and drought which has devastated various parts of the country. We have established a Supreme Committee  under the direct supervision of the Provisional Military Council  to co-operate with the donor States and relief organizations. The assistance of friends has been combined with that of the international community to help us to overcome this devastating catastrophe which is afflicting our country. The General Assembly is perhaps familiar with the real magnitude and dimensions of the problem and of its implications  as reflected in various reports published by the United Nations and those of its agencies involved.My country looks forward to continued aid by the international community and by friendly and fraternal States  commensurate with the gravity of the starvation  especially during this phase when the processes of relief are facing great difficulties because of the rains impeding the transport of relief to the more disadvantaged areas in the west of the country  which has led to an accumulation of relief supplies at the only port in the country.While on the subject of the grave conditions prevailing in my country  I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express our deep appreciation of the prompt response and the spirit of solidarity demonstrated by the United Nations and the international community in respect of the critical economic situation in my country and elsewhere in Africa. I would like to extend grateful thanks to all those who have come to the assistance of the Sudan  and in particular I commend the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization in Africa under Mr-. Bradford Morse  Mr. Maurice Strong and Mr. Winston Bradley  the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for relief operations in the Sudan  together with their colleagues and assistants in the field  the United Nations Development Program and other specialized agencies and their representatives in the Sudan. I should also like to thank the Governments of the United States  the member countries of the European Economic Community  the Government and people of Japan  the Arab States and other fraternal and friendly States  the non-governmental organizations  voluntary organizations and associations of artists in Europe and the United States.Our experience of relief operations in Africa has proved that the United Nations is capable of carrying out its duties and commitments towards the international community  given the necessary support and confidence. The Disaster Relief Office has succeeded in acquainting the international community with the magnitude of the tragedy and the real needs and priorities of the various affected States. It has also succeeded in mobilizing international support and in co-ordinating the efforts of specialized agencies and voluntary organizations. As we celebrate this year the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  I should like to cite this experience as a living example of the effectiveness and success of the United Nations in the vital field of relief. While hoping that the Office will continue its relief efforts  we also hope that the success of this experience will be reflected in the contribution of the United Nations system to the support of the African States in moving from the relief phase to the phase of rehabilitation and development. That is the main challenge facing the African countries and the international community.The current economic crisis is still adversely affecting the developing countries  and especially those in Africa. The critical economic situation currently prevailing in Africa  with its short-term and long-term effects  constitutes one of the negative aspects of international economic relations. The United Nations Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa  adopted by the General Assembly at its last session  is a candid acknowledgment of the deterioration of that situation and a conscious awareness on the part of the international community of the need to face that crisis which  in our view  is the result of several factors  the most important being the current stagnation of the world economy and the repercussions of an unjust international economic order which has driven most developing countries into increasing indebtedness  has devastated their economy and trapped them in a vicious circle of instability. The repercussions of this situation are most dangerous for the African countries concerned. What has probably contributed to the compounding of the problems of the African States in particular are the natural disasters which have devastated those countries  and also the problem of refugees. The twenty-first summit meeting of the-Organization of African Unity  convened last July  was devoted to a discussion of economic problems. That meeting was a landmark in the African endeavor to contain these grave economic effects. One of the most important characteristics of that meeting was the acknowledgment for the first time by the African Presidents of the shortcomings of local economic policies  and their readiness to adopt corrective measures and to formulate policies in conformity with reality and with local and international conditions.They also affirmed that the primary responsibility for the development of Africa falls on the Governments and peoples of Africa. They reaffirmed the validity of the objectives of the Lagos Plan of Action: self-reliance  rehabilitation and revitalization in the food and agricultural sectors.At the Conference the Heads of Government also reviewed the problem of Africa's external indebtedness  a problem which has worsened in the past few years because of the increasing international monetary and economic crisis. That crisis has had serious repercussions on the development processes because of the increasing burden of indebtedness and the decrease in the flow of new financial resources and concessionary terms for development efforts.Although we fully respect our international commitment to repay these debts  we simply cannot  on the one hand  repay them and  on the other  continue to provide even the basic means of survival for our peoples. There must be further and intensified international efforts; all the necessary ingenuity must be brought to bear to find new methods that avoid the traditional formulas  which have provided only palliatives and not cures. The international action necessary to deal with the indebtedness problem must take into account the deteriorating situation in some countries  especially the most disadvantaged and least developed countries in Africa  which are in a deficit situation and are clearly unable to repay their debts. The debts must be rescheduled for a longer period and  in addition  the grace period must be extended and new concessionary terms must be worked out  taking into account the ability of the African countries to repay without damaging their importation possibilities.At the Addis Ababa summit conference  the African Heads of State and Government took two initiatives in connection with their examination of the problems of Africa. First  they called for the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to deal with all aspects of the economic crisis in Africa and to examine medium-term and long-term methods for solving that crisis. Secondly  they called for the convening of an international conference on Africa's external indebtedness  which has completely paralyzed the economies of Africa. We hope that during this session the General Assembly will reach agreement on the convening of a special session and on the sound preparations to be made for it. We hope also that the current session will provide a good opportunity for consultations on the proposed international conference on Africa's indebtedness.These are glorious days for southern Africa. Men? women and children are engaged in an all-out revolution in South Africa to sweep away the abominable policy of apartheid. The apartheid regime has been making cosmetic changes which in no way affect the essence of the policy of apartheid. The African States and the international community as a whole have for the past decade been drawing attention to the risks inherent in South Africa's continued policies and practices  and have been calling for the intensification of serious action to put an end to the racist regime. But the ""Atinued military and economic co-oDeration between certain States and the Pretoria regime has helped to entrench that regime and to enable it to continue its racist oppressive policies against the Black majority and its aggression against the neighboring African States.The terrorism practiced by the white minority Government will not succeed in extinguishing the heroic resistance of the courageous people of south Africa  which is engaged in an all-out revolution which will certainly result soon in victory. From this rostrum we salute the defenseless people of South Africa in their struggle and reaffirm our absolute support for that struggle  under the leadership of the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. We call for an increase in international support for the In this regard  we must note that the policy of ""constructive engagement"" with the racist minority Government has proved that it cannot effect the desired change; rather  it has contributed to increasing the intransigence and arrogance of the Pretoria Government. Furthermore  the argument that the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa will lead only to mote misery for the Black people is fallacious. Continued economic co-operation with South Africa and the continued flow of investments to South Africa lead only to hampering the increasing attempts to isolate the Pretoria regime; they provide it with the resources it needs to continue its policy of apartheid and to deprive the Black majority of its legitimate rights. Only the tightening of the stranglehold on the Pretoria regime  the isolation of that Government and the imposition of a complete boycott and further sanctions against it can lead to the termination of the abominable apartheid regime and the exercise by the Black majority of its legitimate and just Eights  as well as the establishment of a sound  democratic society based on justice and equality and guaranteeing freedom for all.We have followed with great interest the response by some Governments and parliamentary institutions  and their adoption of varying degrees of economic boycotts of the South African Government. We hope that even these limited actions will mark the beginning of a unified and intensified international effort to support the struggle the people of South Africa and that they will accelerate the desired radical change in that country.The subject of the co-operation by some countries with the racist Pretoria regime  with a view to entrenching that regime in power  leads us to denounce the intense co-operation between the racist ideology in South Africa and the Zionist ideology in Israel  especially in the cultural  economic and military fields. The culmination of that co-operation has been its extension to the nuclear field  resulting in the development of nuclear capabilities threatening the Arab and African regions and frustrating the endeavors now under way for the declaration of the two regions as nuclear-free zones. We condemn this co-operation and call for an increase in the campaigns by the international community to expose the co-operation and ensure that an end is put to it once and for us.The Pretoria Government is still defying the international community by occupying Namibia and imposing its domination on Namibia  despite the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The international community has constantly condemned the Pretoria Government for its illegal occupation of that Territory and for plundering its natural resources. We state again that the only basis for a peaceful settlement of the problem of Namibia is the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). From this rostrum we repeat Sudan's categorical rejection of the linking of Namibia's independence with other issues. We also reject the installation by the South African Government of an interim government in Namibia. We reaffirm the legal responsibility of the United Nations for the independence of that Territory and the duty of the Security Council to ensure implementation of its resolutions.We also support the struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and we urge that it be given all possible support. In this regard  we hope that Security Council resolution 569 (1985) will constitute a serious step towards the imposition of mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter.I do not think I need to stress the gravity of the situation in the Middle East and its real danger not only for security in that region but for international peace and security. The lack of a just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine  which constitutes the core of the conflict in the Middle East  has continuously aggravated the situation in that area  especially in view of Israel's persistence in its illegal occupation of Arab territories  in its confiscation of Arab lands and in depriving the Palestinian people of its legitimate and inalienable rights guaranteed by the United Nations Charter and reaffirmed in numerous resolutions of this Organization since its inception.The acts of aggression still being committed by Israel against Lebanon and its continued brutal bombardment of the Palestinian camps is positive proof of its intentions and its disregard of international public opinion  international institutions and the security of the peoples and States of the region.The Arab states  at the Fez Summit Conference and on other occasions  have affirmed their commitment to peace based on justice and right for all peoples and States in the region  thus providing a historic opportunity for the restoration of peace in one of the most important and sensitive areas of the world. But Israel has chosen to take the opposite course and to persist in its policy of aggression  disregarding all peace efforts.The international community has affirmed in various forums its conviction that a lasting  just peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through the full and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Holy Jerusalem  and the exercise by the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole  legitimate representative  of its inalienable rights  including its right to establish its independent State on its own soil  in accordance with its free will. These conditions remain a firm foundation for peace based on justice  not peace imposed by force of arms.In this context  we reaffirm the importance of convening an international conference on peace in the Middle East  as specified in the Geneva Declaration of 1983  which was endorsed by the General Assembly  if the United Nations is to carry out its duties and responsibilities and contribute to the solution of this question on the basis of justice  right and international legitimacy. We declare from this rostrum our support for all sincere  serious efforts to settle the conflict in the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties concerned  on the international and regional levels and on a footing of equality at every stage.The Government and people of Sudan have been following with great sorrow the continuing war between Iraq and Iran  which has now entered its sixth year. We feel great sadness at the continuing conflict between those two countries to which we are bound by close historical and spiritual links. Like other friendly Moslem people  we feel the bitterness of this strife  which has had devastating effects on the resources and potentials of those two neighboring countries and shaken the stability and security of the entire Gulf area. The international community has on numerous occasions stressed the need to bring about a peaceful settlement of this conflict. The Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have made efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to put an end to this bloody war in a context of respect for the basic tenets of international law  the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Sudan will continue to support these endeavors until there is a positive response to the appeals of the international community and the fighting between the two neighboring States is ended.Sudan has always believed in the peaceful settlement of disputes  through dialog and negotiations  without resort to the logic of force and aggression. Accordingly  wet have repeatedly stressed the need for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan in such manner as to preserve for the people of Afghanistan its sovereignly   self-determination and freedom  without foreign interference in its internal affairs.Similarly  we consistently assert the importance of achieving a lasting and just solution to the question of Kampuchea in accordance with international law and in the context of the Charter of the United Nations.The continued tension in South-East Asia makes it imperative for the international community to seek a comprehensive political solution that guarantees the withdrawal of all foreign forces and full respect for the independence of all States of the region  including Kampuchea. We reiterate our support for the efforts exerted by the Association of South-Hast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to achieve an acceptable  peaceful solution to this problem.We are deeply convinced that peaceful dialog is the only way to settle conflicts. This conviction makes us look continuously for a solution between the Cypriot communities through serious negotiation and constructive dialog. We welcome the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this direction. We believe that they constitute the right approach to finding a just solution to the problem that takes into account the legitimate rights of the two communities while guaranteeing the independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.We are following with interest the efforts of the Korean people to arrive at peaceful reunification through dialog  consultation and continued meetings between the representatives of organizations and institutions in the two countries.We should like to emphasize the meetings between parliamentarians and the Red Cross organizations in the two Koreas  as well as the reunions of families. We hope that these efforts will culminate in success that will enable the Korean people to make an effective contribution to the efforts of the international community towards peace and international co-operation.As far as Central America is concerned  we still hope that the peace efforts  in particular those of the Contadora Group  will be successful and that a peaceful settlement will be found that will restore stability to this important region and enable its peoples to devote their energies to achieve progress and prosperity.In the context of international peace and security  we must refer to a particularly complex and dangerous aspect  the nuclear terror  which threatens mankind with extinction through the increased rate of stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the increase in their destructive power. We hope that the fortieth anniversary of the Organization will prove a new point of departure for the negotiations on disarmament.The experience of the Second World War must never be forgotten. That war  with its social and economic destruction  proved the imperative need for international co-operation to preserve the basis of liberty and peace. But as a result of the present lack of confidence between the two super-Powers the disarmament negotiations in Geneva are stalled and this urgent question is excluded day after day from the context of the international Organization.Along with others  we stress the imperative need to control the production of conventional and nuclear weapons  quantitatively and qualitatively  to reduce military forces to the lowest possible level  to reduce military budgets and to establish a serious organic link between disarmament  and development in the interest of the developing countries.We urge implementation of the special Declaration of the 1980s as a Disarmament Decade  to be followed by the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on prohibiting nuclear tests  and by another convention prohibiting the production and use of chemical weapons. We reaffirm the need to respect nuclear-weapon-free zones.We feel that the continued building and development of military arsenals will only provide an ephemeral peace based on fear and terror. We feel that the alternative lies in rebuilding the bridges of confidence between the two super-Powers  reducing tension between them  and reactivating the disarmament negotiations in a climate of goodwill and mutual confidence in the interest of the future of mankind.We hope that the scheduled meeting between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan will create such a climate conducive to peace and pave the way towards serious and sincere co-operation among the various members of the international community in order to achieve the lofty human objectives of peace and well-being."
"109",6170,"SGP",40,1985,"Allow me to congratulate the President on his assumption of this high office. There are few men in this hall who have been associated with the United Nations as long as he has. If the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly is to provide meaningful new directions for the future  it will require vision and leadership. It could not have found a better man than him to guide it.Please allow me also to pause a moment and place on record our deep appreciation for the work done by his predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka. He brought great honor to his country and to the continent of Africa with his fine stewardship of the General Assembly through the thirty-ninth session. Not least among the achievements of the thirty-ninth session was the great outpouring of concern  both in words and deeds  for the crisis that afflicted many African nations. This was due in no small part to Ambassador Lusaka's efforts. We thank him.In recent years  the United Nations has also benefited from the wise guidance provided by the Secretary-General  His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar. In a series of remarkably candid and insightful annual reports  from 1982 to 1985  he has openly discussed and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of this Organization. Those who wish to understand where the United Nations stands today need go no further than these four annual reports to grasp the crisis and the challenges facing the United Nations today.The prestige of the united Nations is at an all-time low. The debates of the Security Council and the General AssetrJaly  which once gripped world attention  are now generally given scant consideration. The Charter states that the United Nations was created ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Yet in the last 40 years there have been about 150 armed conflicts  big and small  which have killed 16 million people  and perhaps as many as 20 million. In 1983 alone  there were 40 separate armed conflicts  major and minor  involving 75 countries  or half the membership of the United Nations. The majority of the victims of these conflicts have come from the developing countries.The United Nations has not been indifferent to these conflicts. Each year we have here taken principled stands on such key instances of foreign aggression and occupation as on the rights of the Palestinian people  and the Namibian people  and the occupation by Soviet and Vietnamese armies of Afghanistan and Cambodia. In spite of our clear statements  the conflicts persist  resulting in critics of the United Nations suggesting that this Organization may have failed.Recent developments in South Africa have given us a ray of hope. The United Nations critics claimed in the past that persistent condemnation of apartheid in this Hall would make no difference. The events of the last few weeks  where both the South African people and the international community have ferociously broken down some of the pillars of the apartheid regime  demonstrate that the persistence of this Organization can pay off.Unfortunately  in South-East Asia Viet Nam continues to denounce and reject United Nations resolutions on Cambodia  thereby undermining the credibility and legitimacy of this entire Organization. Only recently  the Non-Aligned Ministerial Meeting in Luanda reaffirmed that Movement's commitment to the decisions of the United Nations and the principles of the United Nations Charter. If  as it is often claimed by Viet Nam  Viet Nam sincerely desires to live in peace with its neighbors  it should conform to the spirit and principles of the Movement by immediately implementing the United Nations resolutions on Cambodia.I do not belong to the ranks of pessimists who claim that the days of the United Nations are numbered. I do believe  however  that the United Nations today is in some peril. There is a clear danger that this Organization may become irrelevant to issues of peace and security  the primary issues for which it was founded. To prevent that from happening  let each Member of the United Nations ask itself this question: Who gains if the United Nations fails?To use a contemporary analogy  we could liken the super-Powers to supertankers and the majority of nations of the world to little boats and some of them even to little rafts that are barely afloat.In looking at contemporary issues of war and peace  the United Nations has often fallen into the trap of looking at the world' from the perspective of the super-tanker. Several disarmament resolutions proclaim that the central issue of the day is the danger of a collision between these two super-tankers. This  in my opinion  is not so.While it is true that all of us may perish if there is a collision between these two super-tankers  such a collision is not going to occur because both of them have too much to lose from a direct collision. That is why Soviet or American soldiers have died fighting each other in the last 40 years.Each super-tanker  however  has tried to recruit small boats to ram into each other  or to churn up the waters around them in the name of revolution and liberation.Coming from a small nation like Singapore it has always been a source of amazement to us that there are so many small nations which are willing to be seduced into this task of generating turbulence. When such turbulence occurs  the super-tankers are not threatened. It is oily the other small boats that face the danger of capsizing.It is therefore a myth - perpetuated especially by one super-tanker - that revolution and turbulence are good for the third world. The small States of the third world would do well to remember that a more stable international political order would increase our chances for survival. A stable order would increase trade  investment and financial flows to the third world  enhancing our prospects for economic development.My remarks today are therefore not addressed to the super-tankers but to the over one hundred nations that are small boats and rafts. Let us pool our interests and work for a stronger  more credible and more effective United Nations because it is the only - I repeat only - international institution dedicated to such a stable international political order.In historical terms  file  Charter of the United Nations is a remarkably revolutionary document.Man's recorded history has witnessed the rise and fall of many societies and nations. The law of the jungle prevailed. Those that became mighty claimed the right to occupy neighboring territories  enslaving or massacring populations as their armies marched across different lands.In June 1945  a brave little document emerged which declared that all this had to stop. This document was the Charter of the United Nations.The critics of the United Nations who wish to see this Organization swept from the face of this earth should pause to consider the alternative. If the United Nations has not succeeded in erasing the habit of 5 000 years of recorded history  it should be remembered that the ""forty years of the United Nations existence is a mere wink in time.Going against the natural unfolding of history  the Charter of the United Nations states in Article 2 that the United Nations ""is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members"".The Charter's concepts of national sovereignty and territorial integrity means that while nations have the right to become strong and mighty if they with to do so  they have no right to expand beyond their borders. It is therefore not surprising that all the fragile new States that have emerged in the last 40 years have quickly reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations. They have done so not only because it is a noble idea but because it was the closest they could come to obtaining a guarantee for their survival.Will this revolutionary concept of equal nation States survive into the 21st century? It may. But to do so  all nation States need to invest in a strong and stable international political order. A credible  effectively functioning United Nations which strongly reinforces the principles of territorial integrity and sovereign equality  will make it easier for even the smallest States of the world to retain their independence.The small nations of this world which try to cheat on the rules of the Charter are really sowing the seeds of their own destruction.Technological advances are making the united Nations more relevant each day. The world is shrinking at a pace unprecedented in the history of man. Nations that were once separated by mountains and oceans can now look squarely into each other's eyes. Tremendous developments in telecommunications and computer technology have made this possible.In July this year  almost one and a half billion people or one quarter of this globe's population simultaneously watched a live concert held to raise aid for Africa. On this shrinking globe  where there are massive movements of peoples and goods every day  a political disturbance in Asia could lead to bombs being placed on aircraft in Canada; a new and frightening disease afflicting North America could be carried to the opposite side of the globe within twenty-four hours.We fear that the international institutions of today are unable to cope with the new networks and patterns of interdependence that are evolving each day.It is no longer accurate to say that we belong to the same planet. The old cliche that the world is a global village is more true today than ever before. Throughout history village communities have tended to be stable and enduring. People do care about their own neighbourhoods. They adopt careful and responsible positions on issues directly affecting them.In this shrinking global village it is inevitable that nations will eventually view global issues more responsibly when they see the direct implications for themselves. That day will come.We could help to expedite it by transforming this Assembly and perhaps the Security Council into a village council. This is not a frivolous or purely rhetorical suggestion.In village meetings it is sometimes useful to let off steam. The United Nations has performed this function admirably. Countless small wars have been avoided because some wise leaders have transported their anger and the anger of their populations to the hall of this General Assembly  allowing it to explode in this hall  and thus bringing a catharsis to their populations and reducing the impulse towards war. No other global institution can perform this thankless task.Too much anger and rhetoric  however  can poison the atmosphere. This too has happened in the United Nations. This institution is being overcome by the fumes of its own rhetoric. We are not the first to make this observation. In June this year  several former Presidents of the United Nations General Assembly met under the able chairmanship of Ambassador Paul Lusaka in New York to discuss the state of the United Nations. I commend their report to you.Their prescriptions were many. The United Nations Secretariat needs tight management. In the debates  consensus building should be promoted. The number and the length of United Nations resolutions should be reduced. Every effort should be made to eliminate agenda items which are no longer relevant. Meetings should start on time.If all these recommendations were adopted  the world would pay greater heed to the deliberations of this body and the important resolutions adopted each year.If we  the smaller nation Members of the United Nations  can continue to steer a wise and careful course between the two super-Powers  if we can continue to reaffirm our commitment  both in word and deed  to the United Nations Charter  and if we can gradually cleanse the deliberations of this body of empty rhetoric and posturing  then I am confident that when we reach port in the 21st century  the United Nations will continue to be relevant.Singapore  as one of the smallest member States of the United Nations  is solemnly dedicated to the task of moving the United Nations into the 21st century  and we begin by repledging our commitment  both in word and in deed  to the purposes and principles of the united Nations Charter."
"110",6203,"SLB",40,1985,"I extend to the Assembly friendly greetings and felicitations on behalf of the people and Government of Solomon Islands. I also extend to you  Sir  out warm and sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this historic session. I assure you of my delegation's full support and co-operation.To your predecessor  the representative of Zambia  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  goes our deep gratitude for his exemplary leadership of the Assembly at the last session. We are grateful to him for the hard work he has put into the preparation and organization of the commemorative session.As it will not be possible for me to attend that important commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  I wish at this stage to pay a tribute to all the former Presidents of the General Assembly and commend theirwork. Their dedication  devotion  courage and integrity  which reflect the basic human quality of humility  contributed much to the enduring spirit in which this noble body has lived and worked during the past four decades. To those distinguished men and women  the leading citizens of the world  we are very grateful.To the Secretary-General I offer my sincere congratulations on and gratitude for his unfailing pursuit of the promotion and maintenance of peace and security -the noble and worthy ideal for which the United Nations was conceived and constituted and has been nurtured in these past 40 years. Indeed  the persevering spirit in which the United Nations has been working for human betterment  in many trying times and in regions both peaceful and troubled  depends on the guiding hands and wise counseling of the Secretary-General. Thus we are deeply indebted to the Secretary-General and his predecessors.I associate Solomon Islands with those delegations that have expressed heartfelt sympathy to the people and Government of Mexico over the tragic event that occurred in their good country last month. We were deeply saddened to hear of the loss of so many lives and the extensive damage and widespread suffering there. Therefore I humbly offer our prayers and support to our brothers and sisters in Mexico.Our world today is vastly different from what it was 40 years ago when theUnited Nations was founded. Since the fall of the powerful empires the political map has changed very drastically with the emergence of many new nation States. This is clearly demonstrated by the membership of this Organization. Whereas there were only 51 Members originally  today there are 159.As far as economic and social development is concerned; science and technology have advanced the ways and means by which human conditions can be improved. Man has reached the moon and space exploration is no longer fiction. New and sophisticated weaponry is being manufactured constantly and the threat of the total destruction of the world is not unimaginable. In these circumstances  promise and despair loom with equal importance on the horizon. As the Secretary-General rightly points out in his 1985 report  ""The choice between these alternatives is ours"" (A/40/1  p. 2). This must be our challenge for the future.The United Nations has been criticized in some quarters for failing to live and work in accordance with its principal aim: the maintenance of international peace and security. It has been said by some critics  for instance  that the General Assembly often gets so bogged down in political bickering that it loses sight of the objective of resolving the problems that come before it.Also  it has been claimed that the Organization as a whole has become too politicized. While X cannot challenge such assertions  I venture to say that chief among its many successes is its very survival over the past 40 years and that in pursuing its primary function  the maintenance of international peace and security  we have averted a third world war.Thus  in reflecting on the past 40 years I do not wish to look at the negative aspects of our Organization; rather I wish to look at where we should go from here  building on our strengths. I believe that we should look at the future with more determination and confidence to make the ""United Nations for a better world"".Solomon Islands is a young Member of this august body. We joined in September 1978  but it was not until July 1984 that we were able to have a Permanent Mission here.This situation was of course not a reflection of the highest regard we had for the United Nations  its Members and agencies. It was simply due to our lack of financial and manpower resources.Our becoming a Member has been fundamental to our foreign relations policy. As a small island-nation  we see the United Nations as the best forum in which to safeguard our interests in our dealings with the international community  both bilaterally and multilaterally. Our Permanent Mission here is our very first overseas diplomatic mission. Our having given this post top priority reflects two important points. First  by being here we can  through daily contacts with other Member States  have consultations on a host of subjects of interest to our nation and region and to the international community. Where there are divergences we can explain our differences; and where there are conflicting viewpoints we are better able to understand and appreciate the positions of others. Secondly  we attach great importance to the work of the United Nations and its many agencies in all spheres of development - political  economic  social and cultural - for the overall betterment of the global community  especially the developing countries. It is a fact that even before our becoming a Member we were already receiving assistance from a number of United Nations agencies.But after becoming a Member we have come to realize that there is so much more we can receive to improve our lot in order the better to con tribute to the United Nations and the international community. We realize our limitations and shortcomings as a small island-nation  but we do have faith and hope in the United Nations. We believe that the United Nations has a vital role to play in the future of the world 40 or SO years or a century hence. The experience of the past 40 years clearly shows this. So much more good could be done if the future role of the United Nations could be clearly defined  understood  appreciated and pursued with positive action.In this regard I believe it is worth while to reflect on the Secretary-General's proposition that""A basic role of the United Nations... is to serve as the foundation on which to build the international system of the future  a system fully recognizing national sovereignty but also recognizing that some of our present realities and concerns call urgently for something more"" (A/40/1  p. 4) - that is  something more than the present arrangements under which this Organization has been working.This is a challenging proposition; it deserves that we all give it seriousconsideration. To a considerable degree it questions the applicability of theCharter of the United Nations and the respect we have for it  both as individual sovereign States and collectively as the international community.The most important areas that require consideration are the authority of the General Assembly and the role of the Security Council. It does seem that in many cases decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly can be acted upon only by those Members that support them  but can be ignored by others. Perhaps this is so because of self-centered national interests based on the principle that national sovereignty necessarily is above the authority of the General Assembly. If so  then surely this must be an issue that warrants careful consideration.The veto provision in the Security Council and the ineffective application of the Council's decisions and resolutions also require thorough assessment. This important organ  well-intentioned as it is  has been handicapped by its caste system - permanent members and non-permanent members - and the undemocratic practice of vetoing important decisions by those who have the potential power to bring total destruction to the world. It is ironical that  while we deplore totalitarian and autocratic practices  the Security Council is given authority to adhere to them by the veto provision.In the proposed discussion of the membership of the Security Council this veto problem should be reviewed with a view to democratizing the decision-making process of the Council.There are other areas and aspects of the United Nations system that could be reviewed. For instance  will the informal regional groupings be as relevant in the future? We do not understand  for instance  why Australia and New Zealand  two very good and friendly countries in the South Pacific region  are members of the Group of Western European and other States while their neighbors - Fiji  Papua New Guinea  Samoa  Vanuatu and Solomon Islands - belong to the Group of Asian States. And what about the protocols that require permanent residency here at the seat of the Organization before accredited representatives of Member States can be recognized? Is there not room for flexibility in these ever-changing times?Those are some of the questions I consider worth pondering over  on our road to the twenty-first century  as the only Organization that is capable of bringing all of us together in spite of our great diversity.There are still immediate problems: political problems in southern Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Central America; and economic problems the world over  but more pressingly in the third-world countries. We must deal with them  and it is hoped that we shall do so in a new spirit of equal partnership and with a unifying dedication to humanity.My Government is committed to the total eradication of the evil system of apartheid in South Africa. In terms of sanctions  our record can speak for itself. We have no contacts whatsoever with that racist regime. We see no sense or logic in collaborating with a Government which degrades human dignity. The perpetuation of minority supremacy over democracy must end.In regard to Namibia  ray Government fully supports the granting of independence at the earliest possible opportunity in line with the Namibian people's desire and the international community's overwhelming support.The search for a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict has become ever more urgent. While Solomon Islands recognizes Israel's right to exist  we also subscribe to the principle of a homeland for the Palestinian people. We again urge the parties concerned to pursue the search for peace in that region as the ultimate goal.The war between Iran and Iraq has entered its fifth year  with no peaceful settlement in sight. The prolongation of that war has caused much loss of life. It is our earnest hope and prayer that lasting peace can be negotiated as soon as possible.Today we renew our strong condemnation of the occupation of Afghanistan by foreign forces. This is the sixth year and the Soviet Union has demonstrated its unwillingness to allow the return of democracy to that country. Solomon Islands deplores that act of aggression and regards it as a hallmark of tyranny and neo-colonialism.As a neighboring ""country of East Asia  Solomon Islands considers peace and security in that region as most fundamental to its own development and progress. Thus  we are concerned about the occupation of Kampuchea by foreign forces which is a real threat to our own peace and security. Again  we call for the total withdrawal of all foreign forces so that democracy can take its proper course as desired by the Kampuchean people. In this respect  we will continue to support the initiative of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to achieve this objective.The situation in the Korean Peninsula also requires the attention of the United Nations in so far as the admission of those two countries as members is concerned. The reunification process is an important objective  but we genuinely feel that admitting both Koreas into this body is fundamental to facilitating reunification  which should be pursued without outside interference.In Central and South America  the re-establishment of democratic Governments in some countries is an encouraging development. It is our hope that the conflict in Nicaragua will soon be resolved amicably by the parties involved and not through pressure from outside.The South Pacific is a very special region: it contains some of the smallest independent States in the world and  most importantly  it is peaceful. We want it to remain peaceful. Our island States are scattered over a very wide area  thus making communication difficult. We have limited resources for industrial development. But we depend heavily on our sea and marine resources. That is why we are concerned about nuclear testing and super-Power rivalry in our region. And that is why we have to turn to the United Nations to safeguard our interests.We have been expressing  in the strongest possible terms  our condemnation of nuclear testing in the South Pacific region. We have in fact  individually and collectively  through the South Pacific Forum  voiced this to the French Government  but the response from it has always been one of disregard of the views and concerns of the Governments of the South Pacific region.It is indeed very sad that a permanent member of the Security Council  the United Nations organ which is given the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  should continue in this most inhumane manner to disregard the unanimous call of South Pacific Governments to discontinue itsnuclear testing in our region. It has been claimed time and again that this nuclear testing program poses no danger to our environment and livelihood. If so  why cannot the French Government carry out its tests in France? While France continues to claim sovereignty over Polynesia  it must be reminded that its claim is colonialist in all respects and most unacceptable to the independent States of the South Pacific region.It is most displeasing that while the universal desire is for disarmament that same permanent member of the Security Council is proceeding with a new military buildup in New Caledonia. Solomon Islands condemns and deplores that action and earnestly calls on the French Government to think more about the peace and security of the people in the South Pacific region instead of its own imperialist interests.In this connection  it is sad to note that terrorist activities are now infiltrating our region. The first case of this was the sinking of the""Greenpeace"" vessel - the ""Rainbow Warrior"" - in Auckland  New Zealand  earlier this year. One innocent man was killed as a result of that premeditated action. It is now public knowledge  as recently announced by the French Prime Minister  that certain high authorities of the French Government were responsible for ordering the bombing of that vessel.The South Pacific nuclear-free zone Treaty has already been mentioned by our neighbors in the region. That is an important Treaty for all of us in the south Pacific. Although Solomon Islands has not signed it as yet  we are carefully re-examining certain technicalities in relation to overall policy on nuclear-powered and nuclear-carFying craft.Our policy in this respect is simple and straightforward. Solomon Islands will not allow any vessels and aircraft which are nuclear powered or are capable of carrying nuclear weapons into its waters  airspace and ports  taking into account  of course  the provisions of international law for free and innocent passage. This is consistent with the principle that we do not subscribe to the development and use of devices for human destruction.We expect other States to respect this policy on the basis of genuine friendship and for the benefit of future generations. In fact  it demonstrates our firm adherence to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter as enshrined in its Preamble and in Article 1. Any nuclear-weapon States which find this position difficult to accommodate will be most welcome for bilateral discussions over our differences.Armament and development in this modern nuclear age can never be anything but incompatible. Solomon Islands has been repeatedly calling for realistic disarmament by the super-Powers. He sincerely hope  therefore  that the Geneva talks between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union will set thescene and establish the sign-posts for the pursuit and attainment of this important objective of realistic disarmament.I feel it is most appropriate  in this context  to reiterate our continuing concern over budgetary allocations for military purposes. It is most disconcerting to note  year after year  that these budgets keep on rising to billions of dollars. This year alone the world will have spent $US 1 000 billion for military purposes.As noted in the 1985 Third-World Lecture by the recipient of the Third-World Prize  Willy Brandt  ""This amounts to a death sentence for millions of human beings.""To the small islands States  with annual total national budgets which are far less titan departmental budgets of the industrialized nations  this type of expenditure is a cur-e on our human development efforts for agricultural improvements  education  basic health services  clean water supplies and modest economic infrastructures. Obviously  there is a serious imbalance between development  especially in third-world countries  and military build-ups in and by the industrialized States. This is certainly inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations in terms of international co-operation for solving economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems.Decolonization is one field to which the United Nations has contributed so significantly and successfully in the past 40 years  especially since the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Inthe South Pacific the independent island States case through this transition quite peacefully. The process  however  is still incomplete  especially in areas administered by Prance.Some other island groups have special arrangements. These are: Cook Islands and Nuie which have democratically chosen to remain self-governing in free association with New Zealand; in the case of the Tokelau Atoll Territory  the people still wish to remain under New Zealand administration which  in line with United Nations trusteeship requirements  reports regularly on developments there; and American Samoa  of course  by the express wish of the people  still remains a United States possession.To the north of the equator are the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands. As is well known  they are working out with the United States the best possible arrangements for their future political and constitutional status. In connection with these Territories I wish to express  on behalf of my government and people  our deep sorrow over the assassination of the former President of Palau. The circumstances that surround this unfortunate incident remain unclear  but it is our sincere hope that it will not lead to delaying the appropriate type of progress being sought by the people of Palau and the United States Government.While the decolonization story in our region during the past two decades could be regarded as a happy and smooth one  the situation now is not the same. Events that occurred in New Caledonia in the very recent past have tarnished the scene with bloodshed and loss of lives.My Government fully supports independence for all colonial peoples andTerritories. Hence we support independence for all Pacific island Territories  asexpressly desired by their peoples.In the case of New Caledonia  we applaud the stand that the only sensible road to future peace in this Territory is independence  which in our terms does not mean independence in free association with another political entity. I am  therefore  urging the French Government speedily to develop New Caledonia as an independent  sovereign State  In my view  the first step is to subscribe to the principle and logic of consulting the appropriate organs of the United Nations in the pursuit of the decolonization of this Territory.I am pleased that recently elections were held and the majority of the indigenous population of New Caledonia was able to take part. The results revealed the Kanaks' genuine determination to decide on their own affairs and future destiny.These results also dispelled  once and for all  the misleading propaganda that pro-independence groups were not a representative force in New Caledonia. They also showed  overall  that there is a fundamental need for electoral reform which must precede the proposed referendum. I sincerely hope that France  with its resourcefulness  will not fail to ensure an electoral system that will guarantee the inalienable rights of the Kanaks and those others who genuinely wish to make New Caledonia their home.The United Nations and other multilateral organizations are the springboard for international and regional co-operation. The establishment of our permanent mission here exemplifies this. Hence  we are most grateful to our Commonwealth friends for supporting Australia's financial assistance to establish and maintain the facilities which now house our mission along with those of Maldives  Samoa and Vanuatu.In terms of international co-operation  the law of the sea Convention is very important to Solomon Islands as an island nation. Regional co-operation among the South Pacific countries is fundamental to the development of our fisheries and marine resources. The South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency  which is based in Solomon Islands  and the South Pacific Commission with its headquarters in New Caledonia  are assisting considerably in co-ordinating the management and conservation of and research in our fisheries. I note with interest the United States willingness to co-operate with us in the development of our fisheries. This kind gesture was announced in this Assembly by the Honorable George Shultz  the United States Secretary of State  on 23 September 1985 in these words:""We are joining with them in a dedicated effort to negotiate quickly a regional fisheries agreement that will benefit all"". (A/40/PV.4  p. 48) It is our sincere and earnest hope that these negotiations will not be marred by any domineering attitude for the mere attainment of superiority over our small States. Furthermore  we hope to come up with an agreement which will be fair to all  and that will provide for the recognition and acceptance of our sovereignty over our various 200-mile fisheries and exclusive economic zones.When I addressed this Assembly in September 1978 on the admission of Solomon Islands as a Member  I declared our commitment to the United Nations and the principles of our Charter.Today I reaffirm that commitment. And today I humbly urge that we all  duringthis International Youth Year  rededicate this worthy Organization to our young generations  whose future happiness is our responsibility."
"111",6250,"SLE",40,1985,"Permit me on behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation and on my own account  to extend to Mr. de Piniés heartiest congratulations on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its fortieth session. His long experience within this Organization as his country's representative for an appreciable period assures us of the qualities he possesses as a diplomat and a distinguished statesman. Undoubtedly those attributes qualify him to guide our deliberations during this historic session to a successful conclusion.Allow me also to express my delegation's appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  for the able and devoted manner in which he bore the responsibilities of President of the General Assembly at the thirty-ninth session. My delegation applauds his efforts to achieve the objectives of our Organization.I also commend our Secretary-General and his staff for their tireless efforts to help us achieve the aims and objectives of our Organization.On behalf of my delegation  I wish to join those who have preceded me in expressing profound sympathy with the people of Mexico on the devastating earthquakes which struck their country. We support the call for assistance to meet both the short- and long-term needs of Mexico.Forty years ago  concerned as the international community was about the prospects for peace and security in that turbulent world  the signatories to the Charter of the United Nations did not fail to recognize the urgent and burning need to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples. To that end  we created institutions which over the last 40 years have attested to our commitment to the international consensus on the duties and obligations of States and individuals in the furtherance any achievement of the noble aims and objectives of the United Nations.Forty years later  as we today review and appraise our progress in the realization of the ideals and goals of the institutions we created  we are also compelled to make an overall assessment of the policies  progresses and mechanisms which we have utilized to realize those objectives. It is my hope that this fortieth session of the General Assembly will make an honest and realistic evaluation of our successes and inadequacies.The fortieth session of the General Assembly sits uncomfortably amidst renewed uncertainties about the direction  the strength and the pace of the world economy. To be sure  we have witnessed since the founding of this Organization a great upsurge in economic output. The world has seen massive changes. Our lives have been rapidly transformed by new discoveries  new ideas and new technology. The growth in output and the changes attendant on technological development have engendered a new optimism. Unfortunately  the events have belied the promise. Erratic exchange rates  trade imbalances  heavy debt burdens  increased population  the problem of food and the policies of certain institutions and Governments have visibly eroded our optimistic expectations. It is against this backdrop that the economies of countries like Sierra Leone have stagnated and  indeed  even yielded negative growth rates over the last five years or so. However  we still cherish the hope that it is not beyond the imagination and intellectual capacity  or even the will  of this Assembly to proffer solutions to these apparently intractable problems.It is ray delegation's humble view that if the salvation of the world economy is to be assured the international community must recognize the need for concerted action by a large group of countries which  together  can provide the necessary impetus to the world's engine of growth. What we observe today  however  is that certain institutions prescribe specific policy reforms for developing countries that impose undue hardship on their populations and  consequently  produce social and political instability  a condition that makes it impossible to achieve sustained economic growth. However  those institutions should be aware that the successful implementation of their strategies and policies in any particular country depends to a considerable extent on other factors in the international environment. Such factors often include the domestic policies of individual Governments in the developed market economies.How  one must ask  can the economy of a developing country like Sierra Leone successfully realize the objectives of these strategies and policies when deliberate policy-induced actions on the part of some States can  at best  frustrate the main endeavors of many developing countries. Those institutions must also know that such actions constitute a retreat from the multilateral consensus in which we all joined when we proclaimed  a little over.- a decade ago  the advent of the new international economic order. This is hardly what delegations in this Assembly would wish to encourage. It is our moral duty to arrest and reverse any retreat from multi-lateralism.He express the hope that Governments and international institutions will muster the courage and broaden their vision to enhance the bold and concerted efforts necessary for the creation of the appropriate economic climate. It would also be desirable for international institutions to modify their policies to reflect the prevailing circumstances in the developing economies.Earlier this year the Assembly of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity which met in Addis Ababa reviewed the critical economic situation in Africa. He as developing countries cannot ignore the fact that the present economic situation is certainly in part attributable to some domestic-policy shortcomings. In short  some developing countries can alleviate their present difficulties by taking positive remedial action on the domestic front. We must not and should not spare ourselves this valid self-criticism.But even for those who were already self-consciously critical  unpredictable disasters in the form of persistent drought  famine and other natural calamities considerably exacerbated their already-precarious pattern of life. Having said that  we must also add that all developing countries and the international community can and must take preemptive action to mitigate the worst effects of some of these calamities.We may give sustained attention and offer profound and convincing analyses of our economic  social and industrial problems; we can define our parameters  programs  policies and targets; none of these can have much significance without the human element. Mankind remains at the center of global activity.The development and enhancement of this fundamental and truly indispensable resource should remain a principal concern of our Organization. Regrettably  disturbing levels of illiteracy  high infant mortality  poor intellectual and technical skills and inadequate and ineffective research techniques still characterize the social conditions prevailing in many developing countries. No form of meaningful socio-economic and political development can ever take place without a proper assessment  an appropriate recognition and the further development of our human-resource potential.Four decades have elapsed since the most devastating global confrontation in mankind's history. The founding of the United Nations was regarded as a manifestation of the desire for peaceful coexistence among nations and a demonstration of man's determination never again to engage la any brutal encounter of such magnitude. But has the United Nations been entirely successful in ensuring peace and saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war? Is the united Nations still regarded as the guardian of peace and security in this constantly turbulent world? Evidently we have in many ways failed to adhere to the aims and objectives of the Organization in r \ear violation of its Charter. Many States have resorted to measures in total disregard of their obligations under the Charter and in pursuance of their own specific objectives at the expense of international peace and security.My delegation is concerned over the renewed escalation of the arms race  particularly in nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. This concern is further heightened by the continued research  testing  production and deployment of such deadly weapons  leading to an intensification of super-Power rivalry. It is for this reason that my delegation looks forward to the conclusion of effective agreements between the super-Powers aimed at preventing the further escalation of the arms race. It is hoped that the current round of discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union will create the necessary atmosphere to lead to the reduction of international tension.Our Organization speaks for millions  and we who are gathered here today must face and resolutely come to terms with the critical issues of our time with moral courage and principled determination. The evidence of an unsettled world is too visible to catalog. South Africa continues to perpetuate its mindless and immoral policy of racial discrimination while it imposes its illegal and colonial domination on Namibia. The problem of the Middle East  with particular regard to Palestine  continues to defy solution. The Korean Peninsula remains divided and the the Korean people are deprived of their natural heritage and legitimate right to live together in peace. Foreign troops in both Afghanistan and Kampuchea have brought chaos and destruction to those countries  and Central America remains a volatile region of the world.The paramount political and moral issue of concern to Sierra Leone is the question of South Africa and Namibia. He have lived with the arrogant  insolent and violent apartheid regime for too long* We have witnessed that regime's increasing military strength  which it has used aggressively against its neighbors in the region and to keep Namibia in oppression. We have witnessed the South African regime's brutalizing its black citizens  restricting their movement  depriving them of their social  economic and political rights in their motherland  concentrating them into tribal homelands - all with the tacit support of some of South Africa's Western allies.South Africa's latest arrogant action on Namibia is the establishment of an interim government  which totally precludes the participation of the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAFO)  which is regarded by the international community as the sole  legitimate representative of the Namibian people. This action is also in contradiction of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is regarded as the basis for any solution of the Namibian problem. We condemn unreservedly this blatant disregard of international decisions by South Africa.In the face of South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia  and in the face of that illegal regime's wanton and brutal violence against its own people  it remains the responsibility of this Organization  based on the Charter  to impose forthwith comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the illegal colonial regime. In this connection the Government of Sierra Leone wishes to commend all those nations which have taken steps to impose economic sanctions against South Africa  and in particular to applaud the Government of France  which  in the face of criticism from some of its allies  took the courageous and independent initiative of applying economic sanctions against the intolerable apartheid regime. He implore all those nations which are still ambivalent on the issue of sanctions to conform to the realities of the South African problem.The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a threat to international peace and security and remains a cause of constant concern to this Organization. Thirty-eight years after the adoption of General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 1947  we still await its full implementation. That resolution took a clear and definitive decision on the establishment of both an Israeli and a Palestinian State. Unfortunately the State of Palestine is still not in existence  and Israel continues to occupy certain Arab territories.My delegation reiterates its call for the establishment of a Palestinian State  for the immediate unconditional and total withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We reject M political  economic and military support that encourages Israel to perpetuate its occupation and annexation of Arab territories.In Afghanistan and Kampuchea we see a clear violation of the principles and purposes of our Organization. The occupation of foreign territories by force of arms in pursuance of the political beliefs and interests of certain Member States is totally in violation of the principles of the Charter.The massive flow of refugees consequent upon the crises in those two regions has caused enormous social and economic difficulties for the receiving States.Sierra Leone continues to maintain a firm stance in calling for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea and for their peoples to be given an opportunity to choose their own governments and build their future free from foreign interference. We must remember that freedom is indivisible. A loss of freedom anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere. A call for the freedom of any people must be supported by a call for the freedom of all people. We cannot and must not lose sight of that noble ideal  which is the heritage of all humanity. My Government has followed with keen interest the course of events in the Korean peninsula over the years. He have taken note of the efforts being made by both North and South Korea to achieve a better understanding between them  and we welcome the program of exchange visits by Korean families. It is our view that these developments augur well for better and closer co-operation between the peoples and Governments of both sides. In addition  based on the principle of universality  and with a view to lessening tension in the Korean peninsula and creating a forum for greater understanding between the two States  we support the call for the admission of the two Koreas to membership of the United Nations without any prejudice to the attainment of their long-term objective.In conclusion I should like to recall here the words of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization to the fortieth session  in which he states:""In our journey of 40 years we have had many experiences  some encouraging  others frustrating  and many that have been deeply enlightening."" (A/40/1  p. 16)Sierra Leone was not there when that journey began 40 years ago. But this Organization  by its now famous resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960s on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  created a new awareness that colonialism had no place in tile modern world. That Declaration inspired a marked increase in the membership of this Organization and enabled a country such as Sierra Leone to assume a place in this council of nations. This in our view is a vindication of the tremendous foresight of the founding fathers of this Organization  for despite is vicissitudes the United Nations remains the main instrument for the attainment of international peace and security and for the economic and social progress of all our peoples. Let us therefore rededicate ourselves anew in our determination to uphold the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of our Organization. For only in this way can international peace and security and economic and social progress be attained by all our peoples."
"112",6296,"SLV",40,1985,"Mr. President  permit fee to convey to you my most sincere congratulations on having assumed the presidency of the fortieth regular session of the General Assembly. 1 am firmly convinced that your diplomatic skill and experience guarantee the successful outcome of our work. It is also a great pleasure for me to see that a distinguished citizen of Spain  a country to which we owe so much and admire is presiding over the proceedings of this important body.I also wish to renew my gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for his efforts for world peace in a context in which the international situation is increasingly complex.I wish to express the sympathy and solidarity of my people and Government with the people and Government of Mexico for the natural disaster they suffered a few days ago. El Salvador will stand side by side with Mexico at this moment of tragedy  and offers its full and unreserved co-operation as a Latin American sister State that has the same concerns  sufferings  ideals and hopes.It is an honor for me to appear for the first time at the plenary meeting of this important body  where problems are raised  and positions and solutions are outlined that give rise to various expectations relating to the diverse and pressing conflicts which characterize the historical dynamics of the world society. This is especially true at this time when we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  whose purposes and principles continue to have the same relevance and importance as in 1945  in view of the precarious state of the world system and the constant threats to international peace and security.Despite the fact that the scope of action of the Organization has expanded  riot only in geographical terns but also because of the increasing number  varied nature and complexity of the international problems it must deal with  and although its strength and effectiveness depend on the will of all Member States  particularly that of the highly developed countries  the efforts and achievements over these 40 years make me feel hope and faith that we can arrive  at a united international community which will allow us to improve the situation of our peoples and our nations  on the basis of the universal application of the key principles of social justice and international law which in their various aspects  are the foundations of social harmony  unity  security and permanent peace.The situation in Central America has received great attention in the international community in recent years. That is why  at this time  as did Mi. Jose Napoleon Duarte  the constitutional President of the Republic of El Salvador  in 1984  I believe it appropriate and very important to present and clarify before the delegations of the world  certain matters relating to our internal order  such as progress made in the political process  measures and efforts to consolidate democracy  and my country's perception and position regarding the regional crisis  all of which are determining factors in formulating our policies.Other causes of concern are the international problems and conflicts of all kinds which affect the political  economic and social structure of each of the members of the international society and which have been described in detail by previous speakers. I wish to present the position of El Salvador on various important aspects of international politics.El Salvador's international relations are based on a policy of principle  in keeping with what we believe should constitute a just and harmonious international society  based on understanding  good faith and loyal co-operation  rather than on inequality  alienation and the exploitation of peoples.Moreover  El Salvador  as a small and underdeveloped country  faces serious internal and external challenges which threaten our identity  sense of independence and freedom and are caused by groups bent on gaining power through the force of arms  resorting to terrorist action through external interference and anti-democratic ideological penetration.At the international level  1 consider it necessary to reiterate the importance of struggling to ensure that relations among peoples and nations develop on the basis of doctrinal positions which ensure the application of international law  especially such basic principles as the juridical equality of States  the self-determination of peoples  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  universality and democratization of international relations  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the defense of civil and political rights  and other principles respect for which by nations would result in harmonious relationships that could at the same time be the foundations of peace and co-operation  the necessary preconditions of attaining the objectives of better international social justice.No one in this forum is unaware of U.e inequalities which exist in small underdeveloped countries or the difficulties they face in trying to solve the principal problems affecting and impeding their development. An essential factor in this connection id the concept of the international dimension of development  in which a new international economic order must cease to be a dream and become a reality  in order to correct the unequal relations between States  which have been at the root of the great inequalities and some of the main tensions from which the international community suffers.Therefore^ we strive not only for a restructuring of the terms of trade and the elimination of protectionist barriers in industrialized countries  but also for the free flow of information  the transfer of science and technology  a change in forms of co-operation so as to bring them into line with the requirements of development and thus overcome such problems as that of the foreign debt  which limit and prevent progress in our countries and become elements of pressure and serious social and political instability.That is why we agree that the question of the debt should be given special priority  not only in an economic but also in a political context  in a dialog in which financial consideration should give way to aspects of social justice as the only path to internal peace and to the preservation of democratic institutions.This spirit of understanding  solidarity and co-operation could be more evident in the context of the Worth-South dialog  in which El Salvador stands in solidarity with the other developing countries which 	in the Group of 77  take action for the promotion and adoption of development measures.We believe that this process of change would be the best way gradually to resolve the various problems and tensions which beset the world. Nevertheless  1 most reiterate and emphasize that achievements and progress will only be possible if strong bonds of awareness  solidarity and international co-operation are Corned  to break the chains of backwardness and poverty that afflict most peoples of the worId.In that same context  we advocate just economic models and processes of integration to minimize economic inequality and the gap between the rich and the poor countries as necessary foundations for international harmony and security.Despite the will and the efforts of the United Nations  the international country is continuously threatened by the specter of a large-scale war  by the existence of conflicts and tensions and by actions which violate the provision of the Charter and endanger international peace and security.I wish to reiterate our faith in and support for not only the purposes and principles of the Charter  but also the Organization itself  without which the ideal of peace and a better world for mankind would be less likely to be fulfilled.I believe it appropriate to refer specifically to some of the problems of concern to the international community.With regard to disarmament  my delegation expresses its concern and regret that efforts to halt the arms race have not more significant progress. On the contrary  there has been a considerable increase in budgets for research into and production of more destructive weapons  conventional as well as nuclear  while  paradoxically  we live in a world in which a high percentage of the population suffers from hunger and poverty.However  we see a ray of hope in the meeting to be held in November in Geneva between the President of the United Status and the leader of the soviet Union. My country hopes that it nay be as fruitful as possible  since  not only the strategic relationship between the two super-Powers   but also matters which affect the fats of the other peoples of the planet are at stake.We wish to reaffirm our condemnation of the South African regime for its policy of apartheid  and we appeal to the United Nations and the international community to adopt the necessary measures as provided for in the Charter to help put an end to a policy which is a source of shame for mankind.We are also concerned by the situation in Namibia and the failure to achieve the purposes of Security Council resolution 435 (1973). This lack of progress is more significant than ever this year when we <re celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United nations Declaration on decolonization.With regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict  the protracted and intensifying conflict between these two countries  which has resulted in considerable loss of life and Material damage and threatens to involve neighboring countries  continue to be a cause of concern to the international community. We believe that the countries involved must seek formulas that will bring thee closer together and initiate negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the conflict.The situation in Afghanistan shows the hegemonistic behavior of a major Power  contrary to the aspirations and rights of a people where independence and self-determination should be restored. He therefore reaffirm our support for the efforts wade by the Secretary-General to find a political solution to that conflict  we hope that the countries involved will comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions in particular the resolution on the withdrawal of the occupation forces and respect for the right of the Afghan people to decide its own destiny.Our position on the problem of the Middle East has been consistent. We reject and condemn all action it and positions which violate the provisions of the Charter and resolutions of the Security Council and which create a climate of instability and insecurity for all the countries of the region and stand in the way of a comprehensive just and lasting solution  we agree that the central factor of the conflict is the question of Palestine. Thus we express our support for the Palestinian people and the hope that it will be enabled to exercise its inalienable rights  including their right to self-determination. Likewise we support universal recognition of the existence of the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.My delegation cannot but express its concern and regret that the efforts to achieve peace in Lebanon have not been successful  and we note that there has been a resurgence of the conflict. Thus we advocate that foreign interference be terminated and that the internal forces in conflict recognize the need to arrive at an understanding  so that it nay regain its status as a free  sovereign and independent State  the sufferings of the noble Lebanese people will be brought to an end and its right will be restored to decide the type of social and political system that best meets its aspirations.The situation in Kampuchea represents a clear violation of the principles  purposes and resolutions of the United Nations. El Salvador believes that to arrive at a just and lasting solution it is essential that the foreign military forces withdraw from the occupied territories and that there be a cessation of acts of intervention in the internal affairs of the country  in order to restore the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea.Just as there are situations and attitudes which are contrary to international peace and security  there are also events which are worthy of praise and promote confidence and amity among peoples and nations. In this context we find promising the progress achieved recently in relations between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a process aimed at maintaining constant dialog and arriving at understanding so as progressively to reduce tension in the area. The Government of EI Salvador welcomes these attitudes and is encouraged by these signs of goodwill  while the Government of 31 Salvador recognizes the noble efforts guiding the dialog  it recognizes that the United Nations must help to encourage such bilateral discussions in order that the conditions may be gradually brought about for the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. It considers that a factor likely to contribute to promoting dialog and a peaceful settlement can be found in the acquisition of rights and duties derived from admission to membership in the United Nations. On the basis of these criteria and the principle of universality characterizing the Organization  the Government of El Salvador supports any request the Government of the Republic of Korea might submit for fall membership of the United Nations.My Government reiterates its solidarity with and support for the sister Republic of Argentina in its dispute with the United Kingdom over the Malvinas Islands and appeals to both countries to resume negotiations with a view to finding at the earliest possible date a peaceful and just solution to the problem.I shall now refer to the determining factors of our policy in the historic times in which we live. Against the designs  terrorist action* and historical interpretations of the extreme left and the extreme right with regard to our process of democratization  which began in 1979  strengthened and legitimized through the elections to a constituent assembly in 1982  national elections in 1984 and elections for representatives and municipal officials this year  my Government has remained convinced that it is possible to promote a democratic process which responds to the will and the interests oL the people oC El Salvador within a political and philosophical Crane of action. In that context  pluralism  representation  participation  social justice  equity and the common good are the elements of stability which bind together the various elements of a new society in which the individual and the community as a whole are the ultimate beneficiaries of a social and national action  as laid down in our political constitution  thus offering a national historical alternative to the crisis and offering options for the peaceful and comprehensive settlement  likely to contribute to consolidation of the process and the new democratic institutions of the Republic. To consolidate this process  we are developing and perfecting the most comprehensive agrarian reform in Latin America. We are nationalizing the banking and financial systems and also nationalizing foreign trade  in order to channel our policies and resources towards the building of a more just  democratic  participatory and. unified society which strives for the common good of the body politic s a whole and for the individual as an essential part of that whole.To ensure the common good we must guarantee the economic benefits of labor  property and the distribution of wealth based on parameters that are focused on principles of justice and equity. These are the foundations of our economic policy  and that is why we are implementing economic measures which regulate the obtaining of excessive profits from the production process by minority groups to the detriment of the economy of the larger majority  without that constituting an attempt to nationalize or centralize the sources of production. Thus  approximately 90 000 families today own the best and most productive land in the country  and they form the basis of the social sectors of the economy. The State supports them through training and technical and financial assistance.Ma  ace developing the production of alternative sources of energy based on sugar cane  ensuring markets and prices for its production  fie ore also increasing the production of alcohol as fuel in order to reduce our dependence on supplies of energy.As part of our agricultural policy  peasant leaders freely elected by their organizations preside over the two basic agencies which guide the agrarian reform process. Peasant trade-union organizations enjoy direct participation in financial* practical assistance and training institutions. Lastly  all agrarian reform projects are implemented under the control of peasant leaders.We have democratized the credit system  not only in the granting of credits but also in controlling the system and 49 per cent of the activities of the banking and financial institutions are in the hands of the private sector. At the same time  we are decentralizing  modernizing and increasing lines of credit to the popular sectors.We should point out that within our humanitarian and social policies ay Government  in co-operation with the United Nations Children's Fund (0NXC8F) and other international bodies  this year promoted a successful national campaign of child immunization  which is even more significant for having been carried out in an atmosphere of conflict. Therefore my Government appeals to the international community to support the noble goal of the United Nations to achieve universal immunization of all children in the world by 1990.In a world in which the rights of man are so often violated  the protection and full promotion of human rights is a fundamental part of my Government's philosophy. This is clearly stated in our Constitution. These principles are the basis of our highest aspirations  in view of the history of approbrium  repression and alienation suffered by the majority sectors of our population. Thus  as part of our political programs full implementation of those eights is one of the main objectives. They are essential to the human person and they are the basis for democratic reality based on the human being and on the respect and protection of his inalienable rights.To these ends  under Legislative Decree No. 53  recently enacted  a law was adopted establishing a commission to investigate criminal acts. The Commission has been entrusted with investigating crimes which because of their recurrence have serious repercussions on the public and social order of the country.To guarantee the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Salvadoran people we have promoted the active teaching and institutional promulgation of international instruments relating to human rights to which El Salvador is a party.My Government is ethically committed to improve the situation of the people of El Salvador respecting human rights and  to that end  it has undertaken major efforts to reform the judicial system. It has already set up the Special Review Commission on the Judicial System and it hopes that there will shortly be greater capacity and efficiency in that system in accordance with the wishes of the Salvadorian people.These efforts are not  however* recognized. On the contrary  they are  violently questioned by extremists  who  guided by ideas contrary to our historical and cultural identity and our democratic aspirations  wish to obtain power through violence  inspiring terror and causing destruction through the illegal and irrational use of force.My Government  under its President  Mr. Jose Napollon Duarte  has adopted measures and provisions which have considerably improved the enjoyment of those rights  which will progressively and gradually improve as the internal situation becomes more normal throughout the national territory. This view is shared by various governments and organizations which have studied the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador and have recognized the efforts we are making.Governments are traditionally charged with violations of human rights  in particular  for political and ideological reasons. In the case of El Salvador  various Governments and international public and private organizations have noted and recognized that groups of armed opposition to the legally constituted Government have violated the fundamental human rights of our people.In that regard  X believe it appropriate to put before the conscience of the representatives here and to draw the attention of this forum to two recent events in El Salvador which have shocked public opinion and which have been condemned by various national and international sectors. I as referring to the kidnapping by the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation-Democratic Revolutionary Front (EMLN-FDR) of more than 21 mayors of cities in the eastern part of the country who were freely and democratically elected by the people in the elections held in March of this year; and more recently still  the kidnapping of Mrs. Znes Guadalupe Duarte Duran  the daughter of the President of the Republic - clearly an atrocity -and an act in which Miss Ana Cecilia Villeda Sosa was also kidnapped and one member of her security force was murdered and another seriously wounded. This action also endangered other lives. These activities  because of their form and nature  are clearly typical terrorist actions and constitute a violation of the rights and fundamental freedoms of the human being.Also  such action presupposes sick ethics which  contradictory as it may seem  occurs when guerrilla terrorists attempt to justify their criminal behavior as revolutionary acts cloaked in a fictional morality in which no one any longer believes.Thus  we request the firm solidarity of the international community to condemn any form and type of terrorism  whether national or international  in order to promote the universal protection o£ human rights. We are convinced that specific interests and ideological and political opposition cannot justify support for acts which are repudiated by the international community  such as kidnapping and criminal attacks against innocent people for political purposes.With a clear determination and the hope for a better future for the people ofEl Salvador  we have made important efforts covering five major objectives which are essential guidelines to attain peace  the basic aspiration of the Salvadorian people.Our efforts are aimed at bringing about a humanization of the conflict peace  based on sincere  not opportunistic  dialog democratization  stimulating the participation of all social sectors in a pluralist society the participation of the people in the decision-making of the Government through the social covenant we have proposed to the nation} and economic recovery  aimed at stabilizing our economy with the basic purpose of facing up to the problems that affect the majority of the people.At the same time we are trying to extirpate the structural roots of social violence. We have accepted the challenge to humanize the conflict  against the armed opposition  which  through an obsolete interpretation of historical reality  has decided to continue with its strategy of protracted popular war  devoting itself to indiscriminate terrorism in various forms  such as sabotage and the destruction of human lives and public and private property  in a senseless and unpatriotic desire to block and distort the democratic process  which is the true historical option for our people.Various electoral events which have taken place with the massive participation of the Salvadorian people and which have taken place in the presence of numerous international observers make it possible for us to assert the unquestionable legitimacy of our democratic processes.Our political process is based on our utmost desire to promote a dynamic process aiming at a free and fair society  one based on responsibility and on the active participation of all sectors of our society in the affairs of the State.Our basic task is that of defending and continuously improving the real bases and the ethical principles on which a democratic  participatory and pluralistic society is based. During the thirty-ninth session of this General Assembly  the President of the Republic of El Salvador proposed to the a rued groups in my country a peace offer whereby through dialog we would strive for national reconciliation in a context of democracy  justice and equity and within the framework of our political constitution  so as to create and provide for then a political space in which to integrate themselves into the great task of bringing democracy to our land.Consistent with the major objectives of peace and democratization  and based on the promise made in this forum  there was held in La Palma  Chalatenango  on 15 October 1984  the first meeting between representatives of the Government and the FHUi-FDR to initiate a process of dialog characterized by sincerity  honesty and good will in order to reach understanding  in no way based on a dialog of expediency for the purpose of improving positions.Our openness to constructive dialog continues to be our rule  a feeling which has not been shared by the extremist groups. This was shown during the second round of talks held in Ayagualo  Libertad Department  on 30 November 1984  in which they took advantage of the meeting to incite to violence and not to strengthen the road to peace as we had proposed. In general  in Ayagualo the extremist groups asked for the unconditional surrender of a legitimately constituted Government.Thus  despite the cloak of misinformation on the development of the dialog which was promoted at the international level by the leadership of the FMLN-POR  they placed a serious obstacle on the road to peace by trying to use the dialog for tactical purposes  in order to concentrate efforts toward the global development of their strategy of protracted popular war against our people and its institutions.Despite that  the Government thinks of dialog as something permanent and as a viable way toward a rational solution to the conflict it should thus be continued with sincerity and goodwill to attain peace.I thus reiterate in this forum my Government's readiness to continue its efforts to arrive at peace  including the commitment to do so through dialog.With regard to the situation in Central America  peace in the region will not be possible while rights for some States are unilaterally upheld and while an interventionist policy is promoted for the purpose of supporting armed illegal groups which seek to overthrow legitimately constituted Governments in order to impose a social system characterized by totalitarian domination by the State over the activities of its citizens.That is why  in various forums  we have on various occasions charged that the Sandinist Government of Nicaragua has turned the territory of its country into a sanctuary for Salvadoran subversion. There  armed groups of the extreme left rest  resupply and train and from there logistic support for the guerrillas is co-ordinated and sent to El Salvador.Nicaragua has thus become a destabilizing factor in Central America which blocks peace efforts  as was shown in June in Panama City when its representatives blocked the meeting convened within the framework of the Contadora initiative and refused to discuss a previously adopted agenda.To bring about objective conditions to strengthen the path to regional peace it is necessary that Governments  in particular that of Nicaragua  direct their efforts towards adopting reciprocal measures to reduce and eliminate elements of conflict and provocation. Also  they must try to set out in a direction which removes this question from the influences of the East-West conflict through verifiable measures to eliminate factors of intervention and permit our peoples to choose their own democratic paths to development.Because of those wishes  we respectfully appeal to the Government of Nicaragua to renew those negotiations in good faith and conclude pending negotiations on national reconciliation through processes of dialog with the political and military opposition leading to the establishment of democratic  pluralistic and representative systems  as well as on the limitation and reduction of armaments and military supplies and on verification and international control of agreements concluded.El Salvador reiterates the trust that it places in the peace initiative of the Contadora Group - Venezuela  Colombia  Panama and Mexico - recently reinforced by the Support Group made up of Brazil  Argentina  Peru and Uruguay  which is one more proof of the specific backing given by the Inter-American System to this process as well as by international bodies and the international community as a whole Contadora continues to be the most viable alternative for promoting a regional dialog based on the spirit of the original objectives of the Act on Peace and Co-operation In Central America  which brings together the positions and interests of our countries as the main subjects in such a way that it will make possible consensus and comprehensive agreement simultaneously in the region.El Salvador continues to be committed to the efforts of the Contadora Group and reaffirms its readiness in good faith to renew the dialog and negotiation on pending issues  it maintains its decision to attain permanent regional peace among Central American peoples so that we may find our own historical destiny in freedom  with a spirit of integration and solidarity  without interferences or external instruments of any type.The same desire for peace led us to negotiations with Honduras and thus in March 1980 we began negotiations establishing a program of work to approach the seven points which had been entrusted to the Mediator under the Mediation Convention signed in Washington in 1976 and in keeping with the resolutions- of the Thirteenth Consultative Meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS).The best result from those negotiations was the signing of the general peace treaty between Honduras and El Salvador in 1980  under whose terms we have advanced on most of the major points. We are now trying to solve the border issue as one of the main points of interest and national decision  in keeping with the letter and the spirit of that Treaty.We are making progress in carrying out the provisions and procedures established in that instrument. The Mixed Boundaries Commission is working in keeping with its mandate  within the time-limit set  towards a solution to the border problem  thus strengthening the process towards lasting peace and co-operation in the region.I urgently appeal for peace  freedom  justice  equity  solidarity  co-operation and the enhancement of our spiritual and moral values as the only and most desirable alternative  if we are to avoid confrontation and disenchantment.I wish to conclude this statement by renewing our appeal to the International community to state its views and show solidarity in a common front against all forms of terrorism which are a present-day scourge to mankind and which must be eliminated to strengthen human dignity and peaceful and harmonious coexistence among nations."
"113",6368,"SOM",40,1985,"I wish first of all to extend to Ambassador de Pinies  on behalf of the Somali Democratic Republic and on my own behalf  our sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at the fortieth session. It is certainly fitting that a diplomat with his great experience of united Nations affairs and one whose wisdom and learning are well known should guide the deliberations of this historic session.I also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to his predecessor  Ambassador Lusaka  who discharged his responsibilities as President at the thirty-ninth session.Before I go into the substance of my statement  permit me to express  on behalf of the people and Government of Somalia  our profound sympathy to the people and Government of Mexico on the tragic loss of life and destruction of property that has been suffered as a result of the earthquake.I feel privileged to be taking part in this session of the General Assembly  at which we are observing the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. This occasion must be cause for celebration because the world body  despite its failures and shortcomings  has established itself as an indisputable element of our complex and interdependent world. Whether we wish it or not  we live in an age when the only hope for a sane and peaceful future lies in implementing those purposes and principles which were formulated with prophetic vision by the framers of the Charter. While it cannot be said that their vision has yet been translated into reality  it is certainly true that a firm foundation has been laid for international co-operation in every field of human endeavor.In promoting the process of decolonization and the self-determination of peoples  the world Organization helped set in motion the creation of a community of sovereign States with universality as its goal. While this essential task is not fully completed  the far-reaching achievements of the United Nations in this area have strongly affirmed human dignity and the aspirations of millions of people throughout the world who have recovered their freedom and now enjoy the right to national identity and statehood.It is also a towering accomplishment that the world Organization's global overview of political  economic  social  technological and scientific problems is being used each day in practical and effective ways for the benefit not only of small or underdeveloped States but of mankind as a whole. When we consider the wide range of United Nations concerns - a range which includes improving the status of women  halting refugee flows and establishing a law of the sea - it must be acknowledged that the existence and the work of our Organization represent a significant and historic development in human affairs.If the United Nations often seems ineffective in resolving conflicts or bringing about just solutions to international problems  the fault lies in the failure of States to subordinate narrowly conceived national interests to the demands of world peace and security. The fault is not in the structure of the Organization. Regrettably  our celebration of the Organization's achievements must be accompanied by a realistic assessment of the world scene - a scene where the principle of collective security receives little attention; where colonial  imperialist and foreign domination are all too apparent; where the persistent denial of the right to self-determination ensures endemic tension and conflict; and where the violation of human rights takes a tragic toll in human misery. The world situation certainly holds out a challenge to all States to bring a renewed sense of responsibility to the discharge of their obligations as members of the world community of nations.A particularly heavy responsibility for world peace and security lies with the nuclear Powers. The hopes and aspirations of all the people of our planet areovershadowed by their dangerous global rivalry and by the steadily increasing capacity of their nuclear weapons for global disaster.My Government joins in the universal call to the super-Powers to seize every opportunity to strengthen peaceful coexistence and to reach agreement on the mutual reduction of nuclear stockpiles and on ending the development  testing and deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The world community rightly calls for investment in the quantifiable benefits of development rather than in death-dealing weapons which cannot bring security to anyone.A challenge of another order is presented to all Member States by the grave situation in South Africa. Over the years the United Nations has rightly kept before the conscience of the world the fact that apartheid is a crime against humanity. It has called on Member States to take action to end a system which is not only morally evil but also a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.Today we are seeing the inevitable and dangerous confrontation between the black majority - whose frustration and just anger can no longer be contained - and the militarily powerful racist minority  desperate to preserve its unjust privileges.The time has surely come for all States to respond to the voices of conscience that are being raised in every corner of the world and to co-operate in implementing the measures long promoted by the General Assembly for the establishment of a just society in South Africa. In the view of my Government  it is imperative  in this new and critical phase of the struggle inside and outside South Africa  that the cause of liberation be supported by intensified international pressure directed against the ruling white minority.We know from experience the duplicity of the Pretoria regime and the emptiness of its promises of reform. The salient facts today are that black leaders such as Nelson Mandela remain imprisoned  children and adults alike are daily victims of the murderous suppression of legitimate protest  and the regime has clearly indicated that it will not negotiate with the leaders of all groups to ensure the dismantling of apartheid.We believe that the only peaceful means of preventing the tragedy of a protracted and bloody racial conflict is the isolation of South Africa  particularly through the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions by the Security Council. We hope the Council will not shirk this grave responsibility  which involves regional and world peace and security.The necessity for imposing economic sanctions on South Africa is heightened by its continued illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council. We welcome the Council's condemnation of the latest attempt to impose a puppet government on the people of Namibia and of the repeated acts of military aggression directed by South Africa against the people and sovereign territories of Angola and Botswana. However  South Africa's murderous terrorism and its gross violations of international law call for stronger action. Effective measures are needed to bring about for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which remains the only legal basis for Namibia's independence. We hope that the political will can be found to end a situation which seriously undermines the credibility of the United Nations.The strong commitment of African countries to the struggle against apartheid and for Namibian independence demands that we give high priority also to measures to counteract South Africa's attempts to destabilize and undermine the economies of front-line and other African States. We call for the close co-operation of the international community in initiatives in this area.Unfortunately  southern Africa is not the only part of the continent threatened by outdated colonial policies and policies of military aggression. My Govern went is obliged to call the attention of the international community to the continued threat to peace and deterioration in stability in the Horn of Africa as a result of the acts of Military aggression repeatedly launched by Ethiopia against the Somali Democratic Republic. These unprovoked attacks take the form of terrorist bombardments of villages and border settlements  large-scale incursions across our borders and military occupation of our territory.The latest aggression of this kind took place only three weeks ago  when civilian centers in north-west and central Somalia were attacked by Ethiopian artillery and aircraft. This typically brutal and wanton assault caused numerous deaths and injuries and the destruction of the homes of innocent villagers.My Government calls for the strongest condemnation from the international community of Ethiopia's persistent violations of international law.Peace and stability in the Horn of Africa and in the strategically important Indian Ocean area are essential not only for the progress and welfare of the people of the region but also for world peace and security. However  as long as Ethiopia  the empire State of the region  continues to deny the right to self-determination to its colonized peoples in Western Somalia  Eritrea and Tigre  tension and conflict will remain endemic in the area. The presence in the Horn of Africa of a super-Power and its surrogate forces  which were called in to suppress legitimate liberation struggles  also raises the level of conflict and further destabilizes the region by drawing it into the arena of cold-war rivalry.Unparalleled suffering has been visited on large sections of the population in the Horn of Africa  not only through drought and famine but also through the fear and terror generated by political repression carried out by Ethiopia through forced population transfers and the effects of the inevitable military confrontations between national aspirations and colonial domination.These factors have all contributed to the massive and continuing flow of refugees into neighboring countries. In Somalia this flow has resulted in the largest political refugee population in Africa. For the past seven years the refugee presence has placed a crippling burden on my country's already fragile economy and constituted a heavy charge on the generosity of the international community  a permanent solution to the catastrophic refugee problem in the Horn of Africa depends to a large extent on the establishment of conditions which would encourage the refugees to return home without fear of political repression. Regrettably  a solution of this kind is still not in sight.A just and lasting solution of this long-standing problem can be achieved only if it takes into account the legitimate aspirations and inalienable rights of the oppressed and colonized peoples of the Horn of Africa. Unfortunately  our efforts have not met with success. Somalia is prepared to respond to the challenge of peace. We hope that Ethiopia  too  can be persuaded to choose that path.The Middle East question must still  unfortunately  be numbered among those which have remained unresolved in spite of 40 years of United Nations involvement and concern. Israel persists in its forceful occupation of Arab territory and its denial of the right of the Palestinian people to justice and self-determination  in total disregard of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law. An international consensus of long standing has established that the denial of Palestinian rights is at the heart of the Middle East conflict. The world community has witnessed with grave concern the escalation of violence in Lebanon  carried out with contempt for the accepted norms of international behavior and with savage ferocity  which has brought widespread death and destruction to Lebanese population centers. The recent attack by Israeli aircraft against civilian targets in Tunis and the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization is again typical of the arrogance which characterizes Israeli policies  we wish to state in this forum that Somalia condemns such actions.States which sow a harvest of injustice  aggression and contempt for the rights of others cannot expect to reap peace and tranquility. My Government is of the firm belief that there can be no peace in the Middle Bast without Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and without the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and the establishment of a State of their own. These realities of the Middle Bast situation must continue to be driven home in this Assembly and in the Security Council so that there may be a concerted international effort to bring about a just and comprehensive settlement of the conflict.My Government shares the concern of many States that world tension and instability continue to be heightened by a number of political problems  which are becoming unwelcome fixtures on the agenda of the General Assembly.In this context  my Government once again joins in the universal call for an end to the tragic conflict between Iraq and Iran  a conflict which serves no cause and can benefit neither country.We also view with serious concern the continued foreign occupation of Afghanistan and the military operations directed with cruel force against the courageous Afghan people. We highly commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a political settlement  including the return home of the Afghan refugees in safety and with honor  the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country  and restoration of Afghanistan's independence and non-aligned status.In the case of Kampuchea  where the long-suffering people have lost their freedom and have been denied the right to determine their own future  we hope that regional and international efforts will bring about conditions of liberty  justice and peace in Kampuchea and in the region of South-East Asia as a whole.One of my Government's deepest concerns is of course the critical economic situation in Africa. This situation is certainly grave enough to give rise to the call for a special session of the General Assembly which would consider how the world community might best help the continent overcome its crippling economic  social and ecological problems. The lives of millions of African people and the hopes of millions of others for a tolerable existence in the future are clearly threatened by the combination of natural and man-made disasters which affect a great many African countries. In my own country  the problems of cyclical drought  desertification and a catastrophic refugee influx have been superimposed on the weak economy and fragile infrastructure of underdevelopment. Those problems would have been crippling enough without the additional constraints imposed by adverse terms of trade and intolerable debt burdens caused by high interest rates.African States are fully committed to the Lagos Plan of Action  which calls on them to take primary responsibility for their development and to make the fullest use of regional co-operation in the solution of common problems. However  without a new and concerted resolve on the part of the international community to mobilize substantial medium-term and long-term  as well as emergency  assistance  our countries will continue to be like swimmers against the tide who cannot go forward in spite of exerting their strongest efforts.My Government hopes that the necessary international assistance will be forthcoming and that it will be focused on the areas of high priority identified this year by the twenty-first session of the Assembly of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Improving Africa's food situation  rehabilitating agricultural development across the continent and alleviating Africa's external debt burden are critical areas for immediate attention. It is also clear that support is needed at the same time for efforts to improve transport and communications.We believe that particular note needs to be taken of the extent to which the African economic crisis is an offshoot of the wider problem of an unbalanced and inequitable world economic system. Unfortunately  the countries of the North have yet to show that they share the developing world's vision of a new and more just economic order to the mutual benefit of both developed and developing countries. We regret that the struggle being aged in international organizations for better terms of trade  effective commodity agreements  reduced protectionism  debt relief and increased development assistance has been for the most part unsuccessful. The trend away from multilateralism and international co-operation in both the economic and political spheres is a disappointing setback to hopes for a world order based on justice  progress and peace.It can perhaps be hoped that the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations will encourage us to take a new and appreciative look at the experience of the past four decades and resolve to build with greater dedication and vigor on the foundations of international co-operation tLat have been so firmly laid.In this connection  I wish to pay a tribute to the dedicated work and effective diplomacy of Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar in the search for solutions to the many complex problems of our times.We must all pay the closest attention to the sober and constructive assessment of the world situation given in the Secretary-General's report to this Assembly. None of us can ignore the opening words of the report which point out that  while we face a world of almost infinite promise  it is also a world of potentially terminal danger. We need the opportunities provided by the United Nations to steer a course by which we can realize the hopes and aspirations enshrined in the Charter."
"114",6405,"STP",40,1985,"To your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  a worthy son of Africa  we wish to pay a tribute for the good example he gave us and for the commitment that marked the performance of his duties.May we be permitted also to express our special gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the dedication  determination and talent which have characterized his actions in leading our Organization and for the innovative spirit that has animated the initiatives that have come from his office. In particular  we should like to emphasize our appreciation of the innovative and courageous contribution made  in our opinion  by the analysis of the life of our Organization presented in his successive reports to the General Assembly.Emerging from the ashes of a catastrophe that assailed our planet and sowed the earth with desolation  the United Nations asserted itself as an instrument to catalyze the hope of all peoples for peace and progress. The celebration of its fortieth anniversary of necessity calls for an analysis of the results attained in the light of the objectives that we set ourselves when the United Nations was founded in San Francisco.This exercise would  however  prove of little consequence if we did not share the basic premise that the United Nations is what the will and collective action of its Members want it to be. As an expression of the collective will of States  the United Nations has  in their individual or collective action  the only instruments to guarantee the effective attainment of its objectives.Seen in this way - and that is our understanding - the exercise that we propose is transformed into a consideration of the magnitude and quality of the contributions each Member State has made over these 40 years of coexistence.When thus formulated  the question of responsibility for the continued use or threat of the use of force in international relations can be seen as attributable not to the inefficiency of the United Nations but to those States that violate Article 2  paragraph 4  of the Charter.If dejection and despair fill the hearts of those peoples who impotently witness  on many occasions  the inability of the United Nations to intervene to put an end to situations of conflict and aggression that threaten world peace and security  it is imperative to say that the actions called for in Chapter VII of the Charter are not being applied because of the lack of a common political will on the part of some Member States.If differences of interests and disputes between States often develop into situations of open conflict  we must recognize that the mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of disputes contained in Chapter VI  and recourse to the International Court of Justice  are often ignored by Member states.If the opulence of some stands in contrast with the poverty of the majority  this situation is not the result of any natural order of things  nor of the absence of a declared intention of the United Nations to conceive  adopt and promote actions aimed at a more just economic order.The truth of the matter resides in the stifling selfishness of a few who show their reluctance to challenge privileges of a bygone historical era by their opposition to changes in the structure and mechanisms of international economic relations that are intended to serve the development of all.Only through renewed commitment to the ideals of the United Nations shall we be able to restore its privileged and irreplaceable role in the continuing search for better forms of civilized coexistence among men.The presence of a delegation from the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe in this great assembly of sovereign nations is not only testimony to the fulfillment of the principle of universality of the United Nations  but also a tribute to its important role in promoting the rights of peoples to self-determination.It is important to mention here the significant contribution made by the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV) to the process of making our Organization truly universal.For the people of Sao Tome and Principe  this resolution placed on the agenda of the international community the long struggle of our people to affirm its own identity and to assume its national destiny.Conditioned by geographic isolation and oppressed by the repressive action of the colonial occupiers who deliberately limited us to a way of life isolated from the major liberating currents of our century  the struggle of the people of Sao Tome and Principe found in the liberating ideal of the United Nations and in the anti-colonial movement it generated a support that galvanized its struggle  inspired its strategy and strengthened its determination.The national sovereignty achieved on 12 July 1975  and our rightful subsequent integration into the international community as a State made it incumbent upon our State to adopt the ideals of the United Nations as its own and to pattern its external relations along the lines set forth in the Charter.The fact that the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe is a staunch supporter of the United Nations and that it contributes as far as it can to the attainment of its objectives is  therefore  merely a matter of consistency and responsibility.The breadth and degree of our involvement is consequently unique  and conditioned only by recognition of the limits on our own capacity for independent action.Our membership in the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is consistent with our recognition that the attainment of our national aspirations  and any significant participation in international life necessarily involve the blending of our own specific interests into a broad regional and international consensus that promote co-operation as an essential condition for the peace and progress of mankind.Thus we refrain from taking part in schemes to divide the world into spheres of influence sustained by political-military alliances  or in action which  starting with a definition of selfishly-delineated national interests  generate tension and conflict which threaten world peace and security.Thus we have chosen a policy of non-alignment as the most consistent way to defend our own commitment to universal peace  understanding and good neighborliness and active participation in the search for solutions to the problems of our time.But precisely because we understand that this commitment will be fully realized only in a world free of elements of conflict and war  we take an active part in the crusades on which our Organization has conferred legitimacy and which are understood to be consistent with its principles and compatible with the objectives it is pursuing.We include in this line of action our support for the struggle of peoples for self-determination and independence  for the elimination of racism  for respect for human rights  for disarmament  and for a ban on the threat or use of force in relations between States.Because our efforts to achieve national well-being and progress cure obstructed and are weakened by the existing world economic order  we join our voice to these of the countries of the underdeveloped areas which question the assumptions of the current order  and point out alternative paths which will bring justice to all  and will guarantee to all a just compensation for the effort expended in the creation of world wealth.The impetus given by the United Nations to the process of self-determination and independence of nations and peoples under colonial domination must be seen as one of the achievements of the greatest political significance in the history of contemporary international relations.While the United Nations can be proud of the progress made in Africa  Asia and Latin America  there remain situations which require a redoubled commitment  because in addition to denying rights established by our Organization  they appear in some cases as threats to international peace and security.In South Africa  the system of apartheid continues to be a permanent source of tension  a destabilizing factor and the chief obstacle to peace in the region.The arrogance with which the apartheid regime defies the collective will of the international community  systematically violates the territorial integrity of neighboring States  trains  finances and arms groups working against legitimate and lawfully constituted governments  calls for action which should be completely unambiguous and should lead to the abolition of the system.Forced into war  despite its desire for peace  the People's Republic of Angola is making enormous military and economic sacrifices to defend its territorial integrity  which is repeatedly violated by the racist army.Since the People's Republic of Angola has already demonstrated its readiness to negotiate  and its flexibility in the search for a solution compatible with its own sovereign rights  the justifications for the state of undeclared war imposed on it by South Africa are groundless  and one must question the good faith with which the Pretoria regime says that it is living up to its commitments.A very clear substantiation of our affirmation is the attempted sabotaging of Cabinda Gulf  and the most recent invasion and occupation of the southern part of Angolan territory.Counting on the destabilization of the region and the economic enfeeblement of the neighboring States as a condition for its own survival  the apartheid regime's opposing the climate of peaceful coexistence born of the N'Komati agreements and is attacking other front-line States.In Namibia  the installation of a so-called ""interim government"" represents a challenge to the desire already expressed by the international community to see an independent Namibia  and is one more obstacle to the process of implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978).Developments in the situation inside South Africa make it clear that the challenge to the apartheid system led by the African National Congress (ANC) and other democratic forces cannot be stifled by successive waves of repression legalized by states of emergency. They make it imperative for there to be a real dialog aimed at dismantling apartheid and introducing a system in which the individual rights and freedoms of each and every person are recognized and protected.In view of the intransigence of the Pretoria regime in refusing to admit the pressing nature of the changes required  and since all the doubts that have been dispelled of those who still entertain hopes as to its renouncing the basis of its racist policy  there is no other way out but firm and collective action by the international community and especially by those who maintain close relations with South Africa.While welcoming the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 571 (1985) and the measures decreed by various Member States  we believe that these must be followed up by more vigorous actions and  in particular  by the measures specified in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.Situations of conflict continue in other regions of the continent. An African problem  the question of Western Sahara merits special attention.within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  and in strict observance of the principles embodied in its charter  with a view to determining criteria which should be met by a just solution that will respect the dignity of all the peoples involved.Resolution AHG 104 adopted by the Heads of State and Government of the Pan-African organization constitutes  in our view  the most appropriate legal framework for a permanent resolution of the question. Opting for a dialog between the POLISARIO Front and the Kingdom of Morocco as a first step  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) calls above all for a peaceful outcome that will lead more surely to the establishment of a cease-fire  a condition deemed indispensable to the holding of a referendum on self-determination.The position taken by the recent Ministerial Meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly reflect an international consensus that confers upon the OAU's decision the legitimacy necessary for pursuing the efforts leading to its implementation.As part of the central region of the African continent  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe maintains with the neighboring States a dynamic relationship in which the good-neighborliness principle has pride of place. The steps taken by the OAU and  in this context  the efforts of the President of the People's Republic of the Congo to create a climate favorable to national reconciliation among the people of Chad deserve our full support. We believe that peace in Chad will be attained only by national reconciliation and by the recognition of the right of the people of Chad to decide for themselves  without foreign interference  on the ways and means that will best guarantee the defense of their national identity.In the Middle East  the wars that assail the region constitute a reason for continuing concern on the part of the international community  especially when their effects are extended to States which  traditionally peaceful  are attackedfor welcoming on their soil the legitimate representatives of a people whose right to an independent  sovereign homeland was usurped. It is our conviction that  regardless of the framework agreed upon  whether it be regional or international  a just and lasting solution of the conflict in the Middle Bast will not be achieved with the exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO)  the authentic and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.In the same region  another conflict is leading to the unjustified destruction of the national resources that are so necessary for the development of the peoples involved. Regretting that reason has given way to intransigence-  we join those who are appealing to Iran and Iraq to put an end to hostilities and to add their efforts to the common cause of the Arab peoples.We are watching with growing concern the rise in tension in Central America. By seeking a solution that will limit the conflict in Central America through an understanding that respects the legitimate rights and interests of each country involved  the initiative of the Contadora Group  because it is based on the principles enshrined in the Charter  seems to us to be a valid alternative for peace which should be backed and encouraged to continue.Though they are a source of reason and an encouragement to perseverance  the realization of the principles adopted by our Organization continues to be an elusive objective for certain peoples. The right of a people to true self-determination and independence should not be seen as depending upon its compatibility with regional or subregional convenience or with the nationalinterests of one State or another. As an absolute right of peoples  it supersedes the wheelings and dealings that seek to find justification for violation of that right in respect for the no-less legitimate right of States to non-interference in their internal affairs. Non-interference in the internal affairs of States has been a weapon brandished to avoid denunciation of the interruption of a process of decolonization by the use of force against a defenseless people.The struggle of the people of East Timor has already gone far beyond its borders and is seeking  abroad  to break through a wall of silence which cannot ' stifle the cry of emancipation uttered by the Maubere people. The recognition by the administering Power of the colonial fact and the armed resistance of the Maubere people  led by FRETILIN  are clear evidence that the Maubere people have not as yet benefited from the right to real self-determination. We commend the efforts that have been made by the Secretary-General to carry out the mandate given him by the General Assembly  and hope that talks between the parties  Portugal and Indonesia  will lead to a negotiated settlement of the essential question  namely  the self-determination of the people of East Timor.The continued division of the Korean peninsula and the state of tension that it entails constitute a constant concern for our country. We wish to praise and encourage the contacts between the two parts of Korea  and we continue to hold the view that only the peaceful reunification of Korea will guarantee peace in the region and will give satisfaction to the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people.There can be no doubt that negative effects of the present international economic order on the developing countries. Children  the innocent victims of this situation  cry out for special attention on the part of the international community. The decision by the United Nations Children's Fund to undertake a world-wide immunization program extending to the year 1990 is one contribution to the required action and it has the total support of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.Aggravated by the combination of the world economic crisis and natural calamities  the situation of many African countries  characterized by low levels of production  a drop in export earnings  constantly rising debt servicing requirements  food shortages and reduced capacity for investment in the productive sector  has merited special attention from the international community.It is timely to express here our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his work in calling the attention of the international community to the economic crisis prevailing in Africa and for the many actions that followed the adoption by the General Assembly  at its thirty-ninth session  of the Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa.Aware of the gravity of the situation  the Heads of State and Government of the OAU  recognizing the primary responsibility of the African countries in overcoming the crisis  identified  in accordance with the Lagos Plan of Action  some measures designed to revitalize African economies and called upon the international community  especially the institutions of the United Nations system  to provide assistance in many forms.As an island country in Africa on the list of the least developed countries  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has not been spared the adverse effects of the world economic crisis. The effects of this crisis  together with factors of an internal order  including climatic instability  have forced us to redefine our priorities and to devise a program of economic recovery and revitalization that relies on the maximum utilization of existing potential.Within this context  we recognize that an inflow of external aid appears at this stage to be an essential condition for success  so that  together with the United Nations Development Program  we will at the end of this year carry out the first phase of the round table in Brussels with the partners in the economicdevelopment of our country. continue to believe that the Members countries and other institutions in the United Nations system will be able to respond in a substantial and understanding manner to this initiative.Renewing our faith in and our total acceptance of the ideals and principles of the United Nations  we would express the belief that this fortieth session will go down in history as a milestone as we reaffirm our confidence in and collective dedication to the role that the United Nations is called upon to play in the search for a better world."
"115",6437,"SUR",40,1985,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Ambassador de Pinies cm his election to preside over the General Assembly at its fortieth session. At the same time  I wish him much strength  for the tense and dangerous world situation requires a serious discussion at this forum. I also pay tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  for the skill and dedication with which he guided the proceedings of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I take this opportunity to reaffirm to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar the appreciation and support of the Government of Suriname for his contribution to international peace  security and co-operation.We express our sincere sympathy to the Government and the people of Mexico  which suffered so much during the recent earthquakes. We support the resolution which calls upon the international community to render generous assistance to alleviate the suffering of that people.When the United Nations was founded  in the aftermath of the Second World War  its main objectives were international peace and co-operation and the preservation of the human species. There was a belief  a willingness and a common spirit throughout the world to join the march of mankind towards achieving the objectives to which we had solemnly committed ourselves.In the past 40 years the united Nations has made invaluable contributions to the process of decolonization by actively opposing neo-colonialism and racism and by endeavoring to establish a new international economic order. The specialized agencies of this world body have made great contributions to the improvement of humanity and to the alleviation of global problems. But the United Nations has also known failures and shortcomings which require that certain measures be taken  measures to develop this world Organization further and strengthen multilateralism  we therefore cannot go along with those who use the shortcomings of the United Nations as a pretext to weaken multilateralism and to opt for bilateral relations.We welcome the decision to commemorate this fortieth anniversary  which will provide us with the opportunity to elaborate further on the role of the united Nations.The current world economic crisis  which originated in some of the major industrialized countries  has now become truly global in nature and scope. The seriousness and the acute character of the crisis which we are experiencing  and of which the third-world countries are the worst victims  require the re-evaluation of the role of this multilateral Organization in international economic relations and in the fostering of solutions to these problems.When certain financial and other institutions were established  problems were not considered comprehensively  nor was the changing world political situation taken into account. At that time the majority of today's developing countries were not independent. The mechanisms of these institutions and the economic system of which they were a reflection were actually designed to protect the interests of the developed countries. The contradictions inherent in this system became apparent in the sixties  shortly.after many third-world countries had gained their independence. This economic system has proved to be unsuitable not only for the developmental needs of the third-world countries  but for the peoples of the countries which initiated it as well.The current economic order has left the developing countries with continuously declining growth rates. Terms of trade have deteriorated and have further been affected by exchange-rate fluctuations  while the prices of raw materials are continually falling. High interest rates  protectionist measures and rising debt burdens have heavily undermined the economies of the developing countries. This poses a serious threat to their economic  social and political stability  and hence to international peace and security.There seems to be an unwillingness among certain developed countries to engage in serious and meaningful negotiations to bring an end to the inequalities and injustices in international relations. My Government is of the opinion that the developed countries have to demonstrate their political will by considering the world economic problems in their totality. The current situation has abundantly demonstrated that the interests of the developed countries and those of the developing countries can no longer be treated separately.The interdependent nature of the international situation  the increasing interrelationship of problems and the interconnection of their solutions must bean incentive and reason for dialog and co-operation between the developing and the developed world. Global economic growth can be achieved and sustained by the co-operation of developed and developing countries in a partnership that is mutually beneficial.The North-south dialog can yield positive results only if South-South co-operation is strengthened. Suriname will actively promote this form of co-operation  which  contrary to North-South relations  is not affected by the burden of inequalities inherited from colonialism and neo-colonialism. The relations between the third-world countries can be more genuine and sound and mutually beneficial  and can allow us to enjoy profits and benefits which were previously drained from our societies.Peace and development are interrelated. Hence  the international community cannot be assured of durable peace so long as the economic disparities between nations keep widening. Political instability  resulting from armed conflicts  intervention and interference and the dangerous arms race  is hampering global development and the establishment of a viable economic order  since political freedom and economic progress are inseparable.Given the present international situation  it is the inalienable right and the desire of the peoples of the third-world countries to liberate themselves from economic dependence and to build a strong national economy for their own interest and prosperity. Yet this uncontestable truth is often denied and is sometimes even met by economic  political or military aggression.We condemn the use of economic measures by some developed countries as a means of exerting political coercion  and we urge Member states to develop effective ways to prevent embargoes  sanctions or any other coercive actions incompatible with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We express the hope that this organization will take effective measures to put ah end to such practices  as they reflect the objectionable attitude of the right of the strongest.Suriname is deeply concerned about the aggression and repression carried out against peoples struggling for their national liberation. Our position is based on the fundamental principles of respect for the national sovereignty of States  the right of self-determination  the principles of non-intervention and non-interference  the settlement.of disputes by peaceful means  and the establishment of relations based on mutual benefit. These are founding principles of the Non-Aligned Movement  of which my country is an active member. There is an immense task to be carried out by that Movement as it continues the work begun by its leaders  such as Jawaharlal Nehru  Soekarno  Gamal Abdel Nasser  Julius Nyerere  Fidel Castro  Josip Bros Tito and Indira Gandhi. The Non-Aligned Movement  which expresses the interests of the third-world countries  has an enormous task to perform in the creation of a new international economic order.Suriname deplores the fact that on this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations we still cannot welcome to our midst a free South Africa liberated from apartheid. That despicable regime  which reminds us of the most savage and cruel period of colonial times  stands out in sharp contrast to the civilized world. The apartheid regime is now using new  refined forms of oppression to thwart the struggle for freedom of the vast majority of the people  while polarization in the country is growing. But nothing - not even the countless deaths among the black people - can stunt their growing awareness or quell their desire for freedom. The apartheid regime will not last! it is doomed to be buried in the dark pages of the history of mankind.Our Government is of the opinion that  since the United Nations has qualified apartheid as a crime against humanity and since Pretoria neither accepts nor allows any form of dialog on a basis of equality  the people of South Africa have the legitimate right to carry out armed insurrection against that form of modern slavery. Suriname condemns the complicity of a number of western countries that maintain economic  commercial and military relations with the racist regime  thus violating United Nations resolutions. By doing so they artificially sustain a regime which is incapable of sustaining itself by its own force.Given the policies of the apartheid regime  slow and gradual change in South Africa can no longer be accepted as an alternative  for the toll the oppressed people of South Africa would have to pay would be unacceptably high. Moreover  the world community cannot tolerate the genocide of the black people  which seems to be the only option for the racist regime.The regime of South Africa does not confine its deplorable actions to its own territory  but continues illegally to occupy Namibia through a modern form of colonialism and to impose there the inhumane rules of apartheid. My Government calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all South African troops from Namibia and for an end to all the influence being exercised there. We demand the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  without qualification  amendment or the introduction of extraneous and irrelevant issues of linkage  parallelism or reciprocity. Suriname supports the struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) for an independent and free Namibia  as we stressed at the special ministerial conference on Namibia held by the Co-ordinating Bureau of the non-aligned countries in New Delhi in April this year.We also condemn all acts of aggression committed by South Africa against neighboring countries and give our full support to the struggle of the front-line and other neighboring States to defend their national sovereignty.The African continent  with its enormous natural and human resources  remains one of the least developed parts of the world. Because of the vulnerable economic situation of the African countries  it has been impossible to do anything to counter the worsening climatic conditions which plague those countries and threaten the very survival of their people.The tragedy we have been witnessing for decades in the Middle East has not permitted a single ray of hope throughout all those years. The deteriorating situation since the invasion of Lebanon is a matter of deep concern to my Government. We condemn Israel for its aggressive and expansionist policy towards neighboring countries  its indiscriminate and hasty resort to violence  its disregard of United Nations resolutions and its total lack of will to co-operate in the search for a lasting settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. We also condemn Israel for its recent brutal military attack on Tunisia  in flagrant violation of that country's sovereignty and territorial integrity  in a vain attempt to destroy the heroic Palestinian resistance. We affirm our support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people struggling for national liberation. It is the opinion of my Government that the Palestinian question cannot be solved without the participation of the PLO.An unfortunate conflict between Iran and Iraq has escalated into a bloody and tragic war  threatening peace and security in that region. We appeal to those brother nations to cease their hostilities and engage in meaningful dialog  in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and of the Non-Aligned Movement  and to reach a political settlement of the war.With respect to the situation on the Korean peninsula  my Government supports the efforts of both parties to bring about reconciliation between the north and the south. The peaceful reunification of the Korean people would be an invaluable contribution to their future and prosperity.We are deeply concerned about the tense situation in Central America. The people of that region have the right to determine their own future without any external political  economic or military interference. We therefore condemn the economic embargo against Nicaragua  the officially approved military aid to counter-revolutionary groups  and the so-called humanitarian aid that is  paradoxically  given to inhumane forces.We categorically reject all plans for or threats of a military invasion of Nicaragua or El Salvador as a flagrant violation of the basic principles of the Charter of the united Nations. We fully support the untiring efforts of the Contadora group to achieve a peaceful solution to this conflict. The Contadora countries are fulfilling an important task in this hemisphere and are proving that the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean are able to solve their own problems by peaceful means without external interference.The tense and dangerous situation  which can easily escalate into a total Central American war  has awakened the Latin American consciousness that a peaceful solution to the Central American conflict is possible. This has resulted in growing support for the efforts of the Contadora group.In the Caribbean  with its numerous small countries seeking viable development strategies  the existing socio-economic and political conditions are of great concern. Only the consolidation of Caribbean unity  based on the genuine interests of the people concerned  can solve the deep and prolonged crisis created by structural factors.We are of the opinion that our region is basically confronted with problems which are caused by socio-economic stagnation. We therefore stress that solutions have to be found in the socio-economic field. We have noticed and we deplore the tendency to interpret these problems in the context of East-West tensions which  inter alia  has resulted in the military invasion of Grenada. We consider this tendency to be a policy to distract attention from the real causes.We reiterate our call that the Caribbean and Central American region should be declared a zone of peace  which will lay the basis for stability and economic development in this region.In the southern zone the repeated initiatives of the Government of Argentina with regard to the Malvinas Islands have not yet resulted in the reopening ofnegotiations  we wish to reaffirm our support for Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and we support all peaceful initiatives designed to settle the dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.My delegation considers the successful conclusion in 1982 of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea as a historical achievement. This convention established a new legal order for the rational use of the seas and oceans as an instrument for peace  development and international co-operation  which will contribute to the achievement of a new international economic order.The resources of the international area of the sea-bed can only be explored and exploited lawfully within the scope and under the international regime of the convention. We are of the opinion that no unilateral action by any State or group of states  through a separate mini-convention or parallel regime  will have any validity.In the past decade the world community has been confronted with the question of refugees  which is a consequence of internal political developments or armed conflicts between States.It is the responsibility of the international community and the parties concerned to find primarily political solutions to these problems.We reiterate our support for the drafting of an international convention prohibiting the recruitment  financing  training and use of mercenaries. We would request Member states to co-operate in order to finalize the work of the United Nations in this respect.The fact that Suriname only recently gained independence had several disadvantages for the country. At the same time  it provided us with the opportunity to learn from the sad and painful post-colonial experiences of so many countries in Asia  Africa and our own region  which became independent since the 1940s. Their experience taught us that the process of decolonization did not put an end to colonialism  but revived it in the disguised form of neo-colonialism.The high toll that the peoples of the third world have paid during the past decades has taught us another important lesson  namely  that after a colony gains formal political independence  it sooner or later becomes necessary to establish genuine independence. The 25 February 1980 was the beginning of this real independence of Suriname  when State power was seized by young patriots and new prospects were opened up of building a strong national economy for the benefit of the people. Several obstacles had to be faced when problems arose as a reaction to this policy. On the national scene we have been able to safeguard the unity of the people  to establish stability and to defend our sovereignty in the political and economic field.In this respect  we welcome the solidarity of the Non-Aligned Movement with the ongoing process in Suriname  expressed at the Seventh Meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs  recently held in Luanda  Angola  as follows:""The Ministers reiterated their support for and solidarity with the people and the Government of the Republic of Suriname in their efforts aimed at preserving the independence and sovereignty of Suriname. They expressed their deep concern at measures taken and continuing attempts of certain Governments to exert pressures  which have an adverse effect on the political  economic and social development of Suriname and express the hope that the Governments concerned will engage in a frank  fair and meaningful dialog  without coercion or any other form of interference  in order to arrive at a solution on the basis of mutual respect and in the interest and well-being of the people of Suriname.""Since the people are the architects of their own future  we stand resolute in our conviction to continue the democratization process that has already begun. This will enable our people fully to participate and exercise political power in our society.In the process of authentic democratization  based on the reality in Suriname and the aspirations of our people  a National Assembly has been installed in which representatives of trade unions  national entrepeneurs and the revolutionary movement are participating.A national dialog has been started in an effort to incorporate all national forces in our endeavors to realize a just and equitable society for the entire people.At the same time  an independent national institute for human rights was established in accordance with recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. This institute  which is already functioning  has established close relations with relevant international organizations.Today  Suriname forms an integral part of both the Caribbean and Latin America and we actively encourage the integration of the region. He believe that the integration of our region is an indispensable condition for the solution of the fundamental problems confronting us.The astronomical Latin American debt forces our countries into concerted action to find solutions for this grave economic problem  which has already developed into a major political issue in the region. The debt cannot be repaid without bringing about the misery of the peoples of this continent. Therefore  repayment must be related to the export earnings and the repayment capacity of the debtor countries. The debt problem once more proves the need for a concerted effort by the countries in the region to find solutions to common problems. Suriname will actively support every initiative which consolidates the integration and unity of the region.Suriname has welcomed the decision of the General Assembly to declare 1986 the International Year of Peace. We consider this decision primarily as timely support for the growing desire of the peoples of the world to put an end to the use of force in relations among States. At the same time  any indication of a continued arms race causes great anxiety.We oppose the continued production of nuclear arms  the creation of nuclear arms systems  the tendency for monopolization of nuclear technology and the ""star wars"" program. The arms race brings economic development to a halt  creates unstable political situations and poses a threat to peace and security and to the future of humanity. We urge that nuclear technology should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and for the development of mankind  and we advocate a complete ban on nuclear arms.Many valuable resources  including huge sums of money  manpower and the intellect of many of the most talented and gifted men  which are now being wasted  should be utilized for the benefit of mankind.It is therefore the sincere hope of my Government that  in the coming year which will be devoted to the cause of peace  the Member states of this Organization will find solutions which will guarantee a future for humanity. We urge the countries concerned to negotiate seriously the urgent problem of arms limitation.My country gained its independence in November 1975. we became a Member of the United Nations in the same year. Despite the shortcomings of this Organization  its principles provide us with the most effective instruments to regulate international relations in this divided contemporary world. On this tenth anniversary of the membership of the Republic of Suriname  we therefore renew our commitment to the principles of the united Nations."
"116",6531,"SWE",40,1985,"It gives me great pleasure to join those who have spoken before me. Sir  in congratulating you on your assumption of the high office of President of the Assembly. Your skills and ability  your experience and leadership  are well known. Consequently we could not have found a person better suited than you to guide our deliberations at this important juncture. Your election is a tribute to your personal qualities and to your country. We are confident that your guidance will make this session of the General Assembly fruitful and productive.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Ambassador Lusaka of Zambia  who served with great distinction as President of the Assembly during its thirty-ninth session. Like those who have spoken before me  I wish to express my admiration for the way in which Ambassador Lusaka carried out his task. His presidency has earned both him and his country great honor.On behalf of the Swedish Government  I wish to express to the Government and people of Mexico our deepest sympathy for the great human suffering and extensive material damage the recent earthquake in Mexico cost them. The people of Sweden were deeply distressed to learn about that almost incomprehensible natural disaster. I wish to assure the representative of Mexico of my Government's readiness to contribute in assisting Mexico in its emergency and in its heavy task of reconstruction.During this session of the General Assembly the United Nations will celebrate its fortieth anniversary. This gives me a welcome opportunity to confirm that Sweden's membership of the United Nations and the obligations it implies remain a cornerstone of Swedish foreign policy.One of the most important changes during the past 40 years is that the United Nations has become almost universal. At a time of ever-growing interdependence it is more important than over to safeguard this valuable asset. More than a hundred new independent States have been admitted as members. Largely owing to the United Nations  it was possible to accelerate the process of decolonization.The basic task of the united Nations of maintaining international peace and security is more important than ever in the age of nuclear weapons. In this area  the Organization is facing a number of difficulties. The Secretary-General has stimulated a necessary international discussion on the possibilities of strengthening the role of the United Nations in this respect.Under the Charter  a special responsibility has been placed upon the permanent members of the Security Council. It depends mainly on them whether or not the United Nations can be used as an effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the promotion of a peaceful development in the world.The arms race continues unimpeded. As emphasized in the United Nations study on security concepts  no State can any longer build its security exclusively on its own military strength. Even the nuclear-weapon States are ultimately dependent for their security on decisions taken in capitals far from their own territories.Issues of war and peace and international development cannot be left exclusively to the great Powers. This has been underlined in the so-called Five-Continent Peace Initiative  signed by Heads of State and Government from six countries  including Sweden. In this initiative it is emphasized that non-nuclear-weapon States also have the right to make their voices heard with regard to nuclear weapons.Today  nuclear weapons are a threat to the survival of mankind. More and more States are beginning to discuss nuclear weapons also in terms of international law. The Charter of the United Nations prohibits the threat or use of force. The use of force in self-defense that is recognized in the Charter must be proportionate to the force used by the attacker. Furthermore  it should be noted that existing international law relating to armed conflict contains some general principles which outlaw certain methods of warfare. Relevant principles in this context are inter alia the principle of distinction between military and civilian objects  the ban on methods and means that cause unnecessary suffering and the principle of proportionality. The latter principle prohibits attacks which may be expected to cause civilian losses that would be excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated. Principles of international law place a heavy responsibility on any Government considering the use of nuclear weapons. The use of nuclear weapons in contravention of the principles to which I have just referred will be in conflict with international law.Today  interest is focused on the bilateral negotiations in Geneva and the approaching summit meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. But at the same time as these negotiations are in progress  the arsenals are growing. The proposal for a nuclear-weapon freeze remains valid. A freeze could be a first step towards reductions in  and the elimination of  nuclear weapons.However  the bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States cannot diminish the importance of the multilateral work done here in the United Nations  at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and in other forums. For Europe  the process initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the ongoing Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security-Building Measures offer important opportunities of strengthening co-operation and detente. As the Stockholm Conference now approaches its final stages  it is essential that the negotiations enter into a more concrete phase as soon as possible.The arms race knows no boundaries and is reaching to the oceans and out into space. Outer space is the common heritage of mankind. Peaceful space activities are today of great importance to all States for purposes of communication  for earth resources surveys and for weather observation. As far as security policy is concerned  satellites have important stabilizing functions  such as early warning and the verification of disarmament agreements.The issue of preventing an arms race in outer space has attracted much attention recently. The Swedish Government believes that security cannot be achieved through technical solutions  as  for example  new military systems which can be introduced in outer space. They cannot solve the problem of reliance on nuclear deterrence  which is fundamentally a political problem. Only negotiated political solutions can be realistic. Sweden has also noted with concern the development of anti-satellite systems  which contribute to an increased risk of an arms race in outer space and to destabilizing development in a strategic area.Another serious development in weapons technology is the obvious risk of a growing concentration on such weapons as sea and air-launched cruise missiles. The Swedish Government wishes in particular to emphasize the importance of reaching agreement on a ban on long-range cruise missiles.The naval arms race has brought the military forces of the great Powers  including their nuclear weapons  to all continents. The United Nations study on the naval arms race  which has now been completed  demonstrates the importance of disarmament and confidence-building measures in this area as well as of measures to strengthen the rules of international law on naval warfare.It ought to be of common interest to all States to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The best way of achieving this is to strengthen the international set of rules that has been drawn up through the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Against this background  we regret that some nuclear-weaponStates are not even prepared to negotiate on a complete nuclear-weapon test ban. This measure  above all others  would contribute to the prevention of a threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons.There is also a risk that other types of weapons of mass destruction will spread to more states. The plans for the manufacture of binary chemical weaponsexisting ban on the use of chemical weapons. The Swedish Government hopes that the ongoing negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva will lead to a comprehensive ban on such weapons.The relationship between disarmament and development has been highlighted in several international studies. A national study has been carried out in Sweden pursuant to a recommendation of the United Nations. Sweden will take an active part in the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development that the General Assembly has decided to convene.The struggle of the great Powers for power and influence tends often to aggravate local and regional crises. A growing part of the transfer of resources to the developing countries is given in the form of military support. The international arms transfers are increasing in magnitude.The situation in southern Africa today constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. In its defense of the abhorrent system of apartheid  the white minority regime in South Africa has demonstrated that it is prepared to use brutal force against the majority of the population as well as against neighboring countries.are a cause of grave concern.For decades we have appealed in vain to the white minority regime to abolish apartheid. Time is now running out. A peaceful solution should  however  still be possible. Therefore  decisive reforms roust be brought about without delay in order to transform South Africa into a democracy with equal rights for all. Only in this way can enormous suffering for all  including the white minority  be avoided.The state of emergency in South Africa should be lifted immediately  the political prisoners released and a dialog initiated with the authentic leaders of the majority of the population.Mandatory sanctions decided upon by the united Nations Security Council are  in the opinion of the Swedish Government  the most effective means of pressure at our disposal. They also represent a peaceful means  supported by prominent leaders of the black majority  its liberation movements and Africa as a whole.Recently international pressure on South Africa has grown significantly. A further increase in this pressure is necessary. In the view of my Government the the Security Council resolution of 26 July this year was a step in the right direction. In that resolution member states were recommended to take certain measures against South Africa  such as the suspension of all new investments there.These measures should now be made mandatory through a decision of the Security Council in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter. Only if applied by all States can they become truly effective. If South Africa does not fundamentally change its policy  the sanctions should be extended to cover other important areas  such as the economic field as a whole and communications.Economic sanctions against South Africa are particularly appropriate as a contribution to the peaceful abolition of the policy of apartheid  as apartheid is also a system of economic repression. The apartheid policy facilitates the exploitation of the black population  which in turn is a prerequisite for the very high standard of living of the white minority compared with that of the black majority. The short-term economic benefits of the apartheid policy are an important explanation as to why the white minority adheres so strongly to that inhuman system.The Swedish Government will continue its efforts to help increase pressure on South Africa. In addition to the measures already taken in Sweden this year -among them the strengthening of the ban on new investments introduced in 1979 - we shall take certain unilateral measures over and above the measures recommended by the Security Council. In particular  I should like to mention a recommendation to Swedish companies to seek markets and suppliers outside South Africa  as well as a ban on all imports into Sweden of agricultural products from South Africa.Together with the other Nordic countries  we are working on an extension and strengthening of our 197S joint Nordic program of action against South Africa. A new  revised program will be presented at a meeting of the Nordic Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Oslo next month.Namibia is a country under foreign occupation. Again South Africa is trying to force its political solutions on the Namibian people. This is a flagrant violation of the plan for independence and free elections in Namibia which was adopted by the Security Council as long ago as in 1978. Questions that fall outside the United Nations plan must not be used as a pretext to prevent its implementation.However  South Africa shows no sign that it is willing to abandon its delaying tactics. The Security Council should  therefore  as envisaged in its resolution of June this year and without further delay  take effective action against South Africa  including mandatory sanctions  with a view to ensuring the implementation of the United Nations plan.Sweden is increasing its assistance to the liberation movements  the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  to the refugees and to the victims and opponents of the apartheid system. Some of this assistance is channeled through various united Nations agencies. Together with our development assistance to the front-line States and to the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  Swedish assistance to southern Africa for the current fiscal year amounts to more than 1.7 billion Swedish Krona. This represents one third of our total bilateral assistance to developing countries.The situation in the Middle East remains grave. Different initiatives taken in the region indicate  however  a strong desire for peace. The efforts to advance the peace process must receive support.A lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East requires that the parties meet in direct negotiations. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) must have the right to participate on an equal basis in such negotiations. An international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations might be a way of bringing the parties together and could serve as a framework for direct negotiations.The right of Israel and other States in the area to exist must be recognized. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) should be the basis for a negotiated settlement. In our opinion  these resolutions mean that Israel should withdraw from the territories occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace being ensured within secure and recognized boundaries. For a settlement to be lasting  it is also required that the Palestinian people achieve self-determination. They have  if they so wish  the right to for a state of their own on the West Bank and in the Gaza strip.The deep crisis in Lebanon remains. Apart from the many Lebanese victims of this tragic conflict  aggravated by the Israeli invasion  the fighting has caused suffering to the Palestinian refugees. Those refugees find themselves in an increasingly vulnerable situation. The main responsibility for finding a solution to the country's crisis rests with the Lebanese parties themselves. At the same timer external powers must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.The war between Iran and Iraq has now lasted for five years. Widespread suffering and casualties on both sides have resulted. Civilian population centers have been bombed and chemical weapons used  in violation of the rules of international law.It is the fervent hope of the Swedish Government that it will be possible to bring the conflict to an early end by peaceful means. We fully support the United Nations efforts in this respect. In particular  the elements of a peaceful solution presented to the parties by the Secretary-General should be recalled. The Swedish Prime Minister  Mr. Olof Palme  Special Representative of the Secretary-General  is closely following the development of the conflict and remains in contact with the parties concerned in order to promote such a solution.The continuing armed intervention in Afghanistan by the Soviet Union constitutes a violation of the fundamental rules of international law and must be unequivocally condemned. The Swedish Government supports the efforts of the United Nations to find a negotiated solution to the conflict. The main element in a peaceful solution must be the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the possibility for the people of Afghanistan to determine their own form of government and their own future. It is important that a report to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has drawn attention to the violations of human rights in Afghanistan and the suffering of its people. For many years Kampuchea has been the victim of foreign intervention and convulsive internal strife. We recall the terrible suffering that the Kampuchean people went through under Pol Pot's regime. Human rights must be respected. It is our firm opinion that the Vietnamese occupation must end without delay  since it represents a violation of fundamental principles of international law. It is necessary to pursue the efforts to create conditions for the Kampuchean people again to determine their own future without external intervention and internal repression. We urge the parties concerned to spare no effort to achieve a negotiated settlement which ensures such a future.The conflicts in Central America have their origin in economic and social injustices. They can only be solved by negotiations. The Contadora group  strengthened by the support group formed by four countries  must be given the opportunity of completing its work for peace in a climate which is not marked by East-West tensions and increased militarization. The international community must reject measures in violation of international law to overthrow a legitimate Government  such as boycott actions and support of armed groups. All States must pursue a policy which reduces the level of military armaments in the area and promotes negotiations. The peace talks in El Salvador should be resumed  as well as the bilateral talks between the United States ant! Nicaragua. The United States has a great and undeniable influence in this part of the world  and thus an important role to play to promote a peaceful development.We note with satisfaction that the two Korean States have now begun to take cautious steps towards increased mutual contacts. These initiatives represent a possibility of allowing the armistice of the past thirty years to be followed by real peace in the Korean peninsula.The protection of human rights is the concern of the international community as a whole  and not only an internal matter for individual countries. Violations of human rights in a country often have international repercussions in the form of increased tension and risks of international conflict. Equally  it is apparent that tension between States often leads be increased oppression within States.For a long time Sweden has been involved in the struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We actively participate in the further development of international norms in this field. The two Human Rights Covenants were adopted as early as 1966. Sweden has ratified these Covenants and has furthermore acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. My country has thereby accepted international supervision of the implementation of that Covenant. We urge all States to adhere to these fundamental treaties. We also urge them to accept the competence of the supervisory bodies as regards individual complaints as well.The Swedish Government welcomes the fact that the international norms and principles in the area of human rights have been further supplemented by the Convention against torture which was unanimously adopted by this Assembly last year. Sweden intends to ratify that Convention before the end of the year.The question of the abolition of the death penalty should remain on the international agenda. These efforts must not be delayed.Unfortunately  there is a gap between theory and practice as regards human rights. Violations of human rights should be pointed out wherever they occur.Sweden was pleased to support the adoption of the forward-looking strategies at the United Nations women's Conference in Nairobi. The consensus that was reached conveys optimism for the future and constitutes a firm ground for all to build on in order to promote equality between women and men.The imbalances in the world economy represent a continued threat to international economic development. Determined and mutually supportive actions by all countries are essential. The struggle against protectionism is of the utmost importance. Both industrialized and developing countries must strive to expand and strengthen free trade. A new round of multilateral trade negotiations  carefully prepared  would constitute an important step in such a process. The special trade problems of the developing countries must be one area of priority.Increased access to the markets of the industrialized countries is a prerequisite for the developing countries if they are to achieve a long-term solution to their serious debt problems  which are a threat not least to the development of the poorest countries.Studies by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) clearly show the great need for increased development assistance to those countries. Furthermore  these studies demonstrate that the major part of all development assistance has given positive results. Donor countries must now increase their assistance  especially through the multilateral development agencies. Above all the International Development Association (IDA) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  with their knowledge  size and co-ordinating capacity  have an important role to play in solving today's development crisis. Without a determined and consistent financial strategy  based on co-operation between donors  recipients and financial institutions  we shall not be able to achieve sustainable progress  above all not in the poorest countries.This applies particularly to Africa. The international community has already made a considerable effort to relieve this crisis-stricken continent. However  much remains to be done. Our aim must be to link disaster relief to long-term efforts. Productive agricultural capacity must be restored and the process of desertification and deforestation reversed.The international program of action for the most vulnerable group of countries  those least developed  will soon be reviewed in Geneva. This will be a suitable occasion for donor countries and the least-developed countries to approach the problems jointly in a practical way.The refugee situation in the world continues to be of the utmost concern. More and more people are forced to leave their countries. In addition to well-grounded fears of persecution  this is increasingly the result of war  internal conflicts and natural disasters. The need for immediate relief .is growing  while at the same time greater resources are required in order to achieve lasting solutions. In the poorest countries assistance to refugees should be combined with long-term development assistance  taking into account the needs of the local population in areas with many refugees. The Swedish Government greatly appreciates the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and will continue to support this important humanitarian work.During the past decade  the United Nations and the United Nations system have become an increasingly important instrument for joint efforts by Member States to cope with large-scale environmental problems such as soil erosion  air pollution and the handling of hazardous waste. International environmental co-operation requires that  through the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)  environmental aspects be included in large areas of the activities of the United Nations and of most of the specialized agencies.Sweden is of the view that one of the really great challenges for the United Nations is to develop into an effective instrument for the co-operation of the Member States in counteracting the disastrous destruction of the environment which affects all mankind.The narcotic drug situation in the world is alarming. Illegal production of narcotic drugs is increasing  illicit trafficking is becoming better organized and more difficult to combat. The international struggle against illegal drugs must be intensified. Sweden welcomes the various initiatives taken to achieve better co-ordination of united Nations efforts. We also welcome the Secretary-General's proposal for a world conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking. It is our hope that the proposal will be adopted and that the conference will lead to global support for a concrete program of action.The Swedish Government is deeply concerned that an organization of such importance as the United Nations should have serious financial problems. The principle of collective financial problems responsibility flows from Article 17 of the Charter. It should be obvious to all Member States that they must meet their obligations. The largest part of the financial deficit  which at the end of 1984 was estimated at $US 360 million  pertains to contributions withheld from important peace-keeping operations. In practice  this means that the deficit is largely financed by the troop-contributing countries.Unilateral national decisions not to pay the contribution assessed by the United Nations  for whatever reason they are made  undermine morale and the fundamental principle of collective responsibility for the financing of the United Nations. Developments in this respect are alarming and we appeal especially to the Soviet Union and the United States to consider their responsibility. The work of the United Nations must have a financially sound foundation which enables the Organization to carry out its tasks in an effective and rational way.The United Nations is a unique forum in which the States of the world can seek solutions to their ever-more-pressing problems. In every field interdependence grows stronger. Only through joint efforts can we create the necessary conditions for lasting peace and security  respect for human rights  economic and social progress and a genuine commitment to the fulfillment of our responsibility towards our environment and the finite resources of our planet.This anniversary calls for reflection. We must safeguard our indispensable Organization. We must also provide it with the opportunities and resources it needs to fulfill the functions vital to the future of humanity."
"117",6569,"SWZ",40,1985,"On behalf of my delegation. Her Majesty's Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland  I should like to convey our profound gratitude and sincerest congratulations to Mr. Jaime de Pinies on his well-deserved election to the presidency of this historic fortieth session of the General Assembly. My delegation has no doubt whatsoever that his wisdom and rich diplomatic experience will help galvanize this vital session so that it reaches a fruitful and happy conclusion. My delegation  therefore  wishes to pledge its unreserved commitment and fullest co-operation in all the crucial deliberations ahead of this body.The delegation of Swaziland also wishes to express its warm and heartfelt appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka of Zambia. Indeed  my delegation salutes that fellow African and brother from our part of Africa  who not only demonstrated his skill and prudence but also  in conducting the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  showed excellent leadership abilities.I should like once again to convey our profound gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and the entire staff of the United Nations for the noble service they continue to render the international community. We also commend them for the excellent United Nations reports before us and their untiring zeal in the maintenance of international peace and security.The delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes at the very outset  on behalf of Her Majesty's Government and the people of Swaziland  to convey our heartfelt condolences to the people and Government of Mexico in connection with the recent tragedy  entailing a heavy loss of human life and destruction of property  in the wake of the devastating earthquakes in their beloved country.It is my delegation's strongest and sincerest conviction and we firmly assert that anniversaries are times for serious reflection and stocktaking  particularly in the management of international political statecraft. I therefore consider that the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provides Member States with a rare and excellent opportunity for this. We cannot fail to mention that we in Swaziland have vivid and painful memories of the First and Second World Wars and their historic aftermath. Indeed  it was an era marked by the total destruction of man's achievements on our planet and of gigantic disruption of global diplomacy that laid the foundations of dangerous theses about the proper conduct of international diplomacy. If we do not take advantage of this present opportunity  the present generations will never forgive us for missing this golden opportunity to save mankind from disaster.It is my honest observation that it is human nature and almost customary for people to make massive charges of failure and criticisms about anything on earth  and the United Nations is no exception. However  on the contrary  we in the Kingdom of Swaziland attach great significance to the existence of the United Nations and to the expanding roles it plays for the sole benefit of mankind. Thus  we continue to cherish our membership of this body.Above all  we in Swaziland salute the excellent and admirable achievements of the United Nations in matters of decolonization  achievements that have even changed the membership of this Organization from a mere 51 Member States in 1945 to 159 today.We are also grateful to the United Nations for its efforts and measures towards achieving international economic co-operation and for the role that it plays in encouraging Member States to observe human rights and fundamental freedoms. Indeed  one may well shudder at the idea of a world without the United Nations  even given its fair share of omissions.Today we live in an unstable world  a world threatened by all kinds of conflicts  be they inter-state or global. It is therefore incumbent upon us as Member States of the United Nations  to uphold Hie Charter and to interpret its sacrosanct provisions with the utmost care. International peace and security seem to be elusive nowadays. Many nations tend to be indifferent to resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. We therefore note with grave concern that  should such a trend persist unabated  Armageddon will soon befall the world  and peaceful economic development and good-neighborliness will be things of the past.My delegation views socio-economic and political developments in southern Africa with added concern. Indeed  the question of apartheid policies as instituted by the Government of South Africa was first placed upon the agenda of this very august body years and years ago. Ever since  this Assembly has debated the issue and passed numerous resolutions and declarations  condemning apartheid in South Africa. Furthermore  Member States of the United Nations have continued to call strongly on South Africa to move progressively from its racial policies of discrimination based solely upon the color of one's skin and to give universal suffrage to all its people  but to no avail.We in Swaziland recognize the urgent need to establish a non-racial society based upon the fundamental norms of democracy  whereby participation by all the people  irrespective of their color  race  politics or religious creed  is sacrosanct.Our delegation further asserts that the problems of South Africa must be solved peacefully  for violence has never benefited anybody  but has brought its sinister and pernicious lesson of counter-productivity. We are therefore greatly perturbed at witnessing this blood-bath unprecedented in modern history unleashed by the apartheid policies in that part of our world.However  it is the view of Her Majesty's Government that it is perhaps not too late to effect drastic changes inside South Africa  and that South Africa  as a first step  should release all political prisoners unconditionally and then begin a process of negotiations with all genuine leaders of the black community.It is exactly 14 years since the Security Council terminated the colonial Mandate of South Africa to administer Namibia. Moreover  resolution after resolution has been unanimously passed by this Assembly  appealing to south Africa to relinquish Namibia. Above all  it is also a sacrosanct principle that the Namibians  like all other people  should enjoy the right to self-determination and national independence.On the other hand  like many others  my country had higher hopes and expectations when the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) unanimously and  for that matter  with the overwhelming support of the leading Western countries. However  my delegation observes with grave concern that such well-intentioned efforts emanating from the solidarity of the international community have been thwarted by certain Member States in utter disregard for the independence and aspirations of the Namibian people.We therefore continue to assert that the Namibians have suffered for too long and call for the urgent implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in order to save mankind from yet another carnage of war and gross threats to international peace and security.The delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland further views with a sense of shock and dismay the rapid deterioration of peace and security in our southern African region. We are perturbed by the aggressive policies of destabilization aimed atthe disruption of both our economic and political stability  and especially in Mozambique after the signing of the Nkomati accord.Swaziland has suffered economically as a result of the repeated derailment of railway trucks taking our exports to the port of Maputo in Mozambique.The disturbances that occur in neighboring countries have an overspill effect on the Kingdom of Swaziland. Thus we find ourselves having to share the meager resources available with the uncontrollable influx of refugees from neighboring States.We note with concern that whenever the question of destabilization in the region arises  Swaziland is at least partly  if not completely  disregarded  in spite of its contribution towards peace in that region.I once again reaffirm that Swaziland strongly believes in the policy and philosophy of peaceful negotiations  a philosophy whose firm foundations were laid down by our beloved late King Sobhuza II. Above all  history has taught us time and again that violence has never benefited anybody but has left its sinister legacy of counter-violence.My delegation cannot fail to express its serious concern about the fact that we have witnessed  over the years  gross violations of the United Nations Charter  and particularly of Article 2  paragraphs 3 and 4  and Article 33  to the detriment of international peace and security. It is therefore the concern of Her Majesty's Government that the explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East  and created by the Persian Gulf war and the protracted occupation of Kampuchea  Afghanistan and Chad  continues to deprive the people of those countries of their inalienable and sacrosanct right to self-determination. He also note with grave concern that such tendencies are a direct cause of tension  and therefore pose a grave threat to both regional peace and international security. My delegation firmly believes that peace in those areas of conflict can be achieved only by the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from and the end of interference in those trouble-spots of our time.In our pursuit of world peace and security  it is important that we refer to the sensitive political situation that continues to divide North and South Korea. My delegation submits that the reunification of Korea is a matter to be decided by the Koreans themselves in direct inter-Korean negotiations. It remains for the United Nations to continue to encourage the resumption of those talks without preconditions or external interference.The delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland is equally perturbed by developments in Central and Latin America. We therefore urge all the parties concerned to exercise both moral and political constraints and resolve their differences through peaceful contacts; all possible assistance must be given to the Contadora Group for the creation of bridges of peace in that troubled area of the region.My delegation is also particularly perturbed by the recent trend aimed at dismantling the role of multilateralism in international economic relations.I also view with the utmost concern the plight of the economies of many developing countries due to unfavorable international economic scenarios. Thus  my delegation wishes further to assert that Swaziland is a small land-locked country whose economic development depends solely on the goodwill of natural forces and external trade. The unprecedented decline in commodity prices and unfavorable international economic scenarios therefore represent a major blow to our fragile economy.In conclusion  the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to reaffirm that Swaziland is a peace-loving country  whose foreign policy is dictated by pragmatism rather than political and ideological realism. Whence our continued concern regarding the unprecedented escalation of the proliferation of dangerous nuclear armaments  whose end result will be the total destruction of mankind.Above all  the Kingdom of Swaziland is an ardent believer in the norms of international economic co-operation  and in the positive spirit of multilateralism.Thus  at this fortieth session of the United Nations our country expresses its firm conviction in and continued adherence to the United Nations Charter  and reiterates that the United Nations remains the only appropriate international forum for finding solutions to the major world problems today. Therefore  it is incumbent upon all of us as States Members to renew our dedication and commitment to the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations."
"118",6644,"SYR",40,1985,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. This session has acquired particular significance since it coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations.Bonds of history  culture and civilization have linked your beautiful country  Spain  and its great people to my country  Syria  and the Arab people ever since Damascus was the capital of the first Arab State. It is indeed a source of pride and satisfaction to us to see you assuming this high office. We are fully confident that your distinguished diplomatic experience and your exceptional qualifications are a sure guarantee of the success of this session in yielding the most favorable results  for the benefit of mankind.I take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Ambassador Paul Lusaka  the outgoing President  whose wisdom enriched the work of the thirty-ninth session and helped it realize significant steps and worthy achievements.The untiring efforts exerted by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the United Nations Secretary-General  to enhance the role of the United Nations in international relations  have earned our great admiration and appreciation. While wishing him further success in his work  we reiterate our full support for him in his major and difficult task of achieving a more effective role for the United Nations in bringing about peace  justice and prosperity in the world.I take this opportunity to express to the Government and people of Mexico the heartfelt sorrow of the Syrian Government and people over the tragic consequences of the recent disaster  the earthquake in their country.This session  which coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of our world Organization  deserves to witness a drastic change  giving the Organization a new impetus to enhance its role as the most effective instrument and most appropriate.framework for achieving economic and social progress  safeguarding peace in the world and consolidating the principles on which international relations are based.In the light of the present deteriorating international situation  this anniversary should be regarded as a further incentive to mobilize efforts with the aim of finding solutions to intricate international problems  eliminating all forms of racism  colonialism and neo-colonialism  checking aggression and creating the best circumstances to bring about justice for the oppressed peoples  thus respecting their rights and sovereignty over their territories and sparing the coming generations the scourge of wars and destruction.Looking back over these 40 years  one cannot but note with appreciation the important and effective role which the United Nations has played in assisting in the decolonization of a great number of countries and peoples victims of colonialism  racism and exploitation. Syria  as a founding Member of our Organization  has unfailingly contributed to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations. Syria has done its utmost in this regard through its active membership in the Committee on decolonization since it was established 25 years ago to implement the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  whose twenty-fifth anniversary our Organization is now celebrating.We also highly appreciate the significant achievements of the international Organization and its specialized agencies in solving many problems in the fields of economic  cultural  social and scientific development in those countries  which  after being liberated from the yoke of colonialism  have faced a burdensome inheritance of economic difficulties as well as of social and political hotbeds of tension  which have undermined the independence of those countries and forced some of them to fall once again under the domination of the forces of imperialism and neo-colonialism.In the midst of our celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  we owe it to ourselves to pause in humility and to reflect as we remember the victims of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This event will remain a terrible nightmare and a costly lesson to mankind and must not be repeated in the future in any manner whatsoever.No one can claim that the lesson of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been well learned so long as the nuclear-arms race is escalating and the deployment of bases in various parts of the globe is continuing. Likewise  no one can be optimistic and reassured about the future of mankind so long as the leadership of world imperialism rejoices in its nuclear potential and insists on militarizing outer space.The danger of this new development does not lie only in the increase in the lethal nuclear capabilities  inasmuch as part of those capabilities that already exist on earth are sufficient to destroy all forms of life on it; nor does it lie only in the tremendous expenditures of hundreds of billions of dollars  which could otherwise have been used to combat famine and disease and solve problems of development. Rather  the major danger lies in the fact that the launching of a new nuclear arms race in outer space would divert the attention of both the Governments and the peoples of the world from the serious efforts that should be made for disarmament on our planet. Consequently  it is certain that if the preoccupation of the United Rations with tackling this problem and the debate surrounding it do not succeed in preventing the militarization of outer space  that will undermine the world Organization's capability of dealing with the many regional hotbeds of tension  the most dangerous of which are the Middle East and southern Africa. Such a situation would afford appropriate opportunities for exploitation by the racist regimes in Tel Aviv and Pretoria in persisting in their aggressive expansionist policies  their oppressive and brutal practices and their continuous attempts to impose their will and humiliating conditions on the Arabs and Africans.The 40 years of the life of the United Nations have provided the oppressed peoples with an opportunity to liberate themselves from the yoke of colonialism and achieve their national independence. Empires from which the sun had never set have collapsed; and the number of independent nations has considerably risen  from 51 Member States in 1945 to 159 Member States at present  in 1985  thus paving the way for a more just and equitable era of international relations under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.No one can doubt that the United Nations has played an effective role in affirming the independence of these States and extending assistance to them whenever their independence has been jeopardized. Regrettably  however  the United Nations has remained unable to solve the problems of the Middle East and southern Africa. We may conclude without hesitation that the Tel Aviv and Pretoria regimes  because of the continuous and unlimited support of world imperialism  have been gradually able over the past four decades to expand their areas of occupation  consolidate their military potentials  escalate their aggression and oppressive practices  strengthen their racist doctrines and forge the history of peoples and the geography of nations - with no end to this appearing to be imminent. It can also be said without exaggeration that the United Nations has more or less succeeded in its search for solutions to the problems which it has faced since its establishment  with the exception of the problems of the Middle East and of southern Africa  which remain unresolved. The sole reason for this is that racism and Zionism survive only by defying the law and taking the law into their own hands. Their records at the United Nations provide ample proof of this.A quick review of the figures clearly indicates that the Zionist entity  through a series of wars  occupation  expansion and faits accomplis  has greatly increased in size in terms of both its area and its population. The Israeli objective is clear and may be summarized as follows: to occupy Arab territories  uproot the indigenous population and establish a greater Israel capable of imposing domination and hegemony over the peoples and States of the region.This morning the news media reported that Israeli military jets had carried out an act of aggression against Tunisia  a sister Arab State and a Member of this Organization  violating its sovereignty and causing huge loss of life and damage to property. The Israeli military jets violated international air space and endangered international aviation.This is not the first time that Israel has carried out such an act of aggression. It has in the past violated the sovereignty of several Arab States of the region. Israel's objective is clear and although examples and proofs abound it will suffice to recall a statement made by a former Israeli Prime Minister  the present Minister of Defense  in July 1976 during a banquet given by former United States President Gerald Ford on the occasion of the bicentenary of American independence. He said:""You Americans had a population of 3 million 200 years ago  while today you have become a great Power... The population of Israel today is 3 million  and we want to become a great Power in the future.""In the Israeli concept  peace is virtually synonymous with hegemony and expansion. The Israelis imagine that through direct negotiations and by scrapping the role of the United Nations the Arab side will be compelled to accept the burdensome terms of capitulation which Israel conceives to be peace. That is what happened with Egypt  the largest Arab State  whose foreign policy since the conclusion of the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty has been governed by considerations beyond its control. When the Israelis were shelling Beirut with tons of bombs  Egyptian officials were quoted as saying:""We suffer and grieve for Lebanon and we wished as a moral stand at least to sever diplomatic relations with Israel  the aggressor. However  we cannot do that. We are unable to do it because the Israeli troops would return to the banks of the Suez Canal on the following day. Moreover  our Egyptian army is no longer prepared to defend Egypt when confronted by the Israelis."" What kind of peace is this between Israel and Egypt? Is it possible for normal relations to be established between the Egyptian people and the Israelis in the light of those Israeli notions of peace?In Lebanon too the Israelis tried to impose their concept of peace  but this time at gunpoint as Israeli tanks surrounded the Lebanese presidential palace. With the help of their American accomplices  the Israelis imposed on Lebanon the agreement of 17 May 1983  which included terms and conditions no less  and possibly more  unjust and humiliating than those imposed on Egypt. Lebanon would thus have been turned into an Israeli-American protectorate  but for the bold and historic decision taken by the Lebanese people to abrogate the agreement  with the absolute support of Syria under the leadership of President Hafez Al-Assad. On the abrogation of that humiliating agreement the United States Administration issued direct warnings to the effect that it was for those who scrapped the agreement to get the Israelis out of Lebanon. In other words  the United States was encouraging the Israelis to remain in Lebanon. Once again  a shining landmark in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict was established when President Assad resolved decisively that""Syria will extend all-out support to the national resistance until the last Israeli soldier has left Lebanon"". There were successive waves of martyrs  ushering in the defeat of the Israeli troops. Consequently the excuse of ""Israeli security"" - which means menacing Arab security with impunity - has been completely discredited.The Israelis are now trying to regain in the border area  which they call a security belt  and are refusing to implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). Meanwhile  the operations of the heroic national resistance continue; their glory radiates beyond the borders to invigorate resistance in the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights and unite all resistance  thus opening a new chapter of heroic struggle against Israeli occupation.The Israeli occupation forces have inflicted horrible destruction and devastation on Lebanese towns  villages and farms  leaving behind scores of thousands of victims and bereaved families. The objective of the Israeli troops was clearly to destroy Lebanon in order to occupy it  and to tear it apart if they were compelled to withdraw from it.Israel's claim that it has nothing to do with the current explosions  fighting and anarchy in Lebanon does not change the facts. It is true that the structure of the Lebanese system is not flawless and that the seeds of contradiction exist in its institutions. That is recognized and admitted by the Lebanese themselves  and that is why they are calling for the reform of that system. But it is also true that the horrible devastation  brutal massacres and tremendous suffering inflicted by the Israeli occupation troops on the Lebanese have generated in the minds and consciousness of the Lebanese people highly explosive feelings of bitterness  hatred and vengeance. Those feelings have had tragic consequences as they have exploded among the Lebanese or between the Lebanese and the Palestinians. On the other hand  those feelings have had a splendid  heroic aspect when embodied in the operations of the national resistance to the Israeli occupiers.That is how we in Syria perceive this issue and why we are exerting all possible efforts to help our Lebanese brothers put an end to their ordeal  achieve national reconciliation and restore security and stability throughout their country. By the same token we shall assist and back the brave Lebanese national resistance until Lebanon is totally liberated and the phase of reform and reconstruction begins Syria has consistently sought the achievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. We have strongly supported the United Nations resolutions relevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question. Along with its sister Arab countries  Syria contributed to the unanimous adoption of an Arab Peace Plan in Fez in 1982. The Plan calls for Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and for the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right of return  to self-determination and to establish their independent State on their native soil  with Jerusalem as its capital. We support the call for the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties to the conflict  as well as the two super-Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States of America.Because Syria stands firmly against attempts to exclude and circumvent the United Nations  we strongly condemn all separate and partial solutions  such as the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty. Syria regards the current attempts to market the Amman agreement of 11 February 1985 and put it in a public auction as tantamount to denying the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  foremost among which is the right to establish their independent State on their native soil  which has been reaffirmed frequently by United Nations resolutions in the past 40 years. It is axiomatic that the renunciation of an independent Palestinian State would make the concept of self-determination useless and devoid of meaning.The economic crisis and acute social and political tensions in the world in recent years must prompt the industrialized countries to realize that the maintenance of a one-way course of prosperity and development is no longer possible in our time  particularly when all peoples of the world look forward to the establishment of normal  balanced international economic relations based on mutual trust  to the benefit of mankind.The terrible famine suffered by some African countries  the burdensome debts borne by many countries of the world  particularly in Latin America  and the decline in growth rates in most countries cannot be truly remedied in the absence of an equitable world economic order and with the continuing frenzied arms race on earth and in outer space.Today the arms race undoubtedly represents the major obstacle in the search for solutions to other problems and the social and economic tensions resulting therefrom. The maintenance of international peace and security can be realized not through the arms race but only through respect for rights  the establishment of justice and the elimination of all aspects and forms of aggression and racism.Syria backs all efforts designed to lead to the cessation of the production of nuclear weapons and the destruction of stockpiles. It also condemns the current attempts of world imperialism to militarize outer space  which is the common heritage of all mankind. Syria calls for the full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and for new agreements to limit the arms race and ban the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear tests.The connection between European security and the security of the Mediterranean region is a geographical fact that cannot be ignored. Any security measures which may be adopted in Europe must be accompanied at the same time by similar security measures in the Mediterranean region  along with international guarantees not to use the nuclear installations existing on the territories of some European countries against Mediterranean countries.The Syrian Arab Republic? which supports the transformation of the Mediterranean region into a zone of peace and a nuclear-weapon-free zone  would like once more to draw the attention of the international community to the fact that Israel's nuclear capabilities and its persistent refusal to ratify the Non-Proliferation Treaty and f.o place its nuclear installations under international safeguards pose a real threat to the security of both the Mediterranean countries and the Middle East and impede the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. The Syrian Arab Republic fully supports the transformation of the Middle East region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone  in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly  in order to ease tension in the region.Syria contributed to the establishment of the United Nations and it upholds the purposes and principles of the Charter. Its people is one of the peoples of the third world  whose causes and national liberation movements Syria supports  and it will not yield to aggression or compromise its principles. At the same time  Syria is fully aware of its role and commitments in both the Arab and the international arenas.Inspired by its principles  Syria contributes with all the means at its disposal to the serious search for a peace that guarantees the restoration of national rights and human dignity  redresses injustices and eliminates aggression. Accordingly  Syria firmly backs the just struggle waged by the African peoples against the racist regime in South Africa. He believe that the courageous uprising of our African brethren in recent months .is a shining landmark on the path towards the elimination of racism in southern Africa. The alliance between the South African regime and the racist regime in Tel Aviv and their collaboration in all fields  in particular the military and nuclear fields  as well as the co-ordination of their aggressive policies and chaises against the African and the Arab peoples  must be met with better co-ordination and increased co-operation among the Arab and African countries in various domains.It is no exaggeration to say that the continuing aggressive and racist policies of the Pretoria and Tel Aviv regimes remains the fuse most likely to ignite the international situation and confront the world with a potential nuclear disaster. The continuance of the strategic alliance between the United States of America and those two racist regimes  and the fact that the United States is supplying them with all the means of aggression while obstructing the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against them  constitute the main reason for the isolation of the United States in the international arena and the condemnation of its policies in the world.The question of Cyprus remains one of the most complex problems causing concern to the international community in general and to the non-aligned Mediterranean States in particular. This is because of its implications for the security and stability of the entire region. The just solution of this question can be achieved only through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions in such a way as to preserve for the Republic of Cyprus its sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status and by means of negotiations between the two Cypriot communities. We sincerely hope that the endeavors of the United Nations Secretary-General will be crowned with success.With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  we reaffirm the need to recognize the right of the legitimate Afghan Government to defend its country's independence and sovereignty against any foreign interference. We are totally committed to ensuring that this country  which is linked to ours by ancient historical ties  remains a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.We hope that the countries  neighboring on Afghanistan  with which we have the same close historical ties  will be able to resolve the difficulties among themselves. We are closely following the ongoing negotiations in Geneva  through the representative of the Secretary-General  and we wish him all success.The reunification of the two parts of Korea has become an urgent necessity in keeping with the interests of international peace and the Korean people. In our view  the implementation of the United Nations resolution relevant to the Korean problem  which calls upon the United States of America to withdraw its forces from South Korea  is the right course for solving the problem.Current developments in Central America and the Caribbean  which have acquired serious dimensions  cannot be isolated from United States acts of intervention aimed at preventing the peoples of the region  foremost among which is the heroic people of Nicaragua  from exercising their right to self-determination and opting for the systems of their own choice. These are manifested in the threat or use of force  accompanied by pressures  political blackmail  economic blockades and the financing of mercenaries and their use to destabilize regimes that reject subservience and hegemony.The process of decolonization and the achievements in the scientific and technological fields witnessed during the last 40 years have shortened distances among nations and have considerably narrowed gaps among peoples. Yet numerous problems on our globe have kept growing and seem to remain without solutions in sight. The arms race is spiraling uncontrollably and is apt to reach outer space.Hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world may still explode at any moment. Hundreds of millions of people in the third world are experiencing difficulties in securing the very minimum of food  clothing  lodging and education. None the less  the presence of the United Nations per se will represent a major achievement should the leaders of the world resolve to seek appropriate solutions for these problems within the framework of constructive international co-operation in order to create a better world free from all forms of oppression and aggression and where justice and peace prevail."

The founding fathers of the United Nations  drawing upon the lessons of the war  resolutely resolved  inter alia  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.It is to those principles that nations of every continent and all ideologies desirous of working within the context of that document so essential to the realization of the ideals of peace  solidarity and independence and to thesafeguarding of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State adhere.Today  40 years after the adoption of the Charter  the international situation continues to give rise to concern and our Organization is beset by numerous ills.The vagaries of nature spare no region of the world: drought  desertification and famine rage in our countries in the African Sahel; typhoons kill thousands in Asia  and in the Americas earthquakes devastate cities and entire regions. But the peoples of many countries are also suffering from conflicts arising out of the unjust and aggressive behavior of certain regimes; ideological conflicts  border disputes and acts of open aggression are all sources of tension and suffering.The poorer countries like my own are particularly threatened by such acts of aggression. As the international public well knows  a typical example of such gratuitous aggression is the occupation by Libya of the northern part of Chad.Notwithstanding the agreement signed on 17 September 1984 by France and Libya for the concerted  simultaneous withdrawal of their troops from Chad  only the French forces have withdrawn from my country. The Libyan troops have not pulled back an inch. At present they are occupying 550 000 square kilometers of our territory  or almost half the country. Worse still  the Libyan Army is constantly strengthening its positions  in defiance of the sacrosanct principles of the United Nations Charter and the charter of the Organization of African Unity.In the northern part of my country Libya has concentrated several battalions of its army  equipped with assault tanks  heavy artillery and troop-carrying vehicles and supported by many fighter bombers and combat helicopters.A gigantic support system is in place to supply that occupation force by land and by air. Libya has build landing strips at Faya  Fada  Aouzou and Ouadi Doum. In the locality of the last are the headquarters of the invading army and the longest landing strip  which is 4 300 meters long.The occupiers are proceeding with the systematic Libyanization of northern Chad. Our national flag has been publicly burned and replaced by that of the invader. The Green Book has become the only acceptable mode of thinking in the whole of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti; the population of the occupied zone are force to carry Libyan identity cards; only Libyan currency - the dinar - is accepted in Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti  and the French language has been banned in the area. In order to wipe out any Chadian identity in the region  the Libyan army has destroyed historic monuments and burned archives. And  in order to establish a Libyan-style administration  a Libyan governor has been appointed to head the region.The Libyan army  eager to complete its annexationist operation  is carrying out mass deportations. It collects people together under the pretext of distributing food to them; they are then marched off to airports  such as that at Ouadi Doum  from where transport aircraft take them to Libya by force.In the face of such impositions  such daily harassment and inhuman treatment meted out by the Libyan soldiers  the inhabitants of Faya and of other localities in the occupied zone rebelled at the beginning of last month. The outcome of that unequal combat can be imagined.With the deliberate aim of impeding the efforts at national reconciliation undertaken by the Government of Chad  Libya has made hostages of our brothers of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti  a region it is occupying and seeking to annex.I take this opportunity once again to invite the Libyan Government to enter into sincere talks with the framework of Chad with a view to resolving our border disputes within the framework of bodies to which both of our countries belong  whether it be the United Nations or the Organization of African Unity. It is our hope that our neighbor and brother peoples will once again live in complete harmony and that Chad will regain peace and unity through national reconciliation in order that it may devote itself to rebuilding its devastated economy.The Chadian people harbors no hatred towards the Libyan people. Chad also makes no claim on Libyan territory. We are in favor of a negotiated settlement of all disputes and for peaceful coexistence based on respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of each State.My country  Chad  is among the least developed. Not only are we lacking in resources but indeed we must strive to close several gaps all at once. The President of the Republic of Chad  El-Hadj Hussein Habre  said on this score:""The war Khadaffi is imposing on us compels us to make immense human and material sacrifices which  obviously  have adverse repercussions on all we do in seeking economic and social progress  hence it weakens our action  and by hampering the results we could legitimately expect  deprives us of the tangible results of our efforts."" The fact is that  on the one hand  we must cope with military aggression  financed by heavy doses of petro-dollars while  on the other hand  we must rebuild our economy ravaged as it is by war  drought and desertification.Famine has killed several thousand Chadians yet again this year. Still others owe their survival solely to international humanitarian aid and the help of fraternal countries. Thousands of children will not experience normal growth because of the effects of malnutrition. The situation remains precarious notwithstanding the return of the rains over these last several months. The fact is that a single rainy season  however favorable  cannot overcome so prolonged a famine.I should like here-to thank all countries and all persons of good will who have provided and continue to provide assistance to the Chadian people during these trying times. I should also like to thank the countries  humanitarian organizations and financial agencies that demonstrated active solidarity towardsmy country  at the International Conference on Assistance to Chad  held in Geneva in November 1982. The help provided following that Conference devoted to emergency aid allowed us to meet some of the most immediate needs of our people. Moreover  thanks to the results of that particular Conference  we have managed to rebuild the infrastructure of our administration  devastated by war.As the new season begins we hope to embark on the reconstruction phase of our economy. Our priority objectives will be as follows: stepping up agricultural production  developing human resources  fighting desertification and restoring roads and the industrial infrastructure.With this in mind  Chad will organize a round table of creditors to be held from 4-6 December 1985 in Geneva pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 38/214 and 39/195. An interim development plan will be put before the donors and contributors of funds for financing. The success of this program  quite obviously  will hinge on the financial backing of the international community. On behalf of the Chadian Government and people I appeal to the international community for its co-operation and solidarity  and invite all countries and international organizations to take part in that round table.The particularly difficult situation facing my country does not cause us to forget the alarming insecurity and tension in southern Africa and the Maghreb  the Middle East  Asia and the Arab Persian Gulf.In addition to the privations  violations of human dignity and harassment imposed in Azania by the policy of the big stick  the white minority regime has begun an operation aimed at extermination of the black majority. Since 21 July of this year an unwarranted state of emergency has been declared  not a day has gone by without deaths  almost always those of blacks killed by the police  for reasons so unjustified as funerals. The police kill a black  the day of his funeral the police killed still other blacks the day of the funerals of the latter  it kills still more blacks  and the cycle goes on. It will not stop until the international community imposes sanctions compelling and restrictive enough to bring the racist Pretoria regime to give up its apartheid policy and to grant to blacks rights identical to those which the whites enjoy.By the same token the international community must firmly bring pressure to bear on the Government of South Africa to compel it to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia and to enable that Territory  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) finally to achieve independence.In the Middle East the situation is equally alarming and threatens to extend to other regions as well. We believe that the leadership in the countries concerned must seek an equitable and lasting solution because only a political solution  in our opinion  can resolve this long-standing crisis.As far as the conflict between Iraq and Iran is concerned  we support the efforts of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  with a view to a negotiated peace.The panorama of international relations is rendered gloomier still by the existing economic imbalance. What is obvious is that within so unfavorable a climate the situation of Africa cannot be other than catastrophic. That is indeed why  fully aware of the nature and scope of the crisis  the African States have just devoted to that topic the twenty-first summit of their Heads of State and Government  a summit during which a major declaration called the Declaration on the Economic Situation in Africa was adopted. That Declaration spells out the measures to be taken as well as the action to be launched.In so doing  the African States have shown that the primary task of combating the crisis and restructuring their economies is incumbent above all on themselves.However  they feel their efforts will have no real impact on their economies unless they are supported by assistance from the international community.On this  the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we should welcome the fact that this Organization has managed to survive all the upheavals that have marked inter-State relations. Notwithstanding the aggressions of which our countries are victims  notwithstanding the natural problems that remain unresolved  Chad still places its trust in the United Nations and remains devoted to the humanistic and peaceful principles laid down in its Charter.That is why  as we reflect on the major outlines of what we are to do in years to come  we must not shrink from coming to grips with weaknesses and shortcomings  so as to draw the lessons that will enable the United Nations to become an effective instrument for co-operation  solidarity  respect for the principles of independence  for non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States  and for the territorial integrity of States.Awaiting a better day we  in Chad  call upon the international community to induce Libya to withdraw its troops from our territory so as to enable the people of Chad finally to achieve peace and to recover its territorial integrity."
"120",6735,"TGO",40,1985,"First and foremost  I should like to join those personalities and representatives who have addressed the Assembly before me to express once again the very strong sympathy and firm solidarity of the people and Government of Togo with the people and Government of Mexico following the devastating earthquake that recently saddened their capital and country. The toll in human lives and material damage have deeply moved us. We therefore firmly support the General Assembly's response and actively encourage the action taken by the international community to come to Mexico's aid.One of the major lessons that emerged from the Second World War was the need to transcend political  ideological and socio-cultural barriers with a view to consolidating international peace and security and promoting the economic and social progress of humanity. Towards this end  indeed  the United Nations was created 40 years ago.As a symbol of the determination of mankind once and for all to guard against new temptations of conquest and domination  the United Nations figures among the most noble ambitions ever conceived by human genius.This ambition  sustained by the powerful joint determination of the founding nations and since then jealously nurtured by the whole international community  has withstood the test of time  thus retaining its full legitimacy.The present session of the General Assembly is being held in the course of a a year to the credit of which history will  in its glorious annals  record events of far-reaching significance  such as the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  the fortieth anniversary of the inception of the United Nations itself  and the proclamation of the International Year of Peace. As an important milestone  the fortieth session must bear the stamp of our loyal attachment to having these noble ideals that gather us here endure  along with having us hold high the banner of our firm commitment to strive for the strengthening of the efficacy of our common endeavor.Carrying out essential missions assigned to our Organization thus calls for and is worth our casting a twofold look  back to the past and forward to the future. In this connection  what is reassuring is to note that  in view of the scope of its activities and the multiplicity of the functions it carries out  the United Nations has proved to be itself as an indispensable tool for maintaining world-wide comprehensive balance.That overall balance has benefited largely from the growing awareness and recognition by all States Members and peoples of the validity of the principles and objectives of our Organization  particularly in terms of the importance of peace  security  human dignity and international co-operation. As we know  strengthening this balance will depend on the political willingness of all Member States to abide by United Nations decisions.It is equally reassuring to note that  thanks to the continued growth in the ranks of States Members  which today number more than three times those at the inception of the Organization  the United Nations has clearly confirmed not only its universalist worth but also the irresistible power of its ideals. Thus we see a whole range of reasons that give us cause for pride and satisfaction - reasons which are the underpinning of our assessment of the role and proper place of the United Nations in a constantly changing world.At the same time  however  a single tree cannot cover the entire forest  because 40 years without a generalized holocaust  40 years without a new world war  is not synonymous with 40 years of the absolute peace  serenity and profound harmony of which the founders of our Organization dreamed. Indeed  growing awareness of the dangers of a third world war and the need to ward it off has engendered scientific research coupled with the use of more subtle types of confrontation.How can anyone be astonished if  in view of this fact  the international community has gone through 40 years of such proliferation of arms and increasing sophistication of threats to peace  the continued existence of the policy of domination in economic  financial and military terms  and a widening of the gap separating the rich from the poor countries? Do we not herein find a whole range of gaps undermining the effectiveness of the United Nations system and much evidence that multilateralism is in crisis?Guided by the considerations linked to the historical context within which this gathering is being held  I am fully aware of the considerable weight of responsibility that has been placed on the shoulders of Ambassador de Pinies in a spirit of admirable unanimity as he presides over this fortieth session. Chance has seen to it that  one of the permanent representatives invested with the greatest authority should hold this lofty office.Aware of his rich and vast diplomatic experience marked by insight  level-headedness and wisdom  I am deeply convinced that this session will be crowned with exceptional success commensurate with the fortieth anniversary. He comes from a country - Spain - with which Togo maintains ties of profound friendship and with which geography and history have linked us  providing the best guarantees for better understanding of different civilizations and peoples.In wholeheartedly congratulating him cm his resounding election  I assure him of my delegation's fullest co-operation for the successful accomplishment of his lofty mission.We still recall the climate of serenity  courtesy and dialog that marked the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. That state of affairs  which without a doubt marked a positive trend we hope will continue  can be explained by a certain degree of maturity our Assembly seems to have gained  particularly in terms of a certain clear-sightedness  pragmatism and sense of balance infused into the Assembly by Mr. Paul Lusaka as he led the thirty-ninth session.His presidency of that session and indeed of the United Nations Council for Namibia are offices in which Mr. Lusaka has displayed an enthusiasm and dedication bearing witness to his profound faith in the noble ideals of the United Nations. Such willingness to make himself fully available to the Organization has also done honor to his country and all of Africa. We pay him a ringing tribute. Such willingness to work for the Organization deserves from this entire Assembly the most heartfelt congratulations.To ensure sustained efficacy  what we do here in our joint undertaking must -and we are fully aware of this - be based on timely initiatives from one of the key players in the Organization  the Secretary-General. In this connection  it seems to me only right to pay a tribute to and congratulate Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar on the originality and exactness of his way of viewing his lofty functions which permeate his work style. At the risk of affronting his singular modesty  my delegation fully appreciates the manifold efforts he has exerted in his tireless search for solutions to the painful problems that continue to arise throughout the third world  such as fratricidal conflicts in Asia and the Middle East  and natural disasters in Africa  Latin America and elsewhere.While the world has not known a generalized holocaust in the past 40 years  the fact is that war has changed in scope and sought other theaters of operation. Hence confrontation of a direct and generalized kind has yielded to a mushrooming of conflicts throughout the third world. Genuine local wars by proxy  these conflicts for the most part the rivalries and antagonisms pitting the major Powers without breaking their devotion to safeguarding the peace existing between them.The fact is that peace cannot be the subject of any kind of monopoly  because it is indivisible  the precious possession of mankind and the primary aim of the United Nations. It is therefore important for us to see to it that conflict situations still persisting here and there throughout the world are the object of an in-depth assessment by all States Members leading to solutions acceptable to all parties - in other words  solutions founded on tolerance  mutual understanding and a sincere determination to co-operate.Given that perspective and the proclamation of the International Year of Peace  respect for the right of peoples to peace now requires that Asia be freed of invasion forces and fratricidal conflicts and that Africa be totally liberated from colonialism  apartheid and outside interference. Respect for the right of peoples to peace also demands that the Middle East reach peaceful coexistence among all peoples  without distinction as to race  religion and political conviction  within the framework of independent and sovereign States; and  finally  that South America be freed of the last vestiges of colonialism.Situations of fait accompli noted today in Asia run the risk of tarnishing the image and prestige of our Organization by challenging its credibility and moral authority. The fact that massive military forces have been deployed by foreign forces in Afghanistan to break the people's resistance clearly shows a determination to subjugate that full-fledged member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.However  the indifference of the Power concerned to the relevant General Assembly resolutions calling for the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan must in no way undermine our near unanimity of purpose to fight by all legal ways and means fully to implement those General Assembly resolutions.Pursuing the resistance struggle under the courageous leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk against the foreign occupation troops  the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea has shown that no sacrifice is too great in its attempt to regain freedom  sovereignty and territorial integrity for Kampuchea. This heroic resistance on the part of the freedom fighters is thus deserving of the entire international community's increased support until Democratic Kampuchea regains its total independence. As far as my country is concerned  it resolutely supports the struggle and will join in every initiative aimed at resolving the Kampuchean question. This is why Togo has made it a point to be a sponsor of the resolution on Kampuchea.The failure of numerous attempts at settling the Iran-Iraqi conflict reflects the dangerous escalation of hostilities there. It is highly detrimental to international peace and security for excessive nationalism and geo-political calculations to turn this conflict into a kind of total war encompassing without distinction nor consideration civilian and military targets  cities and rural areas. Moreover  it is extremely disquieting to note that five years of bloody conflict  having taken a heavy toll in human lives and material damage  in no way seems to have weakened the determination of either side to achieve a military victory which seems an illusory goal. It is high time for the leaders of Iran and Iraq to put an end to the hostilities  to agree to start negotiations and acknowledge that this is the only realistic way for an equitable settlement of their dispute.It is also high time for the United Nations to consider measures with a view to discouraging the purveyors of weapons who continue to fuel this focal point of tension. Having followed with interest the mediation efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General  my country feels that pursuing this initiative is likely to contribute to a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq.Safeguarding and strengthening peace on the Asian continent also demands that the Korean people  after 40 years of division  distrust and confrontation  regain harmony peacefully and independently within the context of a reunified State. To that end  it is highly desirable that the North Korean leadership's willingness to open a dialog  rapidly finds a favorable echo on the part of the South Korean authorities. In this connection  the Government of Togo supports the three-point plan proposed by the North Korean side for reunification of the country.The areas of turmoil in Africa are still the result of greed  external interference and cunning geo-political calculations. For the sake of stability in Africa itself and of a more balanced world  reducing and eliminating these tensions is an imperative and urgent task which the African States and the international community must tackle.As to the Western Sahara  Togo supports the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations and appeals to the parties concerned to join in the negotiations with a view to settling this conflict peacefully.As for the crisis in Chad  this is still of extreme concern to the Government of Togo  and my country thus invites the international community to support the efforts of the Brazzaville Conference aimed at direct negotiations between the legal Government of Chad and all opposition factions.Under pressure from the fierce resistance of the freedom-fighters and the condemnation of the international community and world public opinion  major breaches have been made in the apartheid system. Thus  following the obvious failure of the policy of bantustanization and institutional reforms  eminent leaders of the party in power have acknowledged the serious internal contradictions in the white regime and the aberration of the apartheid doctrine. Given such a background  the pursuit of this ferocious repression against the black majority and the destabilizing maneuvers aimed at neighboring countries in southern Africa bear witness to the panic of the racists in power  with their backs against the wall  facing despair  and aware of the fact that they have reached a turning point in their history. Either apartheid is gradually dismantled from within or it will be swept away in violence and under the impact of external factors. Facing such a dilemma  the South African regime  indeed struck to its very core  is proliferating its acts of aggression  notably its most recent interventions in Angola as if to defy the United Nations and the international community.My country stands side by side with the Government and people of Angola  supports their struggle and firmly condemns the racist South African regime for its policy of oppression  social repression and aggression. The time is thus ripe for increasing various forms of pressure on South Africa  including the use of economic sanctions. In this connection  we welcome the initiatives taken by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States in adopting-a bill that envisages such sanctions  and we hope that it will be voted upon and become law  thus serving as an example to other countries.The trade restrictions decided upon against the apartheid regime by the Scandinavian countries and Canada  followed by other countries  may prove useful  and the decision taken by France to freeze its investments in South Africa is encouraging. These measures serve as a serious warning to the racist Government. We hail the courage and determination of the Governments concerned for the series of measures that they have launched against this regime which is a blot on mankind. We are obliged to France for its positive initiatives taken in the Security Council. We are also grateful to the other Security Council members for the support they have lent the French initiatives.In terms of the measures taken to isolate the apartheid regime  economic sanctions are all the more timely  in as much as they are likely to unfreeze the decolonization process for Namibia. To be sure  the Security Council unanimously condemns the setting up in Namibia of an interim government by South Africa and recommends voluntary economic sanctions against the apartheid regime. It remains essential  however  to ensure that direct pressure is brought to hear on the Pretoria Government to compel it to give up this new neo-colonialist maneuver and to recognize that the only valid approach is to grant independence under Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without any linkage to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.The Middle Bast has now gained the alarming reputation of being an area in a quasi-permanent state of upheaval. We have a situation here which poses one of the most serious threats to our Organization and it must take up this challenge forthwith.The civil war in Lebanon is so fraught with horror  harassment and genocide that we must do more than merely raise our voices in despair. At a time when a people is dying and a country falling into ruins  it is essential that our wall of hypocritical indifference and guilty silence tumble and that we reconsider the mandate entrusted to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with a view to increasing its ability to maintain peace* For this operation to have any chance at success it should receive the dynamic co-operation of those Powers which are directly or covertly involved in the civil war in Lebanon  along with the support of the Lebanese leadership. The growing antagonism of the opposing factions makes the question of Palestine even more delicate and distressing.The recent bombing of the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Tunisia by the Israeli Air Force  in defiance of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of our Organization  and in violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law  may well extend the conflict to other States in the area. My Government lends its firm support and solidarity to the Government and people of Tunisia. In the context of an equitable settlement of the Palestinian question  my delegation supports the idea of convening an international conference attended by all the parties concerned  including the major Powers.Benefiting from scientific innovations and modern technology  the arms industry has expanded to such an extent that today we are witnessing the production and stockpiling of a whole panoply of weapons. This is an alarming fact  indeed. The destructive capacity of these weapons is unprecedented and is far beyond that of the weapons used in the two world wars  including notably the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.In this context  the forthcoming proclamation of the International Year of Peace must incite the inter national community; and in particular the major arms producers  to face up to their responsibilities. Even if the defense of territorial integrity and national sovereignty justifies the existence  equipment and maintenance of a national army in each country  the arms trade must cease to depend exclusively on the logic of profit motivations and political-ideological motivations  and be subordinated to a socio-humanitarian ethic instead. The control to be exercised over that trade implies the use of selective criteria that are likely in the future to obviate the risk of conflict in centers of tension or in areas of potential hostility.The strengthening of international security imposes on the super-Powers the duty to pursue their dialog with perseverance with a view to concluding agreements on nuclear disarmament in order to reduce the climate of distrust that continues to prevail between them. The world-wide disarmament campaign must be intensified so as to make world public opinion more aware of the dangers of the balance of terror.As all peoples are entitled to live in peace  each State must contribute effectively to the achievement of the objectives of that campaign.It was for this reason that  in August 1984  my country organized a national seminar on peace and disarmament  that it was host to the International Conference on Peace and Human Rights in January 1985  and finally to the Regional Conference on Security  Disarmament and Development  which has just been held from 13 to 16 August 1985 in Lone. In this connection  it is appropriate to note that this latter Conference adopted the so-called Lome Declaration and Program of Action with a view to attaining the objectives of security  disarmament and development.The resumption of economic growth noted in the past two year in certain developed countries has not had the anticipated beneficial effect on the international economic situation. Quite the contrary  the international economic crisis has become worse throughout the world  and particularly in the developing countries. Indeed  the economic situation of those countries continues to deteriorate sharply as a result of the combined impact of the 1980 recession and the restrictive policies applied by the developed countries in respect of trade  money and finance. In the field of international trade  and in violation of the Declaration adopted by the Ministerial Meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) held in 1982  certain developed countries continue to pursue protectionist policies marked by a proliferation of tariff and non-tariff barriers to free trade.As a result  the markets in which the developing countries can sell their products are becoming scarcer  while at the same time the prices of the raw materials they export have dropped on the whole by over 10 per cent in two years  reflecting the desire of the developed countries to allow the scandalous deterioration of terms of trade and the widening gap separating the rich countries from the poor to continue. In this connection  my delegation supports the proposal to hold a new round of GATT negotiations with a view to solving the problems encountered in the field of international trade  taking into account the special situation of the developing countries.With reference to the generalized system of preferences for the benefit of the developing countries  my delegation feels it is necessary to reconfirm and reinforce those preferences without reference to any reciprocity clause.In the field of money and finance  the international monetary system remains incapable of correcting the major financial imbalances confronting the developing countries. Interest rates are still excessively high  and the debt burden has become unbearable. Trends in debt servicing have resulted in one of the most striking paradoxes of our time. For the developing countries  which are precisely those that are most in need of financial resources for their economic and social development  in 1984 became net exporters of capital to the developed countries. Our country supports the solution to the problems of external indebtedness that was adopted by the Twenty-first Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity. If the principle of repayment is acceptable  it must be recognized that such repayment must not have repercussions on the very precarious socio-economic situation of the developing countries. Repayment of debt is  moreover  linked to an improvement of the economic situation in the third world countries in general  and in Africa in particular.At the same time the financial resources of international development institutions continue to decline  thus accentuating the multilateral co-operation crisis.Trade  monetary  financial and development problems are closely interconnected. That is why six years ago the developing countries took the initiative in calling for global negotiations on economic co-operation for development. Notwithstanding the efforts and concessions made by the developing countries  the question of launching global negotiations remains deadlocked for lack of the necessary political will on the part of the developed countries or  more accurately  because of their determination to continue to cling to the privileges conferred upon them by an anachronistic international economic order.This year in Luanda  the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the non-aligned countries addressed an appeal to the developed countries for them finally to agree jointly with the developing countries to join in global negotiations on the basis of the two-stage approach proposed at the Seventh Summit Meeting of the Non-Aligned Countries in New Delhi. My delegation hopes that the developed countries will seize the opportunity afforded by the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of our Organization to reply favorably to that appeal and at this session begin these long-awaited negotiations.Pending the start of the global negotiations and their ultimate conclusion  it is important that immediate and urgent steps be taken in the interest of the developing countries. That is why Togo also supports the earliest possible convening of an international conference on monetary and financial questions  with a view to resolving  among other things  the problems of indebtedness and development financing.Within the context of the gloomy picture marking the economies of the developing countries in general  the situation in Africa is particularly glaring. In Africa the alarming manifestations and symptoms of the world-wide economic crisis have grown considerably worse under the twofold impact of drought and desertification and of declining prices of raw materials exported by the continent. In this regard  the international community has displayed reassuring solidarity in providing many kinds of aid to the people affected. My delegation takes this opportunity to thank the countries that are friends of Africa  along with all those individuals whose generosity  creative genius and hard work have made it possible to alleviate the plight of the victims of natural disasters inAfrica. But it is not enough  however  to come to grips with emergency situations. What matters also is for the international community to adopt appropriate measures with a view to supporting African countries in their medium and long-term development efforts. For their part  the Heads of African States gathered in Addis Ababa at the Twenty-first Summit Meeting of the Organization of African Unity shouldered their responsibility. It remains for the international community to assume its own responsibilities. In this connection  my delegation welcomes the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa. That special session of the General Assembly could be held at the beginning of next year.The forty-second session of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity  held in Addis Ababa from 10 to 17 July 1985  adopted a resolution declaring that the Antarctic must be the common heritage of mankind. That resolution seeks to extend international co-operation to the Antarctic region in the best interests of all mankind. We appeal to all States to study this issue at the current session of the General Assembly with the full attention it deserves.The men and women who survived the unspeakable horrors of war doubtless appreciate much more than we do the incalculable value of freedom  human dignity and peace. These men and women who have seen their countries reborn out of the ashes and regain economic momentum benefiting from aid provided by friendly countries hardly need academic exercises to profess their faith in solidarity among peoples and the interdependence of nations. Above and beyond any other consideration  the witness those men and women bear confirms how right and just are the ideals that inspired the founding of our Organization.Better than any theory/ that witness borne by those men and women who learned from the lessons taught by history is conducive to consolidating our conviction of the need to strive tirelessly to safeguard and give tangible expression to the noble principles and objectives of the United Nations.In the 40 years of existence of our community we have learned that the most influential voices belong to those who  supported by their economic  financial and military advantages  know how to accommodate themselves to the search for appropriate solutions to the multiple and complex problems of our time.If world equilibrium  at present so fragile and precarious  is to be stabilized once and for all it must depend essentially no longer on the goodwill of the great Powers but rather on the concerted efforts of all countries  large or small  that cherish peace and particularly on the efforts of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries  as an essential instrument in strengthening international peace and security.If the Movement is to play a greater role in resolving the burning questions of concern to our Organization and to be able to uphold and defend the noble ideals of the United Nations  it is urgently necessary for us to close our ranks and strengthen our cohesion and solidarity.Thus  on behalf of my country  Togo  I invite all non-aligned countries to promote the consolidation of the structures of the Movement  an end to internecine wrangling and the intensification and diversification of South-South co-operation.If the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations can give birth to new hope for the strengthening of peace and trust among nations and the advent of more just and equitable co-operation  our Organization will give stronger proof than ever of the reason for its existence.If we honor the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations by some signs heralding the progressive elimination of existing hotbeds of tension  the effective resumption of negotiations on nuclear disarmament and the partial recasting of international economic relations  we shall have proved that men and women on this earth  which for everyone's sake we want to be a peaceful one  are far more keenly aware than might be thought of our common destiny."

Your election to this high position is a manifestation of the esteem and respect in which the Member countries of the United Nations hold you. Moreover  we are confident that your renowned diplomatic skill and wide experience  as well as your intimate knowledge of the United Nations over so many years  will be of inestimable value to the General Assembly in its deliberations on many important issues. Your country  Spain  has been throughout history  and remains today  one of the greatest founts of Western civilization and culture. Spain and Thailand have witnessed a long-standing relationship between our two peoples dating back many centuries. Both our countries have similar institutions  the Monarchy and a parliamentary form of government  and enjoy close and cordial relations with each other. My delegation is  therefore  deeply gratified to see you presiding over this Assembly.In the same manner  I wish on behalf of my delegation to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Lusaka  a distinguished son of Zambia and of Africa and President of the General Assembly at the thirty-ninth session. His qualities of leadership  dedication and wisdom have earned him our profound respect  admiration and gratitude.My delegation also wishes to extend its warm congratulations to all the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly  representing the different regions of the world. Their elections clearly reflect the diversity  as well as the universality  of our Organization.On behalf of the Government and the people of Thailand  as well as on my own behalf  I wish to express to the Government and the people of Mexico our profound sympathy and sincere condolences over the natural disaster caused by recent earthquakes resulting in the loss of so many lives and much damage to property.Forty years have passed since the United Nations came into existence. The past four decades have witnessed the expansion of the activities of the United Nations to all the far-flung corners of the globe and in nearly every field of human endeavor. While the focus of the world Organization remains constantly on the avoidance of another global conflagration  the areas where the greatest expansion has occurred are concerned with the alleviation of human suffering and the betterment of peoples on planet Earth.Out of the ashes of the Second World War rose the United Nations  casting an aura of hope on war-ravaged nations for a resurgence of reason and a new era of peace. The kind of reason that should prevail was seen as a vindication of human aspirations over the raison d'etat. Powerful Governments had been blind to human yearnings and had led their peoples to war. From now on  succeeding generations must be saved from the scourge of war. For peace to endure there must be a collective will to enforce it. Such a will would be expressed through sanctions declared by the Organization where representatives are appointed by their Governments. In principle  it is the correct approach  since the Organization is composed of sovereign States. However  subsequent developments have demonstrated that the basis on which the United Nations was founded has been weakened by violations of the principles enshrined in the Charter. As long as Governments adhere strictly to their obligations under the Charter  the Organization will undoubtedly be able to respond  in full measure  to the requirements of our contemporary world.Herein might lie one of the inherent imperfections of the Organization. The assumption that the genuine aspirations and yearnings of peoples are expressed through their Governments has not always been proved correct. Governments do not necessarily always follow human exigencies in their conduct of foreign policy. Often the vagaries of human experience cannot be brought to bear upon hard and urgent issues which require prompt and decisive actions.Yet the United Nations can only be - in the words of the first Secretary-General of the United Nations  Trygve Lie - ""what the Member Governments want it to be - neither better nor worse"".More recently  the present Secretary-General  in his current report on the work of the Organization  has written:""It is mainly up to Governments to decide if they wish to co-operate in building ... a useful  coherent  effective institution  or whether they choose the alternative that may sometimes seem easier in the short run  each taking their own short-sighted and self-interested course."" However  there is growing evidence that public debate in a forum where Government representatives must sooner or later be responsive to public reaction has brought about an emerging awareness of the human dimensions in international affairs. Not only has the individual been vested with greater rights and duties on the international scene  but many international problems are viewed more and more in human terms.Technological advances in mass communications have also assisted in bringing the pathos and drama of human tragedies to wider audiences. Public opinion is influenced by what we read  hear or see - from the tragic conflicts in the Middle East and Central America and the plight of starving peoples in the Sahel to the displaced persons fleeing foreign aggression and occupation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the oppressed blacks of Namibia and South Africa yearning for liberty and human dignity.There are also efforts to distort and misrepresent information for public consumption. However  such efforts are designed also to appeal to the heart and to the head. In the battle to win minds over such important issues as man's survival and development  human fears and needs are often cited. Thus  ordinary human beings and their concerns have come more and more to assume a central role on the international stage.The United Nation? has also been instrumental in bringing this situation about. With its earlier preoccupation with decolonization  the majority of its Members today are States whose peoples had been subjected to colonial rule. The fact that they have been liberated from the yoke of colonialism imbues the process of decolonization with human significance and appeal. The* same process continues today with regard to the situation in Namibia and elsewhere.The work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and other bodies in the fields of economic and social development has gained and retained world-wide support because of its human dimensions. Indeed  it is not surprising that such programs as those concerning immunization of the world's children  a better habitat for the rural population  the role of women in development and food security for all command unanimous support.By the same token  perception in human terms of such issues as the nuclear arms race  terrorism and indiscriminate violence has given rise to wide-ranging public debates and been given the increasing attention of Governments and international forums. The danger of nuclear war is rightly perceived as the ultimate threat against not just States or Governments but mankind itself. For this reason  Thailand welcomes the decision of President Reagan of the United States and General Secretary Gorbachev of the Soviet Union to hold a summit meeting in Geneva in November of this year.% delegation therefore believes that the credibility and indeed the future viability of the United Nations depend on the perception of men and nations of how well the Organization continues to maintain not only international peace and security but also its capacity to improve the existence of and the prospects for the human individual.On peace and security  my delegation agrees with the assessment of the Secretary-General in his annual report  particularly on the useful role of the Security Council. It is indeed an honor for Thailand to be elected to serve as a non-permanent member of that body  for the first time in our history  and we have tried to approach all issues with moderation and objectivity on the basis of principle and in the interest of peace and harmony among nations. The fact that Thailand does not belong to any ideological grouping in the Council should assist it in obtaining a balanced perception of many issues.The important issues which come before the General Assembly tend also to involve international peace and security and  at the same time  relate to the human consequences which require international humanitarian action. The situations in southern Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan and Kampuchea are cases in point. All these problems confront the international community with the task of coping with the massive influx of refugees and displaced persons into neighboring countries. While aggression  foreign occupation and alien domination continue unabated  the cries of the victims have not gone unnoticed by this Assembly.On Kampuchea  for instance  the General Assembly has adopted by an increasing majority resolutions which condemn the foreign aggressor and its military occupation in its small  hapless neighbor  thus posing a threat to peace and security in the whole region and beyond. The same resolutions also address the enormous humanitarian problems arising from the tragic situation. The significant support rendered by the international community year after year is proof that the plight of the Kampuchean people speaks more loudly than any cunning maneuver or confusing tactic on the part of the aggressor. Ultimately  however  the root cause of the problem  namely  the illegal Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea  must be resolved so as to enable the Kampuchean people to exercise their basic human right to self-determination.Other problems which touch individuals and their livelihood are also being given higher priorities on the international agenda. While such problems as food shortages and drug abuse seriously impair the social and economic fabric of societies  their main impact is still perceived to be on the individual. This accounts for the outpouring of sympathy and support for the victims from all walks of life  transcending geographical and ideological boundaries. The food aid programs for Ethiopia and other African countries and the forthcoming consensus to convene an international conference on drugs evince the immediacy of public concern over these problems. Perhaps there is a need to emphasize in a similar manner the human dimensions of such other problems as North-South issues in order to obtain greater public support and wider international co-operation. In his annual report  the Secretary-General states:""We are facing economic changes of such magnitude and complexity that no country can adjust to them in isolation. We see this  for example  in attempts to protect domestic jobs from import competition  which result in the exporting of unemployment. What is clearly required is a wider vision and more dynamic understanding of the global nature of the problems we are facing. Such a vision has to be based on the open recognition of interdependence and the practical necessity of a fair sharing of burdens and of the accommodation of others."" (A/40/1  p. 10)There are few problems deserving of urgent international attention than poverty  which affects the economic and social well-being of a billion people. While pundits and politicians tend to discuss such issues in the abstract or in keeping with the narrow interests of their constituencies  statesmen should be endowed with sufficient foresight to see the immense catastrophe into"" which this situation  if prolonged or exacerbated  would lead all of us.There are areas where a government  with the support of the people  must be primarily responsible for corrective measures or necessary adjustments. The Royal Thai Government is among those governments  in particular in the developing world  which can be proud of numerous achievements in the economic and social fields. However there are matters that go beyond the pale of domestic jurisdiction which can worsen prospects for all  especially the developing countries. Because of their backwardness and vulnerable position  the poorer countries  and the poorer people in those countries  would be the first to succumb to the fall-out from a trade war. Such problems as the international debt crisis and the rise of protectionism in the industrialized countries can spell only unmitigated disaster  first of all for the developing countries  followed by world-wide repercussions.The better alternative is to work together to develop a freer economic climate and trading system where all parties would derive just and lasting benefits. Small developing countries can resort to regional co-operation in order to ensure for themselves and their own peoples a greater measure of self-reliance and confidence in dealing with others. This does not mean that such regional endeavors are designed to create a confrontation with other countries or groups. On the contrary  co-operation that is based on equality yields more lasting benefits in the long run.What good would the Third United Nations Development Decade do if millions of poor families became destitute owing to a loss of their honest livelihoods in a world that has sought to heighten their consciousness  hopes and expectations?How can human rights be relevant if over 20 million black people in South Africa and the entire Palestinian people are deprived of their basic rights and human dignity and millions of peoples of Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Namibia are forced either to live under foreign occupation or flee their homeland? To what extent can the quality of life be improved when man is living under the constant threat of annihilation and when ever larger amounts of resources are being expended on destructive weapons instead of being put to constructive use?In the forthcoming decade the United Nations should therefore focus more of its attention on such questions  where the benefit would belong to the vast majority of the people of the world. Thus the results of the United Nations efforts would be felt  more and more  in their hearts and minds. In turn the Organization's relevance would be enhanced in their perception  thus gaining their loyal and active support for an organization then that would become a genuine ""town meeting"" of the world.Let the next decade begin with a fanfare for the common man.I should like to close by paying a warm tribute to our Secretary-General. It is fitting that he should be the one to oversee the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of this Organization. He has served with great distinction as the permanent representative of his country and has spent many years in the Secretariat in senior and responsible positions. He knows the United Nations inside and out  so to speak. His commitment is to the success of the world Organization and its noble aims and objectives. Thailand is host to many United Nations bodies  including the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the regional headquarters of several specialized agencies. While Thailand' has derived some benefit from this  the benefit is not one-sided but accrues also to the Organization  as well as to its Members.As we enter a new decade  I should like to pledge Thailand's unstinted co-operation with the Secretary-General in fulfilling the commitment we share in common."
"122",6897,"TTO",40,1985,"It is a pleasure for me  on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  to offer our congratulations to the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly during this fortieth session of our Organization. His long association with the United Nations as a representative of Spain  and his vast experience in international affairs will  I am confident  ensure that this commemorative session contributes substantially towards the attainment of the goals  enshrined in our Charter  of world peace  justice and economic and social progress. I gladly avail myself of this opportunity also to pay a deserved tribute to Mr. Paul Lusaka of Zambia  who presided so capably over the work of the General Assembly at its thirty-ninth session.On behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago  I convey to the Government and people of Mexico our heartfelt sympathy over the extensive destruction and loss of life resulting from the recent earthquakes.It is a sobering commentary on the status of many countries 40 years ago  and on the enormous changes that have since taken place  that of the 159 Members of our Organization more than half were not independent when the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco in 1945. Indeed  nearly a quarter of the Member States represented here today  my own included  gained their independence as late as the decade of the 1960s  which saw an acceleration of the process of the dissolution of the world-wide system of colonialism. Thus do the resolve of people and the passage of time bring about changes which reshape the course of history.Every anniversary provides an opportunity  if not for rejoicing  at least for reflection  and as we reflect upon the events of the 40 years since the inauguration of our Assembly  it may be useful to examine that period in terms of what it has meant to us  Member states of the Organization.In doing so we may consider the period from several standpoints: as having been one of 40 years of strengthening the Organization; of 40 years of trying to resolve conflicts; of 40 years of searching for agreement on disarmament; of 40 years of furthering economic  social and cultural development. But some may ask ""Have they been 40 years of advancement or of retrogression or stalemate? Has it been a period of continuing confidence and hope in the future of the world  or one of despair over a world seemingly still torn apart by its contradictions?""When he addressed the commemorative meeting in San Francisco earlier this year  our Secretary-General boldly faced that question  and listed a number of areas in which the multilateralism embodied in the United Nations provides the necessary structure within which nations can work together for progress that no nation acting alone can accomplish. He was not overstating the role of the United Nations when he declared that for 40 years the Organization had provided the catalyst  the framework and the machinery for the continued common engagement in the betterment of the human condition upon which the peace of the world has depended so much.The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes and applauds the invaluable achievements of the United Nations  which have been articulated by the Secretary-General and several representatives who have addressed the Assembly. There is  in fact  clear evidence in many parts of the world that several of the objectives set out in the Charter have been  or are being  realized. We may take much satisfaction in those achievements. But this is not an occasion only  or even primarily  for self-congratulation. We must be equally candid in acknowledging that  despite our efforts  solutions to many contentious issues still seem to be elusive and that much more work remains to be done. Many of the objectives and purposes of the Charter have been only partially achieved  and the consequent disappointment has tended to engender frustration and disillusionment and to retardprogress. There is evident need for a renewal of our commitment to the objectives and purposes of our Charter.In the area of economic and social development  the responsibilities of the United Nations must of necessity be more important and far-reaching today than in 1945. The United Nations now comprises 159 sovereign States  but some three quarters of the world's population dwell in States whose inherited social and economic structures still confine them to a peripheral position outside the mainstream of the international economic and financial system.The Charter of the United Nations contains a pledge - that the people of the United Nations are determined to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic advancement of all peoples. Yet the quest  in which we in the developing world repose so much hope and faith  for the new international economic order that would establish a world economic system predicated on justice and equality  is still to be completed. Indeed  it is not even being seriously considered in some quarters. The developed States must surely have recognized by now that the proposed new international economic order does not constitute a threat to their economic well-being  but that it is a concept designed primarily to restructure economic interaction and promote the economic growth of all peoples.Unhappily  indifference and inaction have confronted all the efforts to bring about global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  the elaboration of a code of conduct on transnational corporations  the establishment of a long-term financing system for science and technology for development and the attainment of the targets and objectives mutually agreed in the International Development Strategy for the Third united Nations Development Decade.It is hardly surprising  therefore  that the critical  ever-worsening economic situation throughout the world continues to be a cause of serious concern and that developing States  which once looked to multilateral financing institutions to assist them with their complex economic problems  are now  with good reason  losing faith in them. Their discouragement is aggravated by the fact that any demonstration of economic improvement by any of those countries tends to bring with it the application of concepts such as that of graduation  which alters their eligibility status and entails the loss of much-needed assistance from trading partners and international development organizations.That is not all. One of the most serious problems facing developing States is that of massive and spiraling debt  and their inability not merely to repay the capital but even to meet the huge interest payments unilaterally prescribed. In fact  developing States have been forced to seek new loans to meet interest payments on previous loans. It is difficult to see where the spiral will end. A debt must always be honored. There is  however  the concomitant responsibility on the part of the developed world to ensure that the terms are such that they do not defeat the objective for which the loan was contracted and do not cause economic strangulation. The flexibility necessary to keep payments attuned to the socio-economic perspective must be retained.Sources of long-term financing are crucial to the economic program of developing States  and it is clear that those States cannot afford  as they are now required  to borrow at commercial rather than at concessional rates. Yet  the cost of borrowing from the institutions engaged in international finance  which were supposedly designed as the machinery for the promotion of the economic development of all peoples  has become economically too high and politically too explosive for most developing countries. Why impose on today's developing countries conditions of financing so much more onerous than those experienced by the present developed countries in the early stages of their growth and development?Another serious problem facing developing countries is the spread of trade protectionism. Those developing States which  by their sustained efforts towards development have managed to create manufacturing and industrial sectors that are able to compete with those of developed States  often find that methods are devised to bar the entry of their products into the markets of the developed economies. At the same time  forces beyond the control of developing countries  and unmindful of their particular circumstances  dictate the prices and the conditions of purchase of their traditional primary products. The terms of trade continue to move inexorably against those States  with inevitable adverse consequences for their balance-of-payment positions.Since developing States are not being adequately remunerated for their primary products and are prevented from selling whatever else they produce and manufacture  they have been left in the invidious position of possessing insufficient funds to purchase the products of other States. As a result  the level of economic activity in the developing States has declined  unemployment is increasing and their capacity to maintain trade  even among themselves  is being considerably undermined.Over the years  the United Nations has sought to address and resolve questions such as these through the establishment of a number of agencies and institutions. However  despite the activities of organizations such as the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  the progress towards development in many countries of the world has generally been slow. These agencies have  none the less  played a positive role in seeking to give practical effect to the principles on which the United Nations system was founded. They have demonstrated a keen awareness of  and sensitivity to the problems and needs of developing States. But the financial difficulties which certain of these agencies have latterly encountered  in part because support from some Member States has tended to decline  have had the effect of impairing the ability of the United Nations system to function in accordance with the principles enunciated by its founders.We should  perhaps  acknowledge that the median isms of collaboration and co-operation in the United Nations system are of value only to the extent that they assist in the attainment of the Organization's objectives. Over the years  we have elaborated and refined our perspective in this regard. But can the problem be that insufficient attention has been given to evaluating the mechanisms employed to attain these objectives? Perhaps this fortieth session might well give priority to addressing these issues.The Charter sets out a number of objectives aimed at satisfying the unrelenting quest for justice  freedom  equality  peace and economic and social advancement. We have made much progress towards each of these goals  but none of us  after 40 years of effort  can feel fully satisfied with what we have accomplished. Our disappointment is  perhaps  most acute in respect of the Charter's requirement that we promote and encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all  without distinction as to race  sex  language or religious belief. Our attention is directed daily to more and more cases of violation of human rights and denial of fundamental freedoms. In no area of the world are the violation of human rights and the denial of freedoms more offensive to the spirit and the principles of the Charter of our Organization than in South Africa.We are surely not alone in this Assembly in holding fast to the belief that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with the right to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Representing  as I do  a country whose National Anthem proudly proclaims ""...Every creed and race find an equal place..."" I cannot find words expressive enough of my country's repugnance at that odious system of apartheid that discriminates against people on the basis of their race and color.Our Organization was founded 40 years ago in order that the world might never again be faced with the evils of nazism. But we meet today  conscious that an evil no less great continues to confront us. We are all aware of the similarities between nazism and apartheid  both founded on the spurious doctrine of racial superiority. Just as nazism was in the 1940s  apartheid is  equally today  a threat to international peace and security. Nazism was overcome by international effort  by a collective effort to which many of the then dependent countries contributed with their material and human resources. I need not elaborate on the number of young men and women  the flower of the populations of countries still under the yoke of colonialism  who volunteered and sacrificed their lives in the fight against Nazism. Is it too much to ask for a similar concerted international effort to overcome apartheid? Is it too much to ask today that all countries take those steps which will contribute effectively to the efforts to secure the total eradication from the face of the earth of this pernicious system? That is not too much to ask. We call upon all the Member States of the United Nations to implement fully the many resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council concerning South Africa and to apply immediately the measures provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter. We must move with dispatch and a sense of urgency. Unless we do  there will be no end to the spiraling violence which has claimed so many lives in South Africa.A related source of disappointment to our Organization must be our continuing failure to secure compliance by South Africa with resolutions and decisions demanding that it end its illegal occupation of Namibia and allow the people of Namibia to exercise their right to self-determination. In addition. South Africa has paid no heed to the repeated condemnation by this Organization of its acts of armed aggression against neighboring States  in contemptuous defiance of world opinion and of the principles of the Charter to which it once purported to subscribe. No Member State should be allowed to arrogate unto itself the right to flout with impunity the just and legitimate decisions of this Organization. Yet  that is exactly what South Africa continues to do  daring the Organization to prevent it or to punish it. Against all reasoning  urging  and warning  it remains obdurate and unrepentant.Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its concern over the number of areas of tension which remain volatile and of regional conflicts which continue to defy solution  thereby threatening international peace and security. The need to respect principles of territorial integrity and of non-interference  and to adhere to the principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  has never been greater. In this regard  we reaffirm our confidence that the situation in Central America can be resolved through regional negotiations  and we express our continuing support for the efforts of the Contadora group. We also welcome the recent creation of the support group  comprising Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  to assist in the Contadora process. It is our earnest hope that those joint efforts  and the goodwill of the countries directly involved  will bring about an early end to the conflict in Central America.Trinidad and Tobago notes with much satisfaction the resumption of dialog between the two Koreas which has led to the recent exchange of visits by families. We urge that the dialog be continued in a spirit of greater understanding and co-operation so as to ensure a peaceful solution to the Korean problem. We also note the situation in South-East Asia and propose that all the parties involved enter into or continue dialog to resolve conflict in that area.Our Secretary-General has been untiring in his efforts to find solutions to the many problems before the United Nations. Not least among them is the situation in Cyprus. It is not too much to hope that as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we shall see the resolution of this long-standing problem.The conflicts in the Middle East continue to bring suffering  misery and deprivation to the peoples of that region. In the name of humanity  a way must be found to bring their anguish to an early end.In our continuing efforts to defuse the arms race  it is significant to recall that the very first resolution of the General Assembly dealt with the question of disarmament. Yet  over the past 40 years  instead of a reduction we have witnessed a quantitative and qualitative increase in the arsenals of both nuclear and conventional weapons.It is a reproach to the conscience of this Organization that while an increasing proportion of the world's population seems doomed to continue to live in conditions of penury  squalor  famine and ill health  some countries find it necessary to spend enormous sums of money each year on a never-ending quest for arms superiority. Since the acquisition of increasing quantities of arms implies a fear - or the fact - that the conditions for peace no longer exist  is our commitment to the peace provisions of our Charter to be considered no longer credible?My delegation supports the call of the ministerial meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  held recently in Luanda  for the convening of a third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We believe that Member States acting in concert could make a meaningful contribution at such a session to efforts at halting and reversing the arms race.Trinidad and Tobago also supports the call for an international conference on the relationship between disarmament and development. Such a conference could establish the mechanisms through which the vast resources now devoted to the production of armaments could be channeled into peaceful and productive activities.We believe that security for nations is more likely to be achieved through political  social and economic co-operation than through investment in and deployment of newer and even more awesome means of mass destruction. This celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations must therefore have as one of its primary objectives the attainment of a substantial reduction in the production and proliferation of weapons of all types and the redirection of the resources now used for those purposes to secure a significant improvement in the quality of life of all peoples.When moved to compassion by harrowing televised scenes of hunger  squalor and disease afflicting countless millions throughout the world  Member States of our Organization have demonstrated that at the national level they are not lacking either in sympathy or in the capacity quickly and effectively to transform that sympathy into adequate material assistance in an emergency situation. But we evidently find it difficult to take the necessary steps to ensure that our Organization and its relevant agencies are adequately provided with the necessary requirements for averting such emergency situations.If  because of the lack of appropriate means  our Organization is rendered incapable of employing ""international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples""  as envisaged in our Charter  it will be unable to achieve the objective of promoting social progress and better standards of life.The economic and social conditions of those Member States that would most benefit from the international assistance that our Organization was intended to provide have in recent years been aggravated by the deteriorating world economic climate. Although some of our Member States are clearly in a better position than others to contribute effectively to the solution of the world's economic problems  our Charter prescribes the need for co-operative action. Member States therefore have a solemn obligation to ensure the achievement of international co-operation so that these pressing problems may be resolved. My country fully accepts that obligation and will continue  in so far as is within its power  to play its part in the attainment of that objective.As we mark this fortieth anniversary  let us remember with gratitude and sincere appreciation the invaluable contribution made by all those men and women who over the years have dedicated themselves to the growth  development and strengthening of our Organization. I particularly wish to pay tribute to our Secretary-General and to all those who preceded him in that office. Their untiring efforts have earned them an enduring place in the history of the United Nations.In appending their signatures to the Charter on 26 June 1945  the founders of our Organization declared that they did so ""in faith"". Conceived in faith  our Organization has been nurtured in optimism. Let us  on this memorable occasion  reaffirm that faith and renew that optimism so that in the years that lie ahead we may fulfill the hopes and aspirations that inspired the founders and that must continue to inspire those of us to whom the torch has been passed.Greater things than have thus far been accomplished are pressing upon us. Let us use this fortieth anniversary observance to rededicate ourselves to their achievement."
"123",6943,"TUN",40,1985,"I have special pleasure in expressing to Mr. Jaime de Pinies my warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency  which is a fitting culmination to a lifetime spent mostly in the service of his great country and of the United Nations.I should also like to take this opportunity to convey Tunisia's condolences to the Government and people of Mexico and also to express to them our feelings of heartfelt sympathy and sincere solidarity following the tragedy that has befallen them. The present session is taking place as our Organization is reaching maturity after 40 years of existence. The representatives of our nations will soon be gathering to celebrate as they should - this great event. We can already rejoice in this  aware as we are of the opportunity we have  which is certainly unprecedented in history  of coming together each year in ever-increasing numbers to discuss our problems  compare our points of view and endeavor as best we can to reach solutions in our common quest for a better world  a world in which peace  understanding and progress prevail.We cannot  however  hide our concern at our Organization's inability to deal with the challenges facing mankind  in particular in carrying out the paramount mission entrusted to it by the Charter  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security. This inability exists not only with respect to the means of enforcing the resolutions emerging from the deliberations of its various bodies  but also with respect to the initiatives which need to be taken and unremittingly pursued in order to prevent tensions and conflicts  to intervene at the flash point of a fire and take steps to extinguish it or at least contain it. Increasingly  it seems as if the Organization has no influence over the course of international relations and as if the treatment of the ills besetting our planet has become the prerogative of the super-Powers  whose rivalry is expanding into an ever-widening area  relegating our Organization  which nevertheless represents the entire international community  to the role of sound-box for some recording device. Thus  we should not be surprised that the problems troubling our world persist and the international situation grows steadily worse.Indeed  East-West relations continue to be tense. Although negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of nuclear weapons resumed a short while ago  rekindling hopes which had been seriously dampened by the suspension of talks for several months  missiles continue to be deployed and counter-deployed. The arms race  spreading into space  goes on. We are still far from the realization of our fundamental aspiration for collective security leading to a lasting peace and fruitful co-operation.Moreover  the succession of regional conflicts and destabilization operations jeopardize world peace and hamper the work of co-operation among nations. This development is all the more disturbing since some regimes  for which violence is the preferred instrument for advancing their hegemonistic designs  are making increasing use of force and aggression  in defiance of the principles and rules of law governing the international order. Innocent populations in Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America are faced with a dramatic situation  which heavily mortgages the development prospects of the third world and  moreover  undermines the equilibrium and stability of the international community. There is a clear field for foreign intervention and rivalry between the major-Powers which  for strategic reasons or out of self-interest  tend to accommodate themselves to the situation.The serious events unfolding in southern Africa are a perfect illustration of this state of affairs. Faced with a minority regime which has institutionalized  in an unyielding system  the total denial of the most basic human rights and the refusal to recognize the political and civil rights of the indigenous majority  the latter is fighting the good fight and making the heaviest of sacrifices. Tunisia  which has consistently supported the just causes of freedom and dignity wherever they have been at stake  feels a special affinity with the South African and Namibian peoples in their heroic struggle to win their legitimate rights. It reaffirms its unqualified support for the liberation movements which are their authentic representatives.The bloody repression which is buffeting the South African people under the state of emergency  no matter how harsh it might be  will be to no avail. The same is true of the punitive expeditions which a Government with its back to the wall is carrying out against neighboring countries. Tunisia reaffirms its support to them in the performance of their duty of active solidarity with the oppressed peoples of southern Africa  whatever the price.Never before has the Pretoria regime aroused so much indignation and criticism around the world as a result of its racist and segregationist policy. Even the countries which have continued to give it the benefit of the doubt are now joining the ranks of others which have been actively condemning that policy and advocating vigorous measures against it with a view to bringing about its demise. Let us welcome in that connection the vast movement of protest which has swept public opinion in those countries and which has not failed to elicit a response in government circles.But in spite of its isolation  the Pretoria Government has no intention of changing course. Gestures of appeasement  like the release of the African National Congress (ANC) leader  Nelson Mandela  have clearly been ruled out.In these circumstances  the international community cannot stand idly by while the situation worsens with potentially dire consequences for both Africa and the world. The United Nations must take appropriate action  such as mandatory sanctions as called for by the overwhelming majority of its Members. There is an urgent need for the United Nations to take strong measures to induce the Pretoria authorities to negotiate with the legitimate representatives of the South African people on the immediate accession by the latter to the status of a free people under a system cleansed of all discrimination and segregation.The South African tragedy extends into Namibia  where the same racist and obstinate regime persists in denying the Namibian people their right to self-determination and dignity. In so doing it defies the international community in the most blatant manner. For seven years now it has obstructed the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) calling for the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. In Namibia  as in South Africa   there is no sign that the Pretoria authorities are prepared to back down. It is therefore more necessary than ever to set a definite date for Namibian independence. In addition  members of the Security Council  especially those belonging to the contact group  must at last shoulder their responsibility to give practical effect to resolution 435 (1978)  which was adopted at their initiative.Tunisia  which has always supported the just causes of freedom and dignity everywhere  stands by the South African and Namibian people in their heroic struggle to win back their rights. It reaffirms its unreserved support for the national liberation movements and their authentic representatives.Developments in the situation in Chad  notably the agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces from Chadian territory concluded last year between France and Libya  have unfortunately not yet led to a lasting solution to the problems of that brother country in accordance with the principles of international law and the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Its territory is not yet completely liberated and national reconciliation has not yet been achieved.Tunisia has consistently called for such reconciliation as a prelude to the reconstruction of the country in unity  brotherhood and peace  free from all outside interference. Thus  it supports the commendable efforts which are being made to that end and hopes that they will soon be crowned with success.The situation in Western Sahara remains a source of uncertainty and instability in the Maghreb. Fearing a dangerous slide towards armed confrontation between the parties  which seemed a possibility in the light of the rising tensions late last year  and in response to the wishes frequently expressed to it by many friendly brother countries  Tunisia  at the instigation ofPresident Habib Bourguiba  the dean of the Heads of State of the Maghreb  took the initiative of proposing a summit meeting of the countries of the Maghreb. The main objective of the summit would be to identify the principles and  if possible  devise ways and means for achieving a united Maghreb on the basis of mutual trust  good-neighborliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of other states  the co-ordination of positions on issues of common interest and the promotion of co-operation between the countries in the region. The summit was intended to afford  in a calm and forward-looking spirit  a valuable opportunity to consider together the problems which constituted obstacles to a united Maghreb  with the problem of Western Sahara  of course  ranking first among our concerns.The first steps we took  which were well received by all concerned  produced the not insignificant result of encouraging the continuance of the talks already under way between the parties concerned with the problem of the Sahara and the initiation of new talks  one outcome of which  as Members know  was the re-establishment of relations of friendship and co-operation between Morocco and Mauritania.Unfortunately  our efforts foundered on the delicate problem of Sahara and the failure of the discussions on that issue. Tunisia had no choice but to abandon its initiative temporarily. Tunisia remains committed to the initiative because of the noble ideals on which it is based  but it is none the less aware of the long way still to go and  particularly  of the obstacles still to be overcome.One of the most serious obstacles lies in the atmosphere of growing tension induced by the regime of a country in the region which is practicing a policy known throughout the world for its deliberate lack of respect for international legality and morality and for the elementary rules governing relations of peace  friendship and co-operation among nations. As a projection of its policy  this regime is directing repeated threats against its neighbors  instigating violent acts within its borders and often threatening unequivocally to make use of military force.In the face of this dangerous situation  which could develop into a new conflict  the international community must be watchful. As for Tunisia  it will shoulder its responsibilities as it has whenever the principle of independence and its security requirements have been in question  and particularly when it has itself been directly concerned.The Middle East presents a heart rending spectacle of death and rampant destruction. It is a fire with numerous flash points which threatens to spread even further if we continue to fail to pay it the necessary attention  and which could eventually engulf the peace and security of the entire world.Tunisia reaffirms its belief that the central issue of the serious situation which plagues this troubled region is the Palestinian problem and that the reality faced by the Palestinian people  who are deprived of their legitimate rights  remains at the heart of that issue.Our Organization found a solution to this problem  which was  of course  the 1947 Plan of Partition  which in our view still constitutes the basic document in any genuine endeavor to bring about real peace and a lasting settlement of this conflict  which is now nearly as old as our Organization.It is hardly necessary to go back over what came of that Plan and the clear facts that give proof not only of the stubborn refusal of the Israeli party to comply with international law as laid down by the United Nations  but also of its unremitting intransigence in denying the Palestinian party any rights  endeavoring to rob that party irrevocably of the land that is recognized as belonging to it  rejecting any compromise proposal from any quarter whatsoever  including that of its closest allies and persisting in trying systematically to gain control and to win ground.For the present  the important thing is to stress that  as far as the Arabs are concerned  the Fez Plan  which is based on United Nations legality  provides a realistic basis for a just and lasting settlement in the region. Tunisia  which reiterates its support for the Plan  believes  however  that any solution that calls for recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish their own State and has the support of the legitimate representative of that people must be not only considered but also  and above all  backed by appropriate action on the part of the international community.In Lebanon  the Israeli army is not ending its occupation of a portion of the southern part of the country  once again on the specious pretext of guaranteeing the security of Israel. It keeps that area of Lebanon under the yoke of a military administration whose repressive activities are matched only by the arbitrary policy imposed upon the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.The failures suffered by the invader in the region are clear proof that neither a policy of the iron fist nor the recruiting of misguided militiamen will succeed in overcoming the heroic resistance of the Lebanese people.That is why the international community must call upon Israel to withdraw its forces  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982). Israeli interference in the affairs of Lebanon must cease permanently  and the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon must be established  once and for all.After five years of hostilities  during which the two belligerent countries were put to fire and sword  no end to the fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran is yet in sight.Grateful acknowledgment must be made to the Secretary-General of our Organization for having succeeded  with much effort  in sparing towns and villages large-scale shelling that was aimed at civilian targets and  thus  threatened to wipe out entire populations. However  it is urgent to put an end to this conflict  which  in addition to bringing ruin upon the two countries at war with each other  is already having a dangerous impact on the countries of the region as a whole and is on the verge of entering a stage of internationalization  which is a serious development  not counting the damage done in both countries. Some do not seem to have become aware of this serious development  and must become aware of it while there is still time.Tunisia  which is aware of how tremendously dangerous it is for this war to continue  wishes to renew its urgent appeal to the United Nations  particularly to the permanent members of the Security Council  to end this vicious circle and to prevail upon the parties to the conflict to embark on a process of peaceful settlement. Their beneficial action will be all the easier in that  let us not forget  Iraq has already accepted an immediate cease-fire supervised by the United Nations  with a view to achieving a solution in accordance with the principles of international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions.Foreign interference  in the form of armed intervention  is an obstacle to progress in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  whose populations are still being denied their inalienable right to determine their future and to have the government of their choice. We are witnessing with revulsion the successive waves of bloody repression and punitive expeditions that are triggering the exodus of millions of innocent people from their homeland. The international community appears to be obliged to act within the framework of this de facto situation characterized by flagrant violations of the principles of the Charter and of the law of nations in the two countries in question  which are full Members of our Organization.Tunisia  which has often called upon the United Nations to take energetic steps to deal with this situation  cannot but reaffirm  once again  the importance it attaches to the principles that must govern the endeavor to achieve a peaceful solution to these two conflicts  namely withdrawal of foreign forces from these two countries and respect for their independence  their territorial integrity and their status as non-aligned States  as well as the right of refugees to return to their homes.We are following the situation in Latin America very closely. We welcome the coming to power of democratic regimes in many of the countries of the region. Our satisfaction is all the greater in that this process of normalization has taken place smoothly  on the basis of a popular consensus. We are convinced that the governments which have resulted from universal suffrage will be able to realize the aspirations of their peoples and guarantee progress and prosperity for them.Our concern at the situation in Central America is mitigated by the successful action taken by the Contadora Group  which is endeavoring to bring about peace and co-operation among the States of the region. We believe that this action springs from a conciliatory state of mind and respect for the legitimate rights of the States concerned and from the principles of non-intervention and self-determination of peoples that inspire us as a State of the Maghreb. Tunisia therefore wishes to express its support for the Contadora Group and the hope that the process that has thus been set in motion will spare the countries of the region tensions and conflicts that cannot but prejudice their security and their development  as well as peace in that part of the world.The deterioration in international economic relations has resulted in a recrudescence of protectionist measures  rising external debt  and the increasing contraction of financial flows towards development and a steady drop in raw material prices  all of which represent so many challenges to be taken up by an interdependent international community.Africa  which has among its ranks 26 of the 36 poorest countries and approximately half of the refugees in the world  is without question the most seriously affected by this situation. Drought and desertification have seriously compromised the economic development process of many countries south of the Sahara  which have become dependent on international assistance to meet the basic needs of their populations.Admittedly  important initiatives have been taken at the United Nations  in the specialized agencies  and by the World Bank and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  which have resulted in an impressive surge of international solidarity  for which both its initiators and those who have responded generously to their appeal are to be commended.However  we wish to emphasize the link  which must not be forgotten  between emergency action and medium-term and long-term measures designed to give new impetus to economic growth. In addition to what is  when all is said and done  humanitarian assistance  the international community is expected to give the African countries substantial support in their endeavor to achieve stable and steady economic growth.In our view  this complementarity should have two facets. The first facet would consist in a new international division of labor  whereby economic sectors would be distributed among countries and groups of countries  taking into account the capacity and aptitudes of each country or group of countries. Africa has created a>w developed  with the financial and technological support from its partners in the developed countries  crops and industries of proven quality. By contributing to an improvement in quality through expanded financial flows and a greater transfer of technology within the framework of common projects and joint ventures  the developed countries would benefit from low-priced products obtained as a result of cheaper labor. They would deliberately abandon the economic activities in which they are still engaged  with the aid of subsidies that constitute a heavy burden for the taxpayer  and with the help of customs dues and other protective measures that are hampering international trade and bringing about an increasing disequilibrium in their African partners' balances of payment; instead  they would concentrate on activities that are more profitable for their economies  particularly those calling for advanced technological skills and financial means that are within their reach.The second facet of the desired complementarity would be the development of co-operation between regions throughout the whole continent of Africa and between African countries and countries in other regions of the world with which they have traditional threats resulting from geography and history or which are at an equivalent stage of development. The mobilization of the African countries' natural  financial and technological resources and of their markets in order to carry out joint projects in keeping with their priorities would of necessity have a beneficial effect on their development capacity.Accordingly  judicious action recommended by the various international and regional forums would be integrated into a global strategy. Partial results could be obtained without such a strategy but would not put an end to the crisis  which  it should be stressed  is affecting countries both south and north of the Sahara  although to varying degrees.This exhaustive statement  by means of which we wish to demonstrate our committed and active participation in the work of our Organization on the occasion of this anniversary session of its General Assembly  shows both the extent and the complexity of the problems confronting the international community - indeed  the challenges that it must take up. However  it also refers to approaches and policies that can be adopted in order to achieve genuine solutions that arc likely to reverse an international situation that is grim from many standpoints and that is deteriorating so fast that the point of no return may be reached.Tunisia is convinced that a better informed  more sensitized international community  one that is aware of the interdependence of its members  will have both the will and the ability to make the necessary changes. For that purpose  it assumes a prominent role for our Organization  which remains a special forum for a frank and sincere dialog directed to harmonizing points of view and bringing about the understanding required in order to improve international relations. It is also the role of the United Nations take initiatives and to carry them through by creating favorable conditions for their implementation.In that connection  we welcome the observations and suggestions made by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization.With regard to the maintenance of peace and security  we join the Secretary-General in suggesting that:""... a determined and conscious effort be made by members of the Security Council  and especially the permanent members  to use their membership to make the Council more the guardian of peace ... and less the battleground on which to fight out political and ideological differences..."" We also share the view of the Secretary-General that: ""... it has become increasingly clear in recent years that economic  financial  monetary and trade issues are so interrelated and are of such profound political and social importance that they can only be dealt with effectively as part of a wider political process.""We conclude  as the Secretary-General does that:""In the economic as in the political sphere  we are faced with the necessity of making our institutions relevant and effective in the realities of our time."""
"124",6990,"TUR",40,1985,"I have the pleasure of congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that under your guidance this session will constitute a significant and meaningful milestone in the life of the United Nations by giving us the opportunity to make an assessment of the past 40 years while trying to look constructively into the future.I wish also to pay a warm tribute to the President of the thirty-ninth session  Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia. His conduct of the work of the General Assembly contributed substantially to the success of the previous session.I should like first of all to express  on behalf of the people and Government of Turkey  our profound feelings of sorrow and condolences to the people and Government of Mexico for the terrible earthquake that occurred in Mexico recently  entailing great loss of life and heavy material damage. As a country which has often suffered from earthquakes and other natural disasters  we fully understand the tragedy that has befallen the Mexican people and sympathize with them.In trying to contribute to the collective assessment that the fortieth anniversary prompts us to make  I should first like to underline two major developments of the post-war era around which numerous other related issues seem to cluster. There have indeed been drastic and profound changes in the world during the past four decades and consequently in the thrust  scope and general orientation of international relations.First  the end of the Second World war brought in an era of sharp divisions in the form of East-West tensions coupled with ever-growing security concerns of a different magnitude. Nuclear weapons and the dilemmas arising out of their existence are also not in their fortieth year. Efforts for a progression from a cold war to a stable relationship through the search for detente and co-operation  and for arras control and disarmament  have not yet taken us to a point that could correspond to the basic assumption oE the Charter.Secondly  the world political scene has changed in more than one way  as reflected by the process of decolonization in which the United Nations has played such a decisive role. This process has in turn modified not only the composition and structure of the united Nations  but has also made a profound impact on the approach to the problems facing hundreds of millions of people as well as on their order of priorities. Decolonization has given effect and meaning to a large extent to the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples enshrined in the Charter and to the universality of the Organization. This process has yet to be completed. On the other hand  the economic problems of the developing countries have not been adequately and effectively addressed. The vision of the founding fathers of this Organization which initiated a new political order of the world should be coupled with steps towards the adjustment and improvement of the world economic structure.There is no doubt that the United Nations system has been instrumental in providing economic and technical assistance to the developing countries. However  basic problems  starting with hunger and poverty in the world and extending to the debt problem of the developing countries  have remained with us.Many global issues and regional questions on the agenda of this session have been with us from preceding years  some in fact since the inception of the Organization. As we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the new beginning made in San Francisco  persistent armed conflicts  confrontation and acts of violence continue to dominate the international scene.My Government is committed to support every realistic effort aimed at improving the international climate and promoting just and equitable solutions to existing problems through peaceful means. My Government's basic approach to all international  regional and bilateral issues is guided by the overriding importance we place on dialog and negotiations. Our geographic location and our experiences constantly enhance our awareness of the fundamental need for both regional and international peace and security. These are the main pillars of the Turkish foreign policy laid down more than 60 years ago by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  the founder of the Turkish Republic.Improvement of East-West relations is the key to progress in vital questions related to the future and indeed to the very survival of humanity. The search for detente through constructive dialog and broad co-operation  as well as the strengthening of peace by establishing a stable military balance at the lowest possible level of forces through arms control and disarmament  are the basic goals to which we reaffirm our commitment in this context.We have welcomed the negotiations in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union on their strategic and intermediate-range nuclear weapons and defense and space systems. These negotiations  intended to work out effective agreements between the two countries  enjoy the support of all nations. Moderation and restraint in the general context of international relations would facilitate the search for agreement in all three areas of negotiation.Lack of confidence has stood out- for too long as the most salient feature of the international scene and has cast uncertainty on the future by increasing tensions and risks of confrontation. The approaching summit meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union rekindled expectations for future efforts gradually to reverse this trend. We hope eventual progress towards a better understanding between the two countries will help pave the way for tangible results in other related areas.Confidence building on a wider scale .constitutes an important prerequisite for the success of disarmament initiatives. Progress on all aspects of arras control and disarmament through balanced and verifiable agreements continue to be our basic aim in this field Negotiations have been under way for verifiable reductions in conventional forces in Europe  as well as verifiable confidence-building measures covering the whole of Europe which have yet to produce militarily significant and politically binding agreements. In a world-wide context  a comprehensive and verifiable ban on chemical weapons is the imminent task in the face of the proliferation and use of such weapons.International co-operation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion is one of the basic purposes of the United Nations. Human rights  as highlighted by the Charter  embody the concept of non-discrimination and are directly related to the concepts of international peace  security and justice. Gross and persistent violations  such as the system of apartheid  are bound to provoke the reaction of the international community and lead to tensions that endanger peace and stability. Racism and racial discrimination should be eradicated in all their forms. The grave situation and the social and political unrest in South Africa arising from the policy of apartheid have continued to place a heavy burden on both the human conscience and international relations.Turkey has never established political or economic ties with the racist regime of Pretoria and on every occasion has raised its voice against the inhuman and degrading policy of the Government of South Africa against the black majority. We sincerely hope that all citizens of South Africa will soon enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms.Besides the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  1985 also marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In spite of the great contribution of the United Nations to the process of decolonization throughout these years  we are still faced with situations where colonization and oppression persist.World public opinion has this year focused more than ever its attention on developments in southern Africa and has persistently called on South Africa  both within and outside the united Nations  to alter radically its policies with regard to Namibia. The United Nations has a direct legal responsibility for the achievement of Namibian independence  through the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Namibia in accordance with the unanimously adopted resolution of the Security Council.It is clear then that unilateral action by South Africa in Namibia constitutes a direct affront to the expectations of world public opinion. . Neither the humanitarian dimension of the problem  nor the continued use of Namibian territory as an outpost for military operations can be overlooked or tolerated.As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  we shall continue to give support to the legitimate and just struggle of the people of Namibia  as well as the efforts of the Secretary-General for the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions on Namibian independence.Another area which requires better awareness and firm international co-operation is the question of terrorism in all its aspects. We hold the view that international terrorism is a direct threat to human rights. Since the right to life is the most elementary and obvious of all human rights  it should be more effectively protected against this menace. The formulation of measures and the promotion of effective international co-operation to prevent  combat and punish all acts of international terrorism have become an urgent task  when one remembers the linkages which have been identified and exposed between the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs  arms smuggling  and international terrorism  there can be no hesitation on the need to fight this very real danger against humanity and international life.I regret to say that since the last General Assembly new mass violations of human rights have been added to those already existing. In some cases national minorities  safeguarded by international agreements  are being deprived of their basic rights. Widespread oppression includes such methods as the forcible change of names and identities  interference with religious practices  proscription against cultural and ethnic preservation and injunction against emigration. No distorted historical argument may justify such flagrant violations of human rights. We hope that the international community will find ways to remedy this intolerable situation that contradicts all basic standards of contemporary societies.The tragic situation in the Middle East  which constitutes a serious threat to world peace  requires our utmost attention. We believe that a lasting solution cannot be found unless the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized. The common approach reached between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) may provide an opportunity for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. We should like to hope that all the parties directly concerned will not fail to seize the opportunities this initiative has created  with reciprocal goodwill and political vision.We are aware  however  that peace in the Middle East is indivisible and that a just and lasting comprehensive settlement in the Middle East  one that must satisfy the legitimate rights and concerns of all the parties involved  will continue to elude us until Israel withdraws from Arab territories under its occupation since 1967  including Jerusalem.It is most unfortunate that Israel  instead of adopting a conciliatory attitude that would contribute to enhancing chances for a negotiated settlement  continues to aggravate the situation further. The recent act of aggression by against the sovereignty of a peace-loving country  Tunisia  should also be condemned as a flagrant violation of international law and the basic principles of the Charter.Throughout the year  we have followed with growing concern and much anguish the developments that have tragically obscured hopes for the restoration of calm and order in Lebanon. We have always regarded the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon as an essential element for the stability of the region. In this context  Lebanon needs and deserves support from all of us in its quest foe addressing effectively the threatening chaos that has regrettably been prevailing on its soil. We should  therefore  like to call on Israel promptly to withdraw those elements of its forces that are still in southern Lebanon. Any undue delay in the removal of the obstacles preventing Lebanon from recovering its territorial integrity and achieving national reconciliation  free from any outside interference  would entail further human suffering and would hamper diplomatic efforts for peace in the Middle East as a whole.Turkey is deeply distressed by the prolongation and escalation of the war between Iran and Iraq  which endangers the stability and security of the region. Being the only neighbor of both Iran and Iraq  and having deep-rooted relations of friendship with them  we are exerting efforts to help bring the devastating war to an early end. We deeply regret the human suffering and material losses of the two nations. We also regret that the efforts made by the Secretary-General of our Organization  as well as by other eminent individuals  have not thus far produced solid results.Turkey is also trying to make its contribution to those efforts both at a bilateral level and within the framework of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. We are maintaining our dialog with the two parties and we continue to be available for any assistance we can give them. We regret that common ground has not yet been found between the two sides which might provide a basis for a mutually agreeable  lasting and honorable peace. Meanwhile Turkey has contributed  through the Turkish Red Crescent  to the exchange of prisoners-of-war between the two countries  which may to some extent alleviate the immense human suffering in this war.The situation in Afghanistan continues to be a major source of concern which adversely affects the international climate. We respect and admire the resolve of the Afghan people freely to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination  secure the withdrawal of foreign military forces from Afghanistan and ensure the voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their country. In this connection  we should also like to reiterate our appreciation to the Government of Pakistan for its sincere and constructive attitude vis-i-vis the efforts of the Secretary-General  as well as for its continued humanitarian assistance to millions of Afghan refugees. Meanwhile  repeated violations of Pakistan's air space and territory are a matter of particular concern.No less important is the situation in Kampuchea. The policy of seeking a military solution in Kampuchea which destabilizes South-East Asia and entails grave human suffering should be abandoned. A comprehensive political settlement requires the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and the exercise of the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny. In this respect  we continue to support the efforts of the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which have consistently worked for a political settlement.I should also like to stress the significance we attach to the continuing search for effective dialog in the Korean peninsula in order to develop peaceful solutions to all the questions between the two sides and thus pave the way to their representation in our universal Organization. To emphasize the humanitarian aspect of the existing problems would be most effective way to create the favorable climate necessary for meaningful progress. Therefore we welcome the recent efforts designed to diminish inter-Korean tensions.Central America remains under the influence of regional tensions and armed conflicts despite the efforts of the Contadora Group. Strained political relations  combined with persistent economic and social problems  adversely affect the search for peace and stability in the region. The climate of confrontation  extending beyond the area  has made an unfavorable impact on international relations. We hope the process initiated by the Contadora Group will maintain its momentum and will continue to enjoy the genuine political support of all the interested parties.Consistent with our basic approach of settling international disputes through negotiations  we support the good offices mission of the United Nations Secretary-General on the question of Cyprus. We regret  however  that a historic opportunity was missed at the summit meeting of 17 January 1985 because of the intransigence of the Greek Cypriot side. It should also be underlined that a serious obstacle to the solution of the Cyprus problem is the basic attitude of Greece  which rejects the agreed premises on which the talks between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots are proceeding.In respect of the trends and prospects of the world economy  the overall results of the last few years require a comprehensive reassessment. The world economy is expanding after the longest and most serious recession since the end of the Second World War. However  this expansion is limited in scope and magnitude. Indeed it shows wide disparities from country to country. While growth has been quite rapid in some economies  it has been weak or negligible in others. In this context  the situation in many of the developing countries calls for immediate attention  as they are still facing acute economic problems which seriously hinder their prospects for the future. The current international economic situation also remains at risk  particularly because of unresolved questions related to structural adjustment  international trade  money and finance.Most of the developing countries have been forced to cut their imports drastically because of the insufficient inflow of foreign currency. This situation may lead them into further impoverishment with serious social  humanitarian and political consequences.Among developing countries  those who manage to increase their productivity and export capabilities are facing severe trade barriers and import restrictions from the industrialized countries. This situation leads in most cases to difficulties in debt servicing  and further cuts in imports and investments.This makes all the more urgent the need for a new impetus to the North-South dialog  one of the most important tasks facing the international community. So far the efforts aimed at the establishment of a new international economic order have not lived up to our expectations. All countries have an important role to play in this regard. The efforts of the developing nations are not enough by themselves to produce the desired results. The recent experience of some developing countries which have implemented tight adjustment measures shows us that these efforts are bound to be insufficient if the conditions in the external environment continue to exert a negative influence.In this connection  my country's experience may have some relevance. The success of the steps which we have taken since 1980  and their increasing momentum during the last two years  have been the result of our determination in implementing an effective adjustment program. However  the protectionist policies followed by the industrialized countries create major obstacles which frustrate our efforts.Indeed  it is of particular importance to reverse the growing protectionist tendencies. Unless the developed countries clearly demonstrate a determination to take the lead in a process directed towards the relaxation and dismantling of restrictive trade measures  the developing countries will continue to face grave difficulties in successfully carrying out export-oriented growth strategies. On the other hand  it is also in the interest of developed countries to stop protectionist practices  since such practices have a restrictive impact on the overall level of their economic activities and divert them to lower productivity areas.In the monetary and financial fields  appropriate national budgetary and monetary policies are necessary but not enough. International efforts are also required to find a solution to the debt problem and to improve conditions for increasing financial flows to developing countries.We must also not overlook the human dimension of economic development. The round table discussion organized last month in Istanbul under the joint sponsorship of the United Nations Development Program and the North-South round table provided an opportunity for an overall assessment of this important subject.As indicated in its concluding Istanbul Statement:""recent national and international pressures lead to serious neglect of the human dimension in development. Unless remedied  this neglect will distort . and handicap the future development of at least a generation to come."" The situation the world faces is not an optimistic one. Yet we believe that with common determination we can work out a more peaceful and prosperous future and we may overcome many difficulties confronting us.We should all try to replace confrontation with conciliation and understanding  tension with dialog  restrictive economic measures with a global and more responsible approach to the economic problems of the world. We cannot let poverty and hunger prevail. The collective wisdom of the international community should not permit those problems to fester. We owe it not only to this generation but also to the generations to come."
"125",7052,"TZA",40,1985,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly during this fortieth anniversary session of our Organization. I offer my very best wishes for a session which  as we all hope  will  under your leadership  contribute substantially to world peace and justice.Tanzania attaches very great importance to the United Nations and to our membership of this Organization. As we have always understood it  the United Nations was created as a result  and also became an expression  of the spirit of internationalism engendered by the lessons of the 1939-1945 war  and of the economic misery and instability which had preceded it; for the establishment of the United Nations and its institutions was inspired by a recognition that peace and war  poverty and instability were world issues requiring the co-operation of all peoples and all nations. The United Nations and its agencies were thus based on the philosophy that all nations had equal rights and duties  although there were reservations as regards the Security Council and some of the specialized agencies.In an important sense the United Nations grew more truly internationalist during its first 25 years. For the underlying internationalism which then dflQioated world politics -act together with economic facts and the irresistible demands of colonial peoples for freedom and justice - had the result of gradually increasing the membership of this Organization. From a membership of 50 nations in 1945  we have grown to 159. This Assembly is now really representative of the world.As such  the General Assembly does in practice have the ""automatic majority"" which its detractors sometimes complain about. Its majority is composed of representatives of nations which are poor and underdeveloped - and mostly members of the Non-Aligned Movement.The effect on this body is similar to that within a parliament when votes are extended to more and more citizens until there is adult suffrage. The interests of the majority - the poorer or less-educated citizens - then have to be taken into account by an elected Government unless it embarks upon an authoritarian policy of systematic repression. The General Assembly has become the world forum - the only world forum - where the poor and underdeveloped can contribute their ideas and express their interests; where  in other words  some element of the philosophy of democracy finds expression internationally. A change in the structure of the General Assembly would thus be an attack both on internationalism and on the validity of the very idea of the legal equality of nations.For that majority is not effective in the Security Council  where the permanent membership and veto power of five United Nations Members was  from the beginning  a concession to the reality of military and economic power - that is  to the power balance which existed in 1945. Put more kindly  the veto was a recognition of the special responsibilities for upholding peace which inevitably fall upon the strong if peace is to prevail in the world. Whether the permanent membership does in fact in all cases still represent the reality of world power centers is highly questionable; but that is not a matter about which I intend to speak today.But  in any case  as the Secretary-General again points out in his extremely admirable report to the United Nations this year  the United Nations is not a world Government. No nation has  by joining it  surrendered any of its sovereignty.The ability of the United Nations to carry out the internationalist purposes for which it was established therefore depends primarily upon the attitudes and policies of its Member States  and particularly upon those of the veto Powers. And Tanzania is becoming very concerned about the decreasing internationalism in the attitudes and policies of some very powerful Members of our Organization  and the consequent weakening of the whole United Nations system.Perhaps the most blatant example - and I can only give a few of many examples - of international authoritarianism is the growing practice of threatening adverse consequences to small nations which use their United Nations votes in a manner displeasing to a strong Power. We know from experience that this has been happening privately for some time. But now even the sense of propriety has gone; small and poor countries are being publicly threatened that they will be punished if they do not vote in accordance with the wishes of a Member of this Organization.What are we supposed to do when the super-Powers vote against our interests? Twenty-eight resolutions on matters of great importance to Tanzania were considered in the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. They were mostly concerned with African or colonial questions and the law of the sea. One was passed by consensus; the United States of America voted against 17 of them and abstained on 10. Are we then expected to regard that United Nations Member as an enemy? Or are we to accept its assurances that its disagreement is the result of its own judgment on the issues and does not indicate any lack of friendship towards us? And if - as we have until now done - we are to do the latter  what exempts the big Powers from the same obligation?For nations as for individuals  poverty is itself degrading enough. Do we have to add to it  by attempts to exploit the fact of poverty to deprive the weak and the poor of the only thing which they have - their human dignity and self-respect?I am mindful of the Secretary-General's appeal to us to avoid divisive rhetoric in this Assembly. But I must reassert the right of all united Nations Members to speak and to vote in accordance with their own judgment  albeit that the judgment of all of us is affected by our own interests. TO belittle that right is to threaten the whole structure of international co-operation; it is derogatory to the dignity of the United Nations  and of our separate States.We were colonies once; we are no longer colonies. And  speaking for Tanzania  we refuse to become a neo-colony of any country under the sun. We third-world countries did not win our independence - in Tanzania's case  with the help of the United Nations system - in order to sell it to the highest bidder  nor even to buy off trouble by voting in the General Assembly at the behest of a veto Power. We will use the only right our weakness leaves to us - the right to scream a protest at international authoritarianism and bullying.My second example of international authoritarianism relates directly to the future existence of humanity. Matters related to nuclear weapons and their testing  above all other subjects  should be discussed and settled on the basis of the common interest of all peoples.The partial test ban Treaty of 1963 represented an advance for internationalist). Since then there has just been the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970. It is highly questionable whether it has stopped any non-nuclear Power - a signatory or otherwise - from developing a nuclear weapons capacity if it would otherwise have done so; it has certainly not stopped a continued and massive growth in the number  the size and the variety of nuclear weapons in the hands of the five nuclear Powers.On the contrary  now we even have the Strategic Defense Initiative - the threat to take nuclear and laser beam war into space. This matter is not even brought to the United Nations or any other world organization for discussion. Yet space belongs to all of us - if it can belong to anyone.Some of us did feel encouraged by the Soviet Union's announcement of a moratorium on nuclear testing. The stated period was short  but the action itself represented a challenge for peace instead of for war. Yet the response of the other super-Power was to say that this was mere propaganda  and the Soviet Union could watch That Power's own forthcoming nuclear tests. If it was propaganda  surely the answer for anyone who cares about peace is more effective propaganda. Let the United States challenge the Soviet Union to accept a much longer moratorium. What is the use of watching nuclear tests? what humanity needs is an end to all nuclear-weapon testing everywhere.If all tests stop  the development of new weapons becomes much more difficult. Weapons which may not work  or which may blow up those using them  are less attractive to any army  air force or navy. A comprehensive test ban would thus at least slow down the arms race and provide time for the negotiation and organization of nuclear disarmament. It is possible that verification of adherence to such a treaty may not yet be 100 per cent perfect  but modern technology could certainly monitor nuclear explosions very much smaller than the ones which devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Let us do what can be done  and create an incentive to perfect the instruments of verification.Movement in that direction would transform the present international climate of mutual suspicion and hostility. Even now I appeal for a new start. I join with other United Nations Members in urging that the planned meeting of the super-Power leaders should provide real and joint leadership for peace in accordance with the original aims of the United Nations.I now turn to southern Africa. In 1978  after long negotiations. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) was adopted with the active support of the Western bloc nations  without any dissenting votes. It laid down the basis for a peaceful transition to the independence of Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations. Despite quite heroic efforts by the Secretary-General  that resolution has not been implemented. On the contrary  since 1981 it has been effectively blocked by the policy of linking Naraibian independence with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. This policy of ""linkage"" was initiated  and is still backed by the United States of America.Angola has very hard to find some formula which would uphold its right to defend itself against attack with the aid of allies chosen by itself  and which would at the same time avoid political embarrassment for the current American administration. The only effective result has been renewed attacks on Angola by South Africa - which in fact never withdrew all its troops from that country - and a renewed threat by the United States to support dissidents trying to overthrow the Government of Angola.Thus  once again  we have a veto Power acting in such a way as to undermine the United Nations - and in this case even on a decision which it took an active part in promoting. As a result  South Africa remains in Namibia  attacks Angola and other neighbors with impunity  and is able to mock the verbal condemnation with which it is assailed.For all of us verbally condemn the apartheid system which is at the root of South Africa's refusal to end its occupation of Namibia and of its attacks on its other neighbors. But we have not been able to use the machinery available in the Charter to deal with this atrocity and its danger to world peace. This despite the fact that apartheid in South Africa is based on the same doctrines of racial superiority as nazism  which the authors of apartheid supported. Even the violence against the people of South Africa during the last 18 months has led only to a Security Council resolution - adopted with some notable abstentions but at least no veto - encouraging nations to take unilateral actions against South Africa.Surely no one can be happy at the situation in South Africa now - neither the allies of the apartheid state nor its enemies. There is too much suffering and too much chaos. The temptation to powerful nations to see their own interests as being involved and thus to spread the conflagration is increasing too fast.For the people of South Africa have protested against apartheid  have demonstrated  been arrested  tortured and died  year after year. And despite a few incidents of sabotage  the intensified struggle is still basically that of an unarmed people rejecting apartheid angrily and courageously. They are rejecting it with their blood  fighting bullets with stones and the sheer force of numbers. They no longer seem to care about dying. And they are no longer interested in concessions or reforms announced by a white Government. So apartheid is clearly doomed  and the longer it takes to come to an end  the greater will be the misery and the more devastating the chaos.The United Nations must act now. It is essential that concerted international action should help the local people bring down apartheid quickly. The time for mere warnings has passed.Mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter is the minimum action required of this Organization. They are merited on three counts: first  South Africa's defiance of the United Nations over Namibia? secondly  its constant and continuing direct and indirect attacks on its independent neighbors  thirdly  the indignity  the slavery  the violence and the dangers to world peace which are inherent in its policy of organized racism - a crime against humanity.The problems of southern Africa have developed to their present dangerous condition because there has been a failure to act internationally at an early stage. But in the sphere of international economics there has been a clear regression from the internationalism which created the United Nations.By 1945 it appeared that the world had learned the economic lessons of the 1920s and 1930s. It was thus for hard-headed reasons  as well as renewed feelings of human solidarity  that the Bretton Woods institutions and other United Nations specialized agencies were created to work with and alongside the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.The declared purpose of the entire system was the well-being and prosperity of all nations  based on increased international co-operation and trade  and a reduction of poverty  ignorance and disease throughout the globe. Inevitably  the institutions were not always well-targeted  sufficient in scope  or sufficiently adaptable for the tasks given to them  but they were there  to be improved and extended according to experience.And the system was extended  with the International Development Association (IDA)  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Development program (UNDP) being created during the 1960s  and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) as late as 1977. As another reflection of internationalism  in 1960 the General Assembly adopted a target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to be allocated by the richer and more developed Members to the war against world poverty. Not all nations committed themselves to this target; indeed  quite spurious reasons were advanced by some nations for not doing so. But the majority of the developed nations did accept that target.Unfortunately  a new orthodoxy  backed up by economic power  has in the last five or six years increasingly ignored the fact that the world's current economic problems arise from rapid technological advance  and the inadequacy and asymmetry of the international structures previously established. So instead of further international co-operation  and an intensified attack on the problems of poverty  we have a return to the monetarism and the economic nationalist insularity of the 1920s and 1930s.Attempts were made  and work was even begun  on dealing with the increasingly obvious world economic problems through international negotiation. In 1974  the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Establishment of a NewInternational Economic Order. At the thirty-fourth session in 1979  the Assembly decided to launch global and sustained negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  with the first report of the Committee of the Whole to be submitted to the 1980 special session.By then attitudes had changed. We had that special session; it achieved nothing  not even agreement on procedures  a time-frame  or even an agenda. Then in 1981  we had the Cancun meeting in Mexico  designed  in the wake of the Brandt Commission report  to search out a basis for negotiations. The Cancun meeting achieved nothing. And since then it has proved impossible even to get talks about talks about global negotiations. The major developed countries  led by the United States  have blocked all progress. They are not even willing to consider the facts of poverty and its interrelationship with the present international economic system; world poverty has been pushed off the international agenda.Instead  we see the new anti-internationalist climate reflected in the actions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This institution is now little more than an instrument used by the wealthiest and most powerful nations for the international enforcement of their own economic policies on the under-developed countries of the world.The attempt to use the World Bank system in the same way has not had complete success  although sane Member States have been denied access to its funds for what can only be described as ideological reasons. But we have seen a decreasing allocation of funds for the International Development Association (IDA). Not only has the total amount of official development assistance dropped as a percentage of nations' gross national product; the aid which is being given is increasingly allocated bilaterally  so that it can more easily be used for the political purposes of the donors.In the light of these developments  it is not surprising that the international financial system is again threatened with collapse as a result of the immense - and now frequently unpayable - debts of under-developed countries. But still the problem is not being dealt with co-operatively and internationally. Instead  creditors as a group insist upon dealing with each debtor individually  and squeezing the maximum amount from it regardless of the health of its people  or its stability and future development. Simultaneously  the developed countries increasingly take refuge from their own problems in some form of protectionism  thus making it ever more difficult for debtors to earn the foreign exchange with which to meet their revised commitments.There are  however  some nations whose debts are so large that they could on their own jeopardize the international banking system. These countries have the power of their own debt with which to protect themselves - if they are politically strong enough to withstand the combined economic and political pressures of their creditors and the IMF. But no African country is in that position  although Africa's debts are larger as a proportion of its national income than those of any other are. Consequently we have the ludicrous position that billions of dollars are exported from Africa in servicing high-interest debts  billions more are exported from Africa  lost through a deterioration of the terms of trade of primary commodity exporters  and African States beg for food to prevent their people from starving!Africa has called for an international conference to deal with its debt problem. So far the response has not been very encouraging. That request runs counter to the strong movement away from internationalism.We see the same attitudes being applied to those United Nations specialized agencies which have a governing structure based on the equality of nations.Nations withdraw from the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) because they do not like some of its decisions. They downgrade their representation at UNCTAD and UNIDO conferences. The financing of IFAD cannot be agreed despite all the lectures read to impoverished Africa about the importance of agriculture and the small farmer.All the world's Governments know - or ought to know - where the doctrine ""might is right"" can lead humanity. The unity and indivisibility of the world has now been seen from space. It is experienced by all nations and all peoples  even those who do not understand it. The only solution to the world's problems is international co-operation  with its recognition of our common humanity and interdependence.I make this appeal: for our common benefit  and the benefit of each one of us  let us act towards each other with humility  not arrogance  recognizing that none of us knows all the answers to the manifold problems facing us. Let us resume our earlier course - the course we began to follow 40 years ago when the United Nations was established - and together search out a path to justice and prosperity for all. It will be difficult  and we shall argue a lot. But it can be done if we respect each other and each other's freedom.In this  ray last address to the General Assembly  I have described events and trends and needs as we in Tanzania perceive them. My country will not stop saying those things when the new President takes over. For we are a poor and underdeveloped country  and we have no power in the world except the power of speech given by the Assembly - and by our humanity. To be silent when we see danger  to refrain from attacking policies which we see as contrary to the interests of peace and justice  would be to surrender our freedom and our dignity. That we shall never do."
"126",7097,"UGA",40,1985,"I wish to extend to you  Sir  my delegation's sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this historic session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation shares fully the warm sentiments expressed so eloquently by previous speakers on your personal qualities which make you eminently qualified for the task entrusted to you. I have no doubt whatsoever that under your able leadership the deliberations of this commemorativesession  marking the 40th anniversary oft the United Nations  will be very fruitful  In this connection* X wish to pledge the full support and co-operation of say delegation to you in the discharge of your enormous task.I wish to take this opportunity to register my profound appreciation for the wise and able leadership demonstrated by your predecessor  Ambassador Paul Lusaka  throughout the 39th session of the General Assembly.Permit Me also to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts in the search for solutions to the numerous world problems. X wish to commend  in particular  his efforts in mobilizing relief assistance for famine stricken areas of Africa and his attempts to find solutions to the problems of southern Africa.The world has witnessed in the past year a dangerously deteriorating situation in southern Africa caused by south Africa's increasingly aggressive posture towards its neighbors and a heightened degree of oppression and intimidation directed against the black majority in that country.The unprovoked murderous attack on Gaborone  leaving more than a dozen dead and a considerably amount of property destroyed  the unprovoked invasion of Angola  the continued support of rebel forces in Mozambique in spite of the Nkomati accord  the failed mission to blow up the Malongo oil complex in the Cabinda Province of Angola  and the recent air raid in support of UNITA  are viewed by my Government as a deliberate policy on the part of South Africa to destabilize its neighbors in a desperate attempt to delay the forces of change for as long as possible.In South Africa itself  the volcano of discontent  which has been rumbling for a long time  is finally erupting. No amount of repressive measures can stem the tide of the march to equality and freedom in South Africa.The imposition of a state of emergency; the imprisonment  detention and banning of black leaders  the indiscriminate murder of blacks in funeral processions  and the arrest of eight-year-old school children protesting inferior education  may delay but will certainly not stop the move to dismantle apartheid.The time for cosmetic reforms short of the complete dismantling of apartheid has long past. We urge the Pretoria regime  in the interest of all racial groups in that country  to abandon repressive measures and to initiate meaningful dialog with all genuine leaders of the black community. As a first step in this direction  the South African authorities should free all political leaders  including Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Allan Boesak  unconditionally.On the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on Decolonization  we are faced with a stalemate on the question of Namibia'sindependence. The Pretoria regime continues to frustrate all efforts to bring about an end to its illegal occupation of Namibia. The setting up of the so-called ""interim administration"" in Namibia by South Africa is yet another plot designed to perpetuate the status quo.The international community is duty bound to address itself seriously to this stubborn defiance by the apartheid regime. In this connection  my Government fully supports the demand made by the Security Council  earlier this year  for the immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as the only acceptable basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem. I wish also to reiterate Uganda's total rejection of all attempts to make Namibia's independence contingent upon factors that are extraneous and irrelevant.Until South Africa takes the necessary steps for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  Uganda will continue to support the call for the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In this connection  it is gratifying to note that several countries have taken heed of the Security Council's call to those Member States which had not done so already to take certain voluntary economic measures against South Africa.Uganda has noted with particular satisfaction the limited economic measures announced by several Member states against South Africa in recent months. We would like to encourage them to move even further towards mandatory sanctions as the quickest and less painful means of bringing about change in South Africa. We would also like to appeal to those Member States which wield considerable economic clout in South Africa and which have yet to introduce voluntary economic measures against South Africa  to review positively their stand on the question of economic sanctions.We realize that because of their considerable investments in the South African economy the sacrifice of these countries resulting from the imposition of mandatory sanctions would be greater than that of other Member nations. However  the danger posed to these same interests by the violent revolution that is unfolding in South Africa has to be taken into account. It is perhaps the perception of this fact that has led to contacts between the African National Congress (ANC) and leading South African businessmen.The view that economic sanctions do not work is not shared by my delegation. It is clear that the limited measures taken or threatened to be taken by some countries which hitherto have been strong supporters of South Africa  have already had a greater impact on the apartheid regime than the policy of ""constructive engagement""  which has strengthened  rather than weakened  apartheid.The majority of blacks in South Africa support the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions  even though they realize that they would probably be the worst affected. They know that this sacrifice is no greater than the supreme sacrifice paid by hundreds of their brothers and sisters gunned down in the streets or murdered in detention. The front-line States have also indicated their strong . support for mandatory sanctions despite the fact that they too are likely to be adversely affected.My delegation has noted with deep concern the escalation of the arms race  particularly since the advent of the ""Star Wars"" concept. We are opposed to the militarization of outer space. It is regrettable to note that despite the convening of two special emergency sessions of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament  the manufacture and stockpiling of new and more sophisticated nuclear weapons continues at an alarming pace.I wish to reiterate my delegation's conviction that international peace andsecurity can be maintained only through general and complete disarmament  and in particular nuclear disarmament  under effective international control. In this connection  Uganda supports fully the initiative taken by the six Heads of State or Government who called upon all nuclear-weapon States to freeze the testing  production and deployment of nuclear weapons as a first step to be followed by an armaments reduction program leading to general and complete disarmament in their Joint Declaration of 22 May 1984.It is a sad reflection on our values that we should be prepared to spend billions of dollars annually on the refinement of our destructive capabilities instead of directing these resources to the solution of the world's economic  social and humanitarian problems.The situation in the Middle Bast remains troubled because of the lack of any progress towards a just and comprehensive settlement of the question of Palestine. It was with great distress and indignation that my delegation learned of the bombing raid staged on 1 October by Israel against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLC) headquarters in Tunisia. We are all aware of the fact that the question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East problem and the root cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict.The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  which was held in Geneva in 1983  recommended the convening of an international peace conference with the participation of all concerned parties  including the PLO and the two super-Powers. My delegation supports this move because it believes strongly that a negotiated peace that recognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination in an independent State of Palestine  as well as respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of all States in the region  offers the best hope for all concerned in that part of the world. We urge all concerned to work tirelessly for the convening of the peace conference.With regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict  Uganda  as a fellow member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement  urges both parties to end this terrible conflict  which has cost both countries so dear in terms of both lives lost and property destroyed. It is time for both countries to respond positively to the many appeals and many mediation efforts that have been directed to them.Uganda continues to follow developments in Cyprus  a fellow Commonwealth member  with keen interest. We will continue to support and encourage the Government and people of Cyprus in their search for a lasting solution on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. In this connection we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in mediating between the two communities.With regard to the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  we urge all the parties concerned to seek comprehensive political solutions  which should provide for the withdrawal of foreign forces and ensure respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of both countries. We will continue to render our support to all efforts intended to achieve this goal.Uganda calls for effective measures to end all forms of foreign interference in Central America. We fully support the Contadora Group in its efforts to find a peaceful solution for the region  as contained in the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  of 7 September 1984. The Act represents an important step towards lasting peace and the promotion of economic and social development in the region. We appeal to the five Governments; of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua  to do all in their power to conclude negotiations with the Contadora Group with a view to signing the Act as early as possible.Permit me now to brief this Assembly on the present situation.in Uganda. Today Uganda celebrates the twenty-third anniversary of its independence. Regrettably  for more than half of its independent existence Uganda has known nothing but civil conflict  with its attendant consequences of lawlessness  political instability  economic decline and moral decay.Uganda  once described by one of the greatest of statesmen  Sir Winston Churchill  as the pearl of Africa  started out on its independence road with great promise and high hopes. During the first few years of its independence Uganda experienced rapid development in all fields  particularly in the social sector  unfortunately that rapid development and progress suffered greatly owing to political instability  which culminated in the military coup staged by Idi Amin. The 1971 military coup brought development and any progress to a complete halt.The world does not need reminding how brutal and chaotic Amin's dictatorship was. Suffice it to say that the consequences for Uganda were ruinous. The fall of Amin in 1979 presented the people of Uganda with a golden opportunity to make a fresh start along the road to reconciliation  peace  unity and development. Regrettably  this opportunity was allowed to slip through our hands. Amin's fall was followed by three short-lived administrations in the space of less than two years.Following the general elections of December 1980  the validity of whose results were greatly disputed  the new Obote administration was faced with another civil conflict. Some Ugandans who disputed the fairness and validity of the election results decided to go to the bush to conduct a guerrilla war against Obote's Government. This war has been extremely costly to Uganda in terms of lives lost  property destroyed and development opportunities lost.On numerous occasions Dr. Hilton Obote was urged by prominent personalities both at home and abroad to enter into dialog with the various groups fighting his administration in order to save Uganda from further bloodshed and suffering. He stubbornly refused to heed this advice. This stubborn refusal ran counter to his stated policy of reconciliation and no revenge as the basis for reunifying Uganda and its people.This  then  was the backdrop to the Military coup d'etat which took place in Uganda on 27 July 1985. Explaining the reasons for the action taken by the army. General Tito Okello Lutwa  Chairman of the ruling Military Council and Head of State  said:""For many years now our country has suffered continuously from a process of political and moral decay and the abuse of power by the authorities of the day. Corruption has been widespread. The human rights guaranteed by the Constitution have frequently been violated. Tribalism  conflicts and indiscipline have been widespread in all sectors of national life. These ills were killing the country slowly. The action taken by the men of the UNLA on Saturday  27 July 1985  was therefore aimed at stopping this dangerous trend and restoring peace and order in Uganda."" He went on to emphasize that""The fighting which has been going on in some parts of the country for the last five years has caused too much suffering to the people of Uganda. It has been a hemorrhage draining the life and energy of the nation. The stopping of all fighting and the establishment of peace in the country therefore constitutes a high priority for the Military Council.""From the foregoing it is quite clear that the new Government's domestic and foreign policies will be dominated by a genuine desire on the part of the Government for lasting peace and tranquility in Uganda in particular and in ourregion  as a whole. It is for this reason that  right item the outset  the Government has set as its top-priority task the ending of all fighting in the country. To this end the Military Council has vigorously pursued negotiations with all the groups which were fighting Obote's Government .I wish to report that the negotiations have been successfully concluded with all fighting groups with the exception of the National Resistance Army  led by Yoweri Museveni. These groups are now participating fully in the governing of the country through their membership of the Military Council.However  negotiations with the National Resistance Army are progressing well under the wise and title chairmanship of His Excellency President Daniel Arap Hoi of Kenya  who has graciously set aside his important State duties in order to assist us in our search for peace.There is need for a genuine and comprehensive process of political reconciliation in our country. Our recent history tea dies us that no single group  whether political  religious or tribal  can succeed alone in bringing peace and tranquility to Uganda. It is for this reason that the Military Council has decided to involve all political groups in the formation of a new Government of national unity. He believe that all groups should participate fully in the affairs of the country.The Chairman of the Military Council has urged all political groups to use this opportunity positively for the benefit of the entire country. He has warned them not to resort to their old methods of scheming for power and manipulating the people of Uganda.It is the policy of the Government to ensure that there is no revenge against and no victimization of anybody. Members of the previous Government are free; relatives and friends of those who were in power are free} those who wanted to join their family members who have left the country have been allowed to do so  and they will not be harassed or victimized in any way. Only persons with criminal charges against them are in detention.As a result of the conflicts which have been going on within the country for the last several years  there are many refugees outside the country as well as displaced people within the country. It is the policy of the Government to move as rapidly as possible to resettle the refugees and displaced persons. Already many refugees are pouring into Uganda through the districts of Arua from the neighboring countries of Zaire and Sudan. The Government will spare no efforts to assist these people to resettle in the country  similarly the Government will work very hard to ensure that the people who were displaced within the country as a result of the fighting  especially those in the Luwero triangle  will be given all assistance in resettling on their land and in their homes.The people of Uganda are tired of living in conditions of fear and insecurity. The establishment of security  law and order throughout the country is a top priority for the Government. We are committed to bringing to book criminal elements that kill innocent citizens  destroy properties and loot houses and business premises. We shall work to make the police a more effective and efficient force. We need the co-operation and goodwill of all citizens and all peace-loving countries to make possible the re-establishment of law and order throughout the country.We are aware of the serious economic hardships being experienced by Ugandans throughout the country. We realize these are difficult problems to solve. Their solutions require correct policies as well as discipline in all sectors of national life. The Government is undertaking an urgent review of the state of the economy in order to put in place policies that will ensure economic recovery.Allow me to outline briefly the Uganda Government's proposals for the peace talks now taking place in Nairobi. The Government has proposed  first  a call for an immediate and effective cease-fire to be observed by all parties. Secondly  all parties are to stop recruitment  mobilization and deployment of forces immediately on reaching agreement; all acquisition of arms should also end. Thirdly  the Military Council has offered six seats on the Council to the National Resistance Army. Fourthly  the Military Council has called for complete disarmament in Uganda as a prerequisite for genuine and lasting peace in Uganda. This would involve disarming all the forces in the country  including the Government forces  under the supervision of a peace-keeping force drawn from friendly countries. Fifthly  the Military Council has called for the creation of a new broadly based and representative national army. Sixthly  it has proposed the convening of a national conference to discuss key national issues  which include a viable constitution for the country; and a program for free and fair elections to be held soon after. The national conference will represent a wide cross-section of all organizations in Uganda.I wish to take this opportunity to clarify one important point which may have caused alarm and disquiet in some quarters. This is with regard to the reports that ""Arain's soldiers"" have returned to Uganda. The Chairman and Head of State has been very clear on this subject. He has called on all Ugandans living in exile to return home in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness so that we can all participate effectively in the reconstruction of our nation. Following the liberation war in 1979 many people in the West Nile region of Uganda  including some soldiers who served under Amin  fled into exile. They later regrouped and started a guerrilla war against Obote's Government. Some of these groups have returned  and they constitute some of the fighting groups with which the Military Council has concluded peace agreements. These people who have been allowed to return are Ugandans mostly om the West Nile region of Uganda. The Government has also made it abundantly clear that any Ugandan  irrespective of which fighting group he belongs to  who is known to have committed acts of atrocity or broken the law in any way will face the due process of the law.The past year has been a very difficult one for Africa. Many countries on the continent have suffered from natural disasters of frightening proportions. Prolonged drought together with accelerated desertification in several countries  particularly in Ethiopia and Sudan  has led to considerable loss of life and displacement of populations. This serious situation has been compounded by the continued deterioration of the economies of African States. These economies are being suffocated by the crippling burden of debt servicing  the dwindling incomes from primary commodity exports  the high interest rates and declining development assistance.We believe that the task of revitalizing our economies lies squarely with ourselves. It is in recognition of this fact that the African Heads of State or Government meeting in Addis Ababa in July resolved to address themselves boldly to the root causes of our economic malaise. They adopted a package of measures intended to achieve self-reliant and self-sustained development at the national and continental levels. He are well aware that these noble goals may be beyond our reach  given the present state of depression  without substantial external assistance.He are convinced that Africa's economic problems differ from those of other regions only in the degree of their severity. Their solution  therefore  cannot be tackled in isolation. It is to ray delegation a source of great disappointment to note that the initiatives taken by the developing countries to redress the structural imbalance and inequalities of the present global economic system have been resisted by a few developed countries. We appeal to these countries to refrain from adopting retrogressive policies which run counter to the goals and objectives of the international development strategy for the third united Nations Development Decade and which frustrate the establishment of the new international economic order.We in Uganda are most appreciative of the response of the internationalcommunity to the drought and famine crisis in Africa. We hope  however  that it will be possible for the donor countries to move a stage further from the supply of food aid to the provision of long-term assistance geared to the general improvement of food production within the African continent.On behalf of the Government and the people of Uganda  I wish to reaffirm our firm support for the purposes and principles of the United Nations and the efforts the Organization is making to maintain world peace and security and to promote international co-operation in the economic and social fields. It is my firm conviction that the salvation of the human race lies in our collective effort to create a more stable  equitable world based on humane values and an awareness that after all we are all part of a large universe about which we know so little."
"127",7142,"UKR",40,1985,"Mr. President  please accept our warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and to wish you every success in this responsible work.We wish also to pay due tribute to Ambassador Paul Lusaka for the skilful and qualified way in which he led the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR would like to express its deep condolences to the people and the Government of Mexico over the very heavy earthquakes that have caused much loss of life and much destruction in that country.As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  it is quite appropriate to look back at the path traversed by the Organization  to try to appraise its achievements and to consider what it has to do in the future and how its effectiveness can be enhanced.Th<> United Nations was created during and immediately after the greatest battle of peoples to save civilization from Fascist barbarity. From the extremely trying times of the Second World War  in which the Ukrainian SSR alone suffered the loss of one-sixth of its population  emerged the idea of uniting peoples for peace. The States of the anti-Hitlerite coalition  which called themselves the United Nations  joined together in the pursuit of the most humane possible goal  namely  ""to save a succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". They have enshrined this goal in the Charter of their Organization.We wish to pay tribute to the founders of the United Nations and its Charter  who devised the fundamental principles and mechanisms of international relations  which even today  after forty years  in this new nuclear and space age  have forfeited none of their importance. The United Nations Charter  which calls upon all countries ""to live together in peace as good neighbors""  reflects the concept of peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems. This document lays down the just and democratic principles of the non-use of force  sovereign equality  freedom and self-determination of peoples  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion. This is  in effect  a concise description of the better world which our Organization is striving to achieve.We believe that mobilizing the efforts of all countries for the solution of the key problem of our time  that of preventing thermonuclear war and preserving life on Earth  would be a fitting tribute to the Organization's fortieth anniversary. The solution of all other urgent problems and the very survival of human civilization depend on whether the world can avoid a nuclear catastrophe.The fortieth session of the General Assembly is taking place against the backdrop of a sharp deterioration in the international situation caused by the actions of imperialist forces. The United States  with the support of its closest North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies  is continuing to whip up the arms race  and is pursuing a course aimed at achieving military superiority and blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign States. The plans of the United States Administration and its military-industrial complex  designed to turn outer space into an arena of military rivalry  pose a special danger.In the NATO camp  and above all in the Federal Republic of Germany  revanchist forces  trying to cast doubt on the results of the Second World War and the post-war structure  have become more active. They are openly and provocatively calling for a return to the frontiers of 1937 and for the creation of some kind of future Europe of the so-called ""free peoples""  in which there is to be no place left for the States of the socialist system. It is not difficult to see where this pernicious road is leading.The key question today is how to halt the arms race  which has assumed global dimensions  how to prevent its spread into outer space and how to make a start on reducing the already existing means of mass annihilation of human beings. The Soviet Union has repeatedly emphasized that in reducing and limiting any type of arms it will go as far as its negotiating partners are prepared to go. The Soviet Union is ready for the most radical measures in order to prevent an arms race in outer space and to end it on Garth. Indeed  instead of inventing so-called ""means of defending"" oneself from nuclear warheads  would it not be better and safer to agree to reduce and then to eliminate altogether the very means of such attack?The socialist countries want an end to be put to the arms race and are calling for a radical solution to the problem of nuclear weapons: their complete prohibition and elimination. I should like to emphasize that this is not a time-serving policy nor is it a propaganda ploy  of which some are often trying to accuse us  but the basic course pursued by the countries of the socialist community in their external policies. A very apt response to critics of this kind was given by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev  who said:""We have ceased nuclear explosions. You Americans could take your revenge by doing likewise. You could deal us yet another propaganda blow  say  by suspending the development of one of your new strategic missiles. And we would respond with the same kind of 'propaganda*. And so on and so forth. Would anyone  I wonder  be harmed by competition in such 'propaganda'?""It is by no means a propaganda effect that we  together with other peoples of the world  expect from the forthcoming meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and of the United States. The time has come to put Soviet-American relations on a normal track  because  after all  the destinies o£ the world and of world civilization depend on relations between these two countries. As has been demonstrated in the general debate at the current session of the General Assembly  all those who adopt an attitude of political realism are ready to contribute to the success of this meeting and are indeed pinning serious hopes on it.In the present tense international situation the initiative of the Soviet Union  which led to the start of the Soviet-American negotiations on nuclear and space arms in Geneva  was  in our view  of particular importance.The Soviet Union  in proposing a dialog to the United states  was guided by a deep sense of responsibility for the cause of world peace. Convincing proof of this is provided by its constructive proposals to declare a moratorium on the development  including research  testing and deployment  of space strike weapons * and a freeze on strategic nuclear weapons. To demonstrate its sincerity and good will the USSR has announced a unilateral cessation until next November of the further deployment of its medium-range weapons and suspension of other counter-measures in Europe. This constructive step has been commended by the world community.If it sincerely wished to reach agreement  the other side would have surely made use of those proposals and actions; but all indications are that the United States does not want this. It is feverishly carrying out a gigantic program of accelerated development of further new types of weapons of mass destruction  it is proceeding with the deployment of first-strike nuclear missiles in Europe in the futile hope of achieving military superiority over the socialist countries and has already begun testing anti-satellite weapons.Washington is  in fact  using the ongoing negotiations as a screen for its aggressive plans. How else can one explain that when the Geneva talks were already under way the United States took a decision to allocate $1.5 billion for the construction of 21 additional MX missiles which were blasphemously called the ""peace-keeper""? It is difficult to trust the assurances given by the United States side that it intends to conduct the dialog in a constructive spirit  given its actions undermining the SALT II Treaty. Moreover  the United States Administration plans to amputate the fundamental provisions of the SALT II Treaty as soon as they become obstacles to its programs for the development and stockpiling of strategic weapons. It is the duty of the General Assembly to appraise such actions and resolutely speak out against any steps which would undermine the existing system of agreements in the field of arms limitation and disarmament.The fact that the United States is seeking not the cessation of the nuclear-arms race but an arms build-up is clearly reflected in the approach of the United States Administration to the issue of the non-militarization of outer space. It is clear even to a layman that one cannot seriously expect progress in the field of nuclear disarmament if in parallel to that the ""star wars"" program is being implemented. Between 1983 and 1993 the United States is planning to spend $70 billion on preparations for ""star wars"". We are profoundly convinced that the realization of these sinister projects would sharply increase the danger of war and disrupt efforts to limit and reduce arms in all areas.Just as the development of nuclear arms did not eliminate conventional weaponsbut spurred on the race in both types of arms  the development of space weaponswill have the same effect: the arms race will further intensify  spread to newfields and assume an uncontrolled and irreversible character. Talk about theallegedly defensive nature of space strike weapons cannot and must not deceiveanyone. The truth is that the United States proposes  with the help of thestrategic defense initiative  to paralyze the Soviet Union's strategic weapons hoping in vain that it would acquire the possibility of making a first nuclearstrike while remaining immune to retaliation.Those officials in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries who believe that Washington's military space plans are directed only against the Soviet Union and its friends and allies are deeply mistaken. Such a position is  to say the least  short-sighted. It ignores the fact that the extension of the arms race to  outer space creates a threat of a global nature  upsetting strategic stability in the world as a whole and affecting the vital interests of the peoples of all countries and continents.A sensible alternative to that fatal course is the new Soviet proposal on international co-operation in the peaceful exploration of outer space in conditions of its non-militarization.It should not be permitted that mankind  standing on the threshold of the space age  should be subjected to a mortal danger from outer space instead of making outer space serve peaceful and creative purposes and bring increasingly tangible benefits for the improvement of life of the inhabitants of that planet. I repeat that the only reasonable choice worthy of the space age can and must be made in favor of preventing the militarization of outer space and reserving it for peaceful activities.The document entitled ""Main Directions and Principles of International Co-operation in the Peaceful Exploration of Outer Space in Conditions of its Non-militarization""  which has been submitted for consideration at this session  stresses that the militarization of outer space would create insurmountable barriers to the development of wide-ranging and equitable international co-operation in the peaceful exploration of outer space for the benefit of the economic and social progress of all peoples and permitting the solution of global problems facing mankind  including those of development  and the elimination of economic backwardness.In order to set in motion the process of interaction among States in conditions of the non-militarization of outer space  it is being proposed that a world space organization should be established with the aim of harmonizing  co-ordinating and uniting the efforts of States in peaceful space activities including assistance in this field to the developing countries  as well as helping to verify compliance with the agreements which have already been concluded or which will be concluded with a view to preventing an arms race in space. After the necessary preparatory work  a representative international conference could be convened  by 1987 at the latest  to consider in its entirety the issue of international co-operation in the peaceful exploration of outer space in conditions of its non-militarization and to agree on the main directions and principles of such co-operation.We also support the proposal of the Polish People's Republic on the desirability of preparing  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General  a study of the harmful consequences of the militarization of outer space.The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR also considers it necessary to address specifically the question of the cessation of all nuclear-weapon tests. The urgent need to solve this problem is evident. It is well known that tests serve to accelerate the nuclear-arms race  in the course of which new  increasingly dangerous kinds and types of weapons of mass destruction are developed and perfected. In 1982 a document was submitted for consideration at the United Nations General Assembly  entitled ""Basic Provisions for a Treaty on the General and Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon Tests"". The overwhelming majority of States supported that proposal. The only dissenting voices were those of the United States and its closest allies - of those on whom its realization actually depends.The United States Administration did not respond to the proposal for introducing  on a mutually agreed date  a moratorium on all nuclear explosions  saying that American nuclear tests would continue because they were necessary for the modernization of the existing nuclear weapons and the production of new ones.In seeking to put an end to the dangerous competition in the build-up of nuclear arsenals  the Soviet Union decided unilaterally to cease all nuclear explosions as of 6 August of this year  the date which is known throughout the world as the day marking the tragedy of Hiroshima. There is no doubt that a mutual moratorium by' the USSR and the United States on all nuclear explosions would be a good example to all other States which possess nuclear weapons.As you know  the Soviet moratorium is to be in effect until 1 January 1986  but it could continue even beyond that date if the United States refrained from setting off nuclear explosions.In addition to other measures in the field of disarmament  it would be of major importance if all nuclear Powers followed the example of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and pledged not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. This step would amount to the elimination of the threat of nuclear war.Following the tests of nuclear weapons and the test of the anti-satellite system ASAT  the United States is embarking on large-scale production of a qualitatively new kind of chemical weapon  the so-called binary weapon. The House-Senate Conference Committee of the united States Congress  under strong pressure from the Administration and the Pentagon  has recommended that $155 million should be earmarked for this purpose in 1936; overall $10 billion is to be spent on the program for producing binary chemical weapons. At Pine Bluff  Arkansas  the first factory  with a productive capacity of 70 000 units of binary munitions  consisting of artillery shells and air bombs  is now ready to go into operation  in accordance with the United States military strategy  binary chemical weapons are intended for offensive operations and are to be used in a first strike situation. Thus  these weapons take on a strategic significance. It is worthy of note that all this is happening while the Geneva Disarmament Conference is engaged in painstaking efforts to draft an international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. Here again  as in other areas of arms limitation  the practical steps taken by the United States Administration are very much at variance with its pronouncements.The United States binary weapons program poses a major military danger  particularly to Europe  since binary weapons - and Washington does not conceal this fact - are to be deployed on the territories of West European countries - the Federal Republic of Germany  the United Kingdom and some others.It is quite clear that  if those plans were to be implemented  Europe would be turned into a potential theater of chemical warfare in which  by the logic of things  the civilian population would become the main victim. Western experts estimate that  in chemical warfare  casualties among civilians are 20 to 30 times higher than military casualties. Western Europe would thus become the Pentagon's dual hostage for both nuclear and chemical warfare.The socialist countries are strongly in favor of ridding Europe of chemical weapons. They put forward a proposal to this effect in 1983. The Ukrainian SSR supports the proposal of the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia  addressed to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany  on establishing a chemical weapon-free-zone in Central Europe.Implementing the socialist countries' proposals on the mutual freezing of military expenditures and their subsequent reduction  and on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations between the countries parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the States members of NATO would be a substantial contribution to curbing the arms race and to achieving disarmamentsIn this connection  we would like once again to emphasize most strongly that a world without wars and weapons  a world of good-neighborliness and co-operation  a world of friendship among nations is the ideal of socialism and the goal of our policy. Precisely for this reason the Ukrainian SSR is in favor of finding radical solutions to the key problems of our time on a fair and equitable basis and in a way which would help us all to move towards the cherished goal of completely eliminating the threat of nuclear war and consolidating the foundations of world peace. We want the forces and energies of people and the genius of mankind to be directed  not at developing new means of destruction  but at eliminating hunger  poverty and disease and at attaining the goals of peaceful development.This year will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security. This date should be an occasion for joint efforts by Member States to find ways to implement the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and to adopt specific collective measures to eliminate conflicts and crisis situations  put an end to acts of aggression and eradicate the vestiges of colonialism. Unfortunately  there remain quite a few so-called hotbeds of tension on our planet.A dangerous source of tension persists in the Middle East. Its causes are well known. It is the aggressive  expansionist policy of Israel. A few days ago Israel carried out yet another alarming act of aggression against Tunisia  grossly flouting all norms of international law. All this is being done with the aid  protection and connivance of the United States  whose aim is to place the Middle East region under its direct military and political control.The interests of peace and international security urgently require that a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement in the Middle East be achieved without delay. Such a settlement can be achieved only through joint efforts with the participation of all the parties concerned. The harmful practice of separate partial deals infringing the legitimate rights of the Arabs  and of the Palestinians in particular  only tends to aggravate the situation in the region.We believe that the best way of putting into effect the well-known principles of a Middle Cast settlement is to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.As a result of Washington's aggressive policies the situation in Central America is becoming more and more grave. There is a growing threat of a direct armed intervention by the united States in Nicaragua  while military and other United States interference in the civil war in El Salvador is expanding and the threats and pressure against Cuba are continuing.The policies of aggression and State-sponsored terrorism conducted by the United States against the countries and peoples of Central America  and in particular against sovereign Nicaragua  are in flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and of the elementary rule of relations among States.The Ukrainian SSR stands solidly behind the just struggle of the Nicaraguan people in their defense of the independence of their country and the achievements of their revolution.We are convinced that the existing problems must and can be settled through negotiations on a mutually acceptable basis  with due regard for the legitimate interests of all countries in the region and with full respect for their sovereignty. A real opportunity for this has been provided by the initiatives of the Government of Nicaragua and the negotiating mechanism for the settlement of the situation in Central America  that is  the Contadora group. Safeguarding the sovereign rights of Nicaragua is of fundamental importance for defending the freedom and independence of all small States.The situation in southern Africa has become particularly grave. Relying on its alliance with the United States and enjoying the support of Israel and some other countries  the racist regime is stepping up its acts of aggression against neighboring African states  primarily against Angola  intensifying terror and repression against the civilian population and anti-apartheid fighters  and continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia  while blocking in every possible way a solution of the Namibian problem.The Ukrainian SSR believes that a decision by the Security Council to impose comprehensive sanctions against South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter should be adopted forthwith. Only such a decisive step can compel the racists to stop their aggressive acts against Angola and other African States  comply with united Nations decisions on the granting of independence to Namibia  and put an end to the shameful system of apartheid.The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples this year should be marked by the adoption of effective measures aimed at the final eradication of the vestiges of colonialism and the elimination of racism and apartheid.The unlawful actions of the United States with respect to Micronesia are clearly contrary to the goals of the Declaration on decolonization. The intention of the United States to legitimize the dismemberment and annexation of thatTerritory and turn it into its strategic military and nuclear staging area poses a threat not only to the people of Micronesia but also to other countries of the region and runs counter to the desire of the States of the Pacific to establish a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. The Ukrainian SSR believes that the United Nations should take all necessary steps in order to prevent the colonial subjugation of Micronesia by the United States of America.As a result of the separatist actions carried out in part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus that is under foreign military occupation  the threat to the existence of Cyprus as an independent States and to its territorial integrity has substantially increased. We favor the withdrawal of foreign troops and the removal of military bases from the island and a just settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions  without outside interference and with due regard for the legitimate interests of both communities. The mission of the Secretary-General  authorized by the Security Council quite recently  aimed at promoting a lasting and just settlement is of major importance in this context.Creating a healthier environment on the Asian continent would be facilitated by the realization of the initiatives calling for an overall comprehensive approach to the problems of security in Asia and a possible concentration of efforts of the Asian States in this direction. Implementation of the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic on concluding a convention on mutual non-aggression and the non-use of force in relations among the States of Asia and the Pacific and the conversion of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace would all contribute to a relaxation of tensions in the region.The Ukrainian SSR expresses its solidarity with the struggle of the Korean People's Democratic Republic for the peaceful reunification of Korea  the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea  and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone on the Korean Peninsula.The Ukrainian SSR supports the constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan paving the way to a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan. We also give our full support to the well-known initiatives of Viet Nam  Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea regarding the normalization of the situation in South-East Asia.The founding States Members of the United Nations which signed its Charter 40 years ago regarded the promotion of economic and social advancement of all nations as one of the primary goals of the Organization. It is indisputable that the United Nations has contributed to resolving this problem. We need only recall that it was within the United Nations that many progressive principles and recommendations have been drawn up contributing to economic decolonization and greater sovereignty of the developing countries over their natural resources and facilitating wide-ranging international co-operation in the trade and economic areas. These principles are reflected in their most concentrated and complete form in such documents as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration and Program Action of Action on the Establishment of the New International Economic Order  which are of key importance for normalizing international relations in this area.The fact that it has still not proved possible to implement those documents is entirely the fault of the developed capitalist countries  which are trying to preserve their dominant position in the system of international economic relations and are not averse to using crude methods of power pressure such as diktat  sanctions and blackmail. They are resorting to unilateral  narrowly self-serving actions that disorganize the entire system of international economic relations and have a particularly harmful impact on the developing countries. The Ukrainian SSR strongly condemns such a course.The program of action proposed by the socialist countries could  in our view  usefully serve the purpose of improving international economic relations ensuring economic security and building confidence in this most important area of relations among States. Enhancing the role of the United Nations and its agencies is one of the organic elements of this program adopted at the summit conference of the countries members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)  held in June 1984. Our delegation will be guided by that approach in the consideration of a broad range of economic issues included in the agenda of the present session.Economic and social progress is possible only if individual rights and freedoms are guaranteed. Achievements of the Ukrainian SSR serve as striking proof of that fact. Formerly a backward appendage of tsarist Russia where foreign capital was predominant and 80 per cent of the population was illiterate  our Republic has achieved in a short historical span of time impressive successes in all spheres of human activity.A guaranteed right to work and to fair remuneration  the society's concern for the individual from birth to old age  flourishing national culture  respect for the dignity and the rights of the individual and active participation of workers in government are all enduring values and organic features of the socialist way of life.The Twenty-Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and theTwenty-Seventh Congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party will be an important stage in accomplishing the grandiose tasks of our further development. To implement our plans we need durable peace. Vladimir Shcherbitsky  Member of the Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party  has emphasized that ""the preservation of peace and  above all  the prevention of nuclear war has become a task of genuinely paramount importance to all mankind"".The Ukrainian SSR intends to work actively with other States Members of the United Nations in order to ensure universal peace and security and develop wide-ranging  mutually beneficial and equitable international co-operation."
"128",7197,"URY",49,1985,"): I feel doubly pleased to be addressing this Assembly on behalf of the people of Uruguay. I am pleased in the first place to see you  Sir  the representative of a people linked to the Uruguayan people by a past of common roots and a present of shared ideals  presiding over this Assembly. Secondly  I. am pleased to be here for the celebration of an anniversary of singular significance: the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.If having existed for four decades is in the case of any human institution a reason for rejoicing  this is even more true in the case of the United Nations  the embodiment of the ideal of the brotherhood of all mankind. Its survival from one day to the next in a world fraught with danger and dominated by national selfishness should be a cause for celebration.In spite of the grave difficulties that it has had to face and the continuous crises that have tested its mettle  this vulnerable ship  which provides a refuge for the hopes of the world  has remained afloat and continued its journey  despite all skepticism  and has succeeded in living twice as long as its predecessor  the League of Nations.In spite of the criticism directed against- the system  the world has lived for almost two generations without conflicts of world-wide scope. That is no mean feat. Currents of solidarity and co-operation which had never before existed in the history of humanity have been generated. A splendid process of decolonization has been launched with the support of the Organization.Having started with 51 countries signatories to the Charter  the Organization today includes 159 independent  sovereign nations.These achievements cannot disguise the weaknesses arising  above all  from the Governments' lack of faith in the Organization and the non-observance of the precepts of the Charter. For this reason  this is a propitious opportunity both to reform and change what must be changed and to undertake a cool analysis to determine which faults are to be attributed to the system as such and which to the flaws and inconsistencies of countries.The Organization  in the last resort  is a reflection of the countries themselves  their faults and their virtues. Its value  moreover  should be measured not only by what it has done but also by what it has prevented  what it has averted - a perspective that highlights the peace-making activities of the United Nations.The San Francisco Charter  although not perfect  seemed at that time adequately to reconcile the transparency of principles with the opacity of reality. But the world has changed and the forces of violence  destruction and discord have renewed their assault. It is true to say that .the United Nations has struggled for peace and justice for 40 years. But does this test of endurance  this persistence in existing despite so much adversity; give us grounds for hope with regard to the future? Do the conditions necessary to allow us to expect that future generations will celebrate a new anniversary of the Organization 40 years hence exist at present?The United Nations has become an indispensable element o£ contemporary international life. We  its Members  who are responsible for its continuing to exist  should insist that a collective effort be made to establish the mechanisms which will allow the Organization to be more effective without substantially altering its legal framework.The United Nations arose out of a cataclysm to replace the League of Nations  which was also the outcome of a tragic world upheaval. Let us not wait for a third cataclysm to improve and strengthen it.In this Assembly Uruguay renews its commitment to continue to support the Organization unconditionally. It is prepared to promote and share in any effort designed to revise the practices and systems of the United Nations to make it more flexible and effective in both the political and the economic spheres and to increase support for the political functions of the Secretary-General.This commitment by Uruguay is  today  backed by the moral and political force that emanates from the existence of its own democratic institutions  recently regained in a peaceful process of institutional normalization firmly rooted in the vote of the people. As the fifth decade of the United Nations begins  the spirit that Uruguay brings to bear in this forum is different from that in the previous decade. We have begun a historic phase of restoration of democracy and democratic reaffirmation in keeping with the deepest convictions of the Uruguayan people. These convictions are rooted in the long-gone era of the struggle for independence  when Uruguayans  in an act of renunciation and loyalty almost without precedent .n history  abandoned their towns  homes and property to follow Artigas  their liberating hero  who never forgot that the only support of his political power lay in the will of the people. The profound symbiosis of the people and their leader  the governed and the governor  is admirably reflected in Artigasis own words: ""My authority emanates from you and ceases in your sovereign presence.""This is the concept of democracy that has remained in the soul of the of the Uruguayan people throughout our history and that now blooms once more as a part of our inner being  as an element of our -identity as a people  as a natural vocation that we can deny only at the risk of losing our way  of going astray  of being other than whom we are. With the democracy which we have now recovered  we have ourselves recovered.As it returns to democracy  Uruguay returns to its traditional position of scrupulous respect for human rights and for the promotion and development of mechanisms and institutions that will ensure the observance and protection of those rights.Because we were a people caught in the middle  between Spain and Portugal  the two great empires  because our Iberian roots were strengthened by a flood of Italian immigrants and later by the migratory currents of French  Swiss  Armenian  Jewish and other peoples  pluralism  tolerance  a belief in freedom and respect for human rights lie deep within the very nature of our being.On the domestic level  no sooner had the new Government assumed power than it declared a generous general amnesty for political prisoners and fully restored political freedoms and civil rights. We have now set ourselves the task of carrying out as soon as possible the process of restoring the. rights that were violated and normalizing the situations that were altered by the previous regime. Uruguayan democracy is once more on the march.On the international level  one of the first acts of our Government was to ratify the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. In keeping with our traditions  we have renewed our struggle for human rights everywhere  under all systems of government. We shall pursue that struggle without bringing ideological considerations to bear and without making choices on the basis of self-interest.For this reason  our Government cannot but strongly condemn apartheid  that remnant of a blighted era  and withhold recognition of the interim government of Namibia illegally established by South Africa.Within the context of human rights  the international community must direct its attention to the effective application of that most basic of rights  the right to life.When one thinks of the tragic fact that millions of children die for lack of assistance it is impossible not to question the so-called progress of our human society. There could be no better way to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations than by concentrating our efforts on supporting the worthy task of child immunization undertaken by the united Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  so that the target of universal immunization by 1990 may be achieved.As a country that is emerging from a painful experience in this area  we urge Governments that are dedicated to peace to demonstrate their respect for basic human values by ratifying the conventions on human rights. We feel entitled to make such an appeal. Uruguay was one of the first countries to ratify the International Covenants on human rights and one of the few to accept the competence of the Committee to look into the complaints of individuals who have been victims of their violation. Moreover  Uruguay has not only ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  but was the first State to accept the competence of the relevant Committee.All of us who  in ate way or another  took part in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy know what sacrifices  patience and dedication were necessary to ensure that such a transition took place peacefully. But  great as the effort demanded by the restoration of democracy may have been  it was no greater than that which its maintenance is now requiring from us.Democracy is a fragile flower; we have ample and all too frequent proof of its fragile nature. It only grows and survives in the right soil and the right climate. A genuine democracy based on respect for the individual and on the periodical  free advice of the people can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. In other words  the close link between democracy and economic development must be recognized. When this condition is not fulfilled and poverty and unemployment prevail  violence emerges and is unleashed  the sowers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil  the fabric of society disintegrates and  in the international sphere  political loyalties become erratic.This does not mean that we in any way deny the formal operation of democracy  which is always a substantial guarantee that rights will be respected  but  inasmuch as the formal operation of democracy is a necessary condition of the existence of such rights  it is not sufficient to ensure its stability. It is our duty to ensure that our people can enjoy the basic conditions for growth and development  not only for reasons of honor - since it places its trust in us and we must comply with its will - or for humanitarian motives alone - considering  as we do  that the assurance of a full life is a fundamental right - but also because we must ensure peace  since we love life and cast in our lot with it. ""A hungry people "" said Seneca  ""does not listen to reason  is not pacified by justice  does not yield to entreaties."" The stability of democratic institutions is seriously threatened in many developing countries. The threat is real  grave and current. We who are responsible for steering the destiny of those countries are conscious of the gravity of the situation and of the fact that we have to make enormous efforts in terms of work and austerity.We cannot ignore the fact that  in order to correct this alarming situation  we must rely on ourselves and use our own resources. Let us not deceive ourselves; the strength that will enable us to surmount the obstacles to our development is also to be found above all within ourselves. A vigorous and bold attitude on the part of both our public and our private sectors is necessary to drive and guide this strength and mobilize the available resources.If Uruguay and Latin America as a whole wish to deal with the present situation speedily they must make an unprecedented effort in which the overall consensus on certain fundamental problems must take priority over domestic contradictions  divisive quarrels or sterile ideological disputes.However  we fully realize that our efforts  although indispensable  are not enough. It is our fate to live in a world in which international relations are beset by unprecedented difficulties. Our economies are affected by external factors that are beyond our control. Interest rates  which are still high  together with falling prices for our export products create situations that put a stranglehold on our balance of payments. In addition  we carry the burden of our foreign debt  the servicing of which  in present circumstances holds back any dynamic trend in our economies. The countries of Latin America face an unprecedented situation arising from the astronomical dimensions of their debts. They are thus caught in a spiraling process  in which each turn makes the possibility of repayment more remote.How have we reached such a situation? There is no need to repeat the history of the economic misadventures of the developing countries  but here in the General Assembly we must once again point out something which at this juncture is obvious  and that is that the creditor countries are also responsible for the disastrous situation afflicting the debtor countries and that a large part of the responsibility for its solution rests with them.It is short sighted and insensitive to believe that the only factors that have placed the debtor developing countries in this vertiginous spiral of debt that generates further debt are lack of responsibility on the part of those countries  their poor administration and their lack of foresight. We are raced with a situation that is imbued with tragic contradictions  not the least of which is that the creditor institutions and countries that demand payment of the debt and its interest are the same ones that  with their protectionist policies  their discriminatory messages and their subsidies  close off all the possibilities that the debtors have of generating the necessary resources to repay their debt.If the industrialized countries persist in denying the real origin and nature of these problems  if they do not shoulder their share of responsibility for the situation that prevails in the developing world  if they do not become less inflexible with regard to just demands for more equitable treatment  all our sacrifice will be a forlorn  wasted effort and there will be no reason for optimism regarding the survival of democracy.We do not expect acts of charity; we do not encourage anachronistic moratoriums. We ask for better trade; we ask for more technology; we ask to be allowed to sell *'n order to be able to pay and fulfill our obligations. We wish to grow in order to be able to pay  because we reject the alternative of paying and renouncing growth  just as we know that to ignore debts only leads to irresponsibility. These statements are made by Uruguay  a country which has just renegotiated its debt under the best conditions that can be expected in the present situation. We do not look at the problem  therefore  under the emotional influence of resentment. On the contrary  with the ease of mind provided by the long repayment periods obtained  we try to analyze it in historical perspective  over the long run and from the viewpoint of a legitimate mutuality of concerns.We thus consider that the fact that the creditor countries have not understood or have not wished to understand the real essence of the foreign debt problem  together with the obstacles that they set up against trade with the developing countries  the lack of results in the North-South dialog  the reluctance with which the principles of the new international economic order are accepted and applied  can only lead to a deep sense of frustration on the part of the developing countries.I do not believe that it is healthy for any of the sections into which the world is divided to continue this dialog of the deaf  where the only outcome has been to ease the guilty conscience of some and to offer only false and shallow remedies for the needs of others.The proclamation of the principles of the new international economic order and the subsequent attempts to make some of those principles a reality raised great expectations in international forums. But let us not be deceived. The new international economic order is for the time being simply a rhetorical listing of good intentions.The terms of trade of Latin America have deteriorated by 20 per cent during this decade  and in this very year  1985  the continent is prey to a new decline in prices. It already seems quite probable that the drop in prices of raw materials in 1985 will mean a loss of export income for the region as a whole of close to 310 billion.In the meantime  Latin America must continue to make new net transfers of resources abroad of nearly $30 billion  in addition to the $70 billion of the last > three years.In terms of our small country  this has meant that so far during 1985  all the prices of our raw materials have dropped by about 10 per cent  in addition to the sharp drop suffered during the decade as a whole.JSM/ed	&/40/PV.617Traditional markets for our meats are being closed to us because of the ruinous competition from highly subsidized meat being exported by the European Economic Communiity (EEC) countries. Our exports of industrial products based on the agriculture and livestock sector are threatened or excluded by all kinds of protectionist barriers.Does anybody believe that under these circumstances we can achieve a peaceful social climate and the conditions necessary to lay the foundations of economic development?I trust that those countries whose level of economic  political and social evolution ensures that they obtain the greater share of the benefits of progress will understand that if they adopt an attitude based less on national short-term interests and more on common long-term interests  they themselves will benefit. Surely it is more to their advantage to coexist with nations that have prosperous economies and stable governments  that are active markets  sure sources of supply and friendly partners  rather than be surrounded  as they now are  by States that are plunging towards insolvency and that bear within them the seeds of misery and of its inescapable corollary  violence?As Montesquieu said  ""An injustice to one is a threat to all.""Any opportunity to negotiate is welcome. But it will also be useless if all that the developed countries seek in the negotiations is to consolidate their positions of power  or if we  the developing countries  only use them as a pulpit for spreading ideologies or for making Utopian claims  instead of putting forward realistic demands or exchanging concessions on an equitable basis.We  the people of the developing world  must act more pragmatically and be aware that our solidarity has not yet developed sufficiently to be able to impose our conditions on those with whom we are dealing  we cannot expect gratuitous concessions. We must insist on our demands  but not expect too much from theJSM/ed	A/4Q/PV.618generosity of others. We must be radical in our principles but moderate in applying them.At the same time we should place greater stress on the possibilities that co-operation among equals can open up   Wa are convinced that if we were to put more energy and more imagination into managing our relations with countries that are in a situation similar to ours  either within our region or even elsewhere  we might find new avenues of progress. By intensifying or expanding co-operation with other developing countries  we can reduce the contradictions in our own economies.Latin America is  with a few exceptions  self-sufficient in terms of most of our commodities. However  despite the existence of areas and subregions with excess production  and others that cannot meet their own needs  there is not enough intraregional trade.During the last few years  only a fifth of the total value of commodity imports - including oil - came from Latin America. The Latin American region  for example  exported $7 300 million worth of food in 15)82  of which only $730 million worth went to other countries in the region.The value of its oil exports in 1982 amounted to $48 billion  of which only $5 billion were intraregional exports  while oil imports from the rest of the world amounted to $26 billion. In view of the severe external restrictions which our countries face  the fact that we are buying abroad the very same goods that we are producing within our own borders is a sign that we have failed to organize trade that it will provide us the greatest possible benefits.Consequently  we must stimulate economic integration among our countries. There must be more trade  more technical assistance  more transfer of technology  more co-operation in the areas of education and scientific research  more projects to establish multinational corporations  greater policy co-ordination  at the subregional  regional  continental or intercontinental level  in all areas in whichNR/gmr	A/40/PV.619 we have common interests. All these are channels which have not been sufficiently explored  that may open up new prospects for emerging from our economic stagnation.In this regard  I would like to call to mind the exercise in co-ordination and consultation that we  the debtor countries of Latin America  are carrying out through the Cartagena group with the purpose of negotiating collectively with our creditors on such a problem as that of the foreign debt which  has taken on a predominantly political dimension that requires a political solution  and that can no longer be dealt with simply as a mere relationship of a legal-financial nature between debtors and creditors.In this regard  we welcome and firmly support what the Secretary-General has stressed in his annual report to the General Assembly  to wit  that in recent years economic  financial  monetary and trade issues have become so interrelated and are of such profound political and social importance that they can only be dealt with effectively as part of a wider political process.We shall insist on that aspect of thiu problem  which in the long run will have to be accepted by industrialized countries. On this problem Latin America must be regarded and listened to as a united group. This does not imply a club of insolvent debtors seeking to reduce the amount or extend the term of their debts. No  a political focus has two meanings: one  that the merits of acting as a hemisphere be recognized; the other  that it be understood that the debt will be paid by means of growth and exports. Growth only comes about with investment. This implies receiving investments  and recycling into productive activities some of our savings from reducing the servicing of these liabilities. The aim of this political focus is not to default on our obligations or confront the financial system  but rather to seek a solution to the problem which  in the existing situation and with our usual resources  our countries will be unable to cope with in the long run  except at the price of chaos.tfSM/ad	VW/W.620Together with investment growth  however  we also need to increase our exports  in this regard we must be quite plain. The foreign debt problem is indissolubly linked to the trade problem.If the prices of our raw materials continue to decline* if the present protectionist barriers remain unchanged  if the present new trends  which auguring the dangers of an undeclared trade war with outdated and suicidal protectionist policies  are confirmed  there will he no lasting solution to the debt problem and the whole edifice that we have .ried to build with our post-war institutions may fall and pave the way to a world of stagnation or uncontrollable crises.MLG/giar	A/40/PV.626We also wish to be among the driving forces of world growth. Let us be allowed to produce; give us the resources with which to strengthen our capacity for investment and productive modernization; open up the doors to our export capacity  and the debt problem will be just one more financial problem on our agenda.Those are the essential terms of the problem; if today we were to imagine for em instant that foreign debt had magically disappeared  we would still not have found the solution to the roots of the problem. We would only have found incidental relief: that of maintaining the present international conditions of trade and investment flows. Within a decade we would surely witness a renewal of the same critical problems of today.To view foreign debt as a purely economic problem is as mistaken as to view the crisis in Central America as a purely political problem. Central America has lately become the stage of a tragedy where violence is manifest in all its forms: civil wars  conflicts across borders  terrorism  repression.How can we stop this infernal process that destroys lives  well-being and wealth  and that continues to inflict indescribable suffering on the peoples of that region  who deserve a better fate?Basically  the problem is deeply rooted  going way back beyond the time when the present Governments or political systems were established. The disease afflicting Central America is one that will not be cured if attention is not paid to its deeper causes - both political  economic and social. Within a context in which poverty and backwardness prevail in most sectors of the population that have traditionally been left on the sidelines by dynasties and elites  ideological aggression finds fertile ground.But to persist in viewing the Central American crisis as a crisis of an exclusively political and ideological nature is a mistake fraught with tragic consequences. Likewise  it would be a mistake to ignore the way in which these tragedies are exploited politically  or to think that there must be some lasting solution that is not based on strict observance of the principles held in greatest regard by the political traditions of Latin America  namely  non-intervention  respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States  non-use of force and non-use of the territory of one State to undermine the sovereignty and independence of another  wherever it may be  in Latin America or elsewhere  in America or in another continent.We believe that  at this time  the Contadora Group offers the most appropriate path to resolve the crisis. For this reason we have fully supported it and we have decided to contribute to its consolidation together with other sister countries of the region  as a mechanism through which peace in the region may be restored. But the work of the Contadora Group will be completely sterile if there is no change in the attitude of the countries involved in the crisis.We urge the latter to soften their attitudes based on preconceived ideas and prejudice  and to marshal their will to respond to what their respective peoples demand and need - that is to say  purely and simply  peace.I wish to remind those Governments - every one of them - that when they seek to satisfy their national interests without consulting the interests of others and without applying the basic standards of ethics and international law  their victories are short-lived and  ultimately  will not offset the damages suffered. Anecdotal history  as presented by newspaper or newsreel reports  radio and television  can extol the apparent but incidental successes obtained through pressure  the use of force or demagogy. However  the history that endures is very unremitting and will not be deceived  and it records and extols only those who respect the will of the people and struggle to meet their needs and aspirations.There are other disorders that afflict Latin America. Some are peculiar to itself and cannot be transferred  such as the many unresolved border disputes  fueled by immature and anachronistic visions of nationalism which eventually serve only to support arms races  with their devastating effects on our institutions.Others must be viewed in a different context  such as that in the subregion of which my country is a part - the South Atlantic  which was ravaged by war more than three years ago. The problem of the Malvinas is not simply a bilateral problem between Argentina and Great Britain. It is a Latin American problem and  as such  we assume it in its full dimension. The permanent British presence in the Malvinas ignores one of the principles which were the basis of the political organization of the Ibero-American continent  the principle of utipossidetis  which was formulated and applied on the continent long before Great Britain's de facto occupation of the Malvinas which had the effect  precisely  of not allowing any American territory to remain unclaimed and open to occupation by extra-continental Powers.We trust that Great Britain  which knew when the historical moment was ripe to abandon vast possessions all over the world  will succeed in reconciling the dictates of law with the rules of international coexistence. Hence we support Argentina's claims and we are prepared to do everything in our power to contribute to a rapprochement between those two parties at the negotiating table.Uruguay  the product of the same genealogy as that of Argentina  is convinced of the justice of its position; it has maintained historical ties of co-operation with Great Britain  sealed in brotherhood during the Second world War; and it appeals in this forum to the two parties to find solutions to a situation which cannot remain unchanged without peril to us all.We are all aware of the long list of situations and conflicts that endanger in world peace and security. Small States  such as Uruguay  are powerless witnesses to the tragedy of subjugated States  of nations torn apart and of peoples victimized by ideological wars and by expansionist ambitions  in the case of the Middle East conflict the worst has happened: it has become a routine problem; we have learned to live with it. In the meantime  millions of human beings are experiencing insecurity  fear and exile  we believe that it is time for all those directly affected by the situation in the Middle East to accept the notion that there will be no prospects for a lasting peace while there are parties who insist on not recognizing Israel's right to existence as a State  while the need to establish safe and recognized borders is not acknowledged  and while the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is not recognized  without the constant coercion of forces that only raise their flags for their own advantage. Moreover  peace in the region will not be secured if the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon is not reaffirmed and respected. Its territory must be freed from the presence of foreign armed forces  regardless of their origin.Afghanistan  Kampuchea  the Iran-Iraq war  the situation of Namibia and of the majority of the people of South Africa - all are situations that are not consistent with what the Governments involved state in international forums. It is tragic to perceive the deep gap between the world of words and proclamations heard in this forum and the world of reality. This gap is illustrated by the appeals for peace and the declarations insisting on the need for disarmament and the need to create an international atmosphere conducive to confidence and security that are made by the very same States that have embarked upon an arms race of colossal dimensions.Let us not be content with our actions. Our children  surely  will have much to reproach us for and may never be able to forgive the omissions which are so prevalent. I propose that we discard the assumption of self-satisfaction and apply# in its place  Albert Einstein's maxim  ""The most grievous fault is not to be aware of any fault.""The arms craze  which is taking on interplanetary dimensions  is the worst threat that hovers over the collective aspirations of our peoples and the individual happiness of their members.It is a threat that makes us feel that we are not the masters of our destiny  which remains entirely in the hands of the ruling elites of the great Powers. It is stupefying to think that there are 50 000 nuclear warheads ready to be detonated  while the use of a small fraction of such an arsenal is more than sufficient to cause disasters  loss of life and catastrophic damage to the environment.Perhaps the most tragic contradiction of the world we live in is that if the budget that finances that lethal fraction were to be earmarked  not for the massive construction of artefacts for destruction and death  but rather for co-operation and aid  the lives of millions of human beings who are suffering and dying of hunger at this very moment in the desolate lands of Africa could be saved  and disease and ignorance could be eradicated in the American continent.One is justified in hoping that those responsible for the warlike escalation will have a moment of supreme enlightenment.which will lead them to put a stop to this suicidal race and devote to life a part of the resources  talents and energy that they now devote to death.The world is at present going through a period that is as disturbing as it is promising.Never before  since the post-war period  have we been shaken by so much uncertainty regarding the future  by so many threats to peace  which is being violated systematically in many corners of the earth and exposed every day to the risk of a nuclear holocaust  by so much ambivalence regarding the economic situation  by the tragic persistence of irritating differences between the rich world of the North and the poor world of the South  by so much racial  religious and nationalist strife  by the widespread daily presence of insane terrorism of all types.As we face this situation  so often denounced and so often ignored  we view with similar apprehension the breaking-up of a whole edifice of multilateral organizations established to defend solidarity among men and nations  organizations that today are weaker than they have ever been since the post-war period and  in some cases  under serious threat of extinction.The present state of international relations is not a cause for optimism regarding the future of the human race. But optimism is not a rational sentiment: in these sombre times it is the nutrient the spirit needs to continue living. Thus it was for us  even during the most difficult hours of the long night that lay over our country for more than a decade  during which freedoms were lost and happiness disappeared from our land. But time justified those of us who waited with faith; reason  commonsense and the instinct of coexistence finally prevailed. Power was returned to the people with not a drop of blood shed  and the democratic institutions recovered their status and their authority.Our specific experience  very much our own  leads us to aver that if Uruguay was able to find its way peacefully back to democracy  it was because there were people who thought that peace would not come alone  that peace was not simply the result of abstaining from violence  that peace was a valuable political endeavor which required action  struggle and strategy.In Latin America we have returned to democratic life. During this year both Uruguay and Brazil have done so  following the course taken earlier by Argentina.We have seen the consolidation of the Peruvian and Bolivian processes  despite the threats that the wrathful unleashed against both sister countries.We have hailed an exemplary peace agreement regarding the borders between Argentina and Chile. This is proof of a prospect for hope  which in turn makes co-operation in the region our duty: and we wish to state here and now that we are doing our duty  that we are already doing it in the political  cultural and commercial spheres and that we wish to continue to do it  with neither aggressive nor resentful feelings towards anyone. We know that a lasting peace will not be on a firm footing until democracy prevails in all our countries  because it is the only way to avoid the interference of alien dogmatisms and interests.As Uruguayans we cast our lot with peace  as well as with change  the conferring of dignity on work and life  and the new approaches that the end of the century is already requiring of us. But  above all  we cast our lot with peace  which is nothing less than a means of achieving freedom and development. ■Revolutions "" Bertold Brecht advised so correctly  ""occur at dead ends."" That will not happen in Uruguay where all the channels of understanding and comprehension are open  open within the country and open towards the rest of the world.You may be sure that Uruguay will sow only seeds of harmony.In closing  I wish to convey to this Assembly a deep feeling of shared pain and brotherly hope. Shared pain regarding the tragedy which has cast the people of Mexico  our noble brothers  into mourning. Its tragedy is the tragedy of America as a whole. I wish to reiterate that my country  within the context of its modest strength  wishes to be on the front line of solidarity and support for Mexico  which is so greatly admired and to which our people owe a debt of imperishable gratitude for the noble and generous way in which it remained at our side during the past years when so many Uruguayans found in Mexico a brotherly haven.But I also wish to express a feeling of hope. Mexico always reaps growth from its adversities. That has been its history and that will be its present. It is for this reason that  faced with this pain  we oust pay tribute - and this is a final word here - to the cry of hope that has endured throughout the history of this nation: Long live Mexico!"
"129",7236,"USA",40,1985,"Let me start by joining the President of Brazil in conveying to the people and Government of Mexico our deep sympathy over the devastation wrought by earthquakes and our solidarity with them as they work to recover and rebuild. We admire the way the Government and people of Mexico are dealing with their problem. For our part  we a?.9 responding rapidly to Mexico's request for assistance with medicine  blankets and equipment to help in removing rubble  searching for survivors and fighting fires. But these are Mexico's short-term needs. The long-range impact and cost of the earthquakes are still being determined  but one thing is clear - they will be enormous. Here  too  the United States is prepared to respond to Mexico's plight.As I look at the devastation - and  perhaps  as you do on your television screens and you see the pictures  you cannot help but be struck by the thought that Mexico City in some ways looks war-torn. Of course  an earthquake is not a man-made event. When the earth shook in Mexico there was nothing anyone could do about it. But our task here at the United Nations is to see to it that man does not cause the earth to shake. So let us devote ourselves to the cause of peace and freedom.Three years ago  when I addressed this body for the first time  I stressed the need for realism. There is probably no other quality so appropriate and necessary for this Organization. But realism does not mean cynicism  or even pessimism. It means a clear-sighted appreciation of the opportunities we face  as well as of the obvious problems. It means remembering the many challenges that the world community has overcome  and drawing lessons from that. It means understanding that idealism and the yearning for human betterment are themselves part of reality  and thus have enormous practical significance.The founding fathers of the United Nations are sometimes accused of naive Utopianism. Supposedly they ignored the realities of power politics in attempting to create a global system of collective security. I doubt it. The men and women who set up this Organization 40 years ago were among the great statesmen of the century. They drafted the Charter as a set of standards for international conduct - knowing full well that the world's nations probably would fall short of those standards  but knowing also that the setting of high goals is a necessary precondition to their pursuit and attainment.The lofty goals of the Charter have a concrete  practical meaning today. They not only point the way to a better world? they reflect some of the most powerful currents at work in the contemporary world. The striving for justice  freedom  progress and peace is an ever-present and powerful reality that is today  more than ever  impressing itself on international politics.Our political thinking must catch up to this reality. The policies of nations must adapt to this basic human striving. This Organization  too  must adapt to reality; it cannot afford to consume itself in political warfare and unrealistic posturing. There is work to be done. Let us do it.The world community faces enormous challenges in three areas: in satisfying mankind's yearning for democracy  freedom and justice; in preserving and perfecting global peace and stability; and in spreading economic prosperity and progress.First  the guest for democracy and freedom. Since the end of the Second World War  modern communication has opened the eyes of most of the world's peoples to the realization that they do not have to live their lives in poverty and despair; that  on the contrary  the blessings of prosperity and liberty known in the past only by a relative few can be theirs as well. The ideals for which the war was fought  and the spread of democracy and of prosperity in the industrialized world since  created an explosion of expectations.The result has been in recent years a revolution of democratic aspirations sweeping the world. At the time of the San Francisco Conference in 1945  most of the nations represented in this hall today were not independent States but possessions - colonies of European empires. The vast number of languages  cultures and traditions that I can now see before me testify to the revolution in the world order. The old empires eventually had to accept the post-war reality of self-determination and national independence.Much of the conflict in the world today stems from the refusal of some governments to accept the reality that the aspirations of people for democracy and freedom simply cannot be suppressed for ever by force. In South Africa  these aspirations on the part of the bLack majority have as never before  drawn global attention and support. Change is inevitable. The issue is not whether apartheid is to be dismantled  but how and when. And then  what replaces it: race war  bloodbath  and new forms of injustice? Or political accommodation and racial coexistence in a just society? The outcome depends on whether and how quickly the South African Government can accept the new reality  and on whether men and women of peace on both sides can seize the opportunity before it is too late.This such is clear; there must be negotiation among South Africans of all races on constitutional reform. True peace will come only when the Government negotiates with  rather than locks up  representative black leaders. The violence will end only when 311 parties begin a mutual search for a just system of government.One area where the future has brightened in the past five years as the aspirations of the people to democracy have been met in country after country is Latin America - as President Sarney just said so eloquently. In contrast to only 30 per cent in 1979  today more than 90 per cent of the people of Latin America live under Governments that are either democratic or clearly on the road to democracy.In Central America  El Salvador  under the courageous leadership of President Duarte  has shown that democracy can take root and thrive even in the most difficult terrain. Its citizens have braved extremist violence to participate overwhelmingly in four free elections since 1982. Their President's current personal ordeal only serves to underscore the sacrifices thousands of Salvadorians continue to make as they fight to realize the ideals of the United Nations Charter. For this commitment they should be applauded by all Members. Ironically  El Salvador is today the only democracy subject to the scrutiny of a special rapporteur for human rights.Among El Salvador's neighbors  Costa Rica has long been the region's beacon of representative government; Honduras is about to replace one freely-elected government with another; and Guatemala is about to join them as a democratic nation with the election of a president in November. These developments should enhance regional co-operation for economic development  which the United States supports through our Caribbean Basin initiative and President Reagan's initiative for peace  development and democracy.But regional peace in Central America is threatened by the rulers of Nicaragua and their Soviet and Cuban allies. Behind a cloak of democratic rhetoric  the Nicaraguan communists have betrayed the 1979 revolution and embarked upon a course of tyranny at home and subversion against their neighbors. Brave Nicaraguans are fighting to restore the hope for freedom in their country and the other nations of the region are working together in collective self-defense against Nicaraguan aggression.How can this crisis be resolved? The Central American nations  together with their nearest neighbors  the members of the Contadora Group  have subscribed to a document of 21 objectives. These include non-interference in the affairs of one's neighbors  serious dialog with domestic opposition groups  free elections and democracy in each country  the removal of foreign military personnel and a reduction of armaments. My Government supports a verifiable treaty based on full and simultaneous implementation of the 21 objectives. We welcome the resumption of talks next month in Panama and hope they lead to a final agreement. Contadora is the best forum for pursuing a settlement.In El Salvador  President Duarte  true to his pledge to the Assembly last year  has pursued a dialog with the guerrilla opposition. Would that the rulers of Nicaragua would make - and honor  a similar pledge to the Assembly this year. In San Jose on 1 March of this year the Nicaraguan democratic resistance called for internal dialog  moderated by the Roman Catholic Church  to end the killing.The people of the region are waiting for a positive answer from the rulers of Nicaragua. Can it be that  never having been chosen by their people in a truly free election  they lack the confidence to face opponents they cannot silence or lock up  as they have so many others? The united Nicaraguan opposition deserves to participate in Nicaraguan political life and has an important role to play in the diplomatic process. Regional peace will not come without it.The reality of democratic revolution is also demonstrated by the rise of national liberation movements against communist colonialism: in Afghanistan  Cambodia  Angola and other lands where  as in Nicaragua  people have organized in resistance to tyranny. Unlike the old European empires that came to accept the post-war reality of self-determination and national independence  the new colonialists are swimming against the tide of history. They are doomed to fail.In Afghanistan the almost six-year-old Soviet invasion has inflicted untold suffering on a people whose will to resist and to free themselves from a pitiless tyranny cannot be broken. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans are dead or maimed  millions more make up the largest refugee population in the world and countless villages  schools and farms lie in ruins. Nowhere in the world has the carnage wrought by Soviet imperialism been greater than in Afghanistan and nowhere has the resistance been more determined and courageous.The withdrawal of Soviet forces  as the General Assembly has noted on six occasions  would lead to solution of the Afghanistan problem. A solution must also encompass restoration of the country's independence and non-aligned status  self-determination for the Afghan people and the return in safety and honor of the more than 3 million refugees  unless and until the Soviet Union permits such a solution the national liberation struggle in Afghanistan will continue  the world-wide effort to provide succor to a beleaguered people will go forward and Soviet protestations of peace on this and other issues will not ring true. My Government  together with others concerned  stands ready to implement a just solution to this problem.Cambodia  as we all know  stands as one of the worst examples in history of a totalitarian ideology carried to its bloodiest extreme. Today  courageous freedom fighters under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann struggle to reclaim their country. He continue to support the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) program for a peaceful solution; Vietnamese forces must withdraw completely  and Cambodia's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity must be restored under a Government chosen in free elections.In other countries where the apparatus of repression is well developed  countless thousands of men and women wage private struggles for freedom  armed only with their consciences and their courage. Some suffer for their political convictions  others for their religious beliefs: solidarity trade unionists in Poland; Jews  Baptists  Roman Catholics  Pentecostalists and others in the Soviet Union; Baha is in Iran. With all the men and arms at their disposal  what are these Governments afraid of?These brave and often nameless prisoners of conscience struggle to achieve for men and women in every corner of the world the promises of this Organization. He are with them  and we call on all States as Members of this body to honor their solemn commitments. As Thomas Jefferson once said ""The opinions of men and women are not the rightful object of any Government  anywhere.""The quest for peace continue on many fronts. And for all the obstacles confronting it  there are examples of success - such as the treaty on Antarctica  which recently marked a quarter century of effective international co-operation. We can learn from problems overcome as we tackle the formidable problems ahead.In the Middle Bast  10 or 15 years ago  peace between Israel and any Arab State seemed a remote  if not impossible  dream. Finally  after untold suffering and four wars  a courageous leader  Anwar El-Sadat  abandoned the old ways of thinking and took the step no other Arab leader had been willing or prepared even to contemplate: he recognized that the State of Israel was here to stay and  with Prime Minister Begin  vowed there would be no more wars. Peace and normal relations were established  and the Sinai was returned.The past year has seen major efforts toward new negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The United States is committed and engaged in support of those efforts  in accordance with President Reagan's initiative of three years ago. Yet the lesson of the past is clear: progress can be achieved only through direct negotiations  based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). There is no other way  and evasion of this reality only prolongs suffering and heightens dangers. Nothing positive will ever be achieved by chasing illusions of so-called armed struggle; but much can be accomplished by parties who are committed to peace and engaged in serious dialog. The moment is at hand - this year - to make major progress and to begin direct negotiations.To the east  we have the continuing failure of reason to prevail and end the devastating war between Iran and Iraq. Prolonged by Iran's refusal to come to terms with its inability to achieve victory  this war has now entered its fifth year  with no end in sight. We again call on both parties to negotiate an end to the fighting.On the Korean peninsula we see the first tentative steps being taken to get away from the mode of thinking that has characterized the pa at years. A decade ago  there seemed little hope for a significant reduction of tension. Yet last year both Koreas began a multifaceted  direct dialog  which the United States supports as the key to a solution. While the animosities of a lifetime are not resolved quickly  a start has been made. We also believe that membership in the United Nations for both the Republic of Korea and North Korea  in accordance with the principle of universality  would help reduce tensions.Perhaps the most dramatic problem that requires new ways of thinking is international State-sponsored terrorism. Terrorism is every bit as much a form of war against a nation's interests and values as a full-scale armed attack. And it is a weapon wielded particularly against innocent civilians  against free nations  against democracy  against moderation and against peaceful solutions. It is an affront to everything the United Nations stands for.Progress has been made against the terrorist threat through co-operation in the United Nations system. Many nations subscribe to The Hague  Tokyo and Montreal Conventions to make air travel safer and to suppress hijacking and sabotage. Progress has also been made in providing protection for diplomats  and some nations have agreed on how to handle hostage situations. Just this month  participants at the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders  held at Milan  adopted a strong  broad-ranging resolution urging all States to adhere to these agreements and to strengthen international actions against terrorism.Much more remains to be done. The United States and other nations  for example  are working with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to improve standards of security. Over this past year  so far 90 potential terrorist actions against United States facilities or citizens have been deterred or prevented. But the fight has only begun  and it cannot be won by one Government alone. The civilized world must put the terrorists and their supporters on notice: we will defend ourselves in any and every way we can.The reality of the nuclear age has spelled the United States and the Soviet Union to engage in a dialog  of varying intensity  for the past 40 years. This dialog has been an unprecedented attempt by two rivals to manage their competition and avert war. We know that we share a responsibility for maintaining peace  not just for our peoples  but for all the earth's peoples.Despite all the difficulties  let us remember what has been accomplished. After the two most destructive wars in history  the super-Powers  joined with others  have averted world war for four decades. We have had some success in limiting nuclear testing. Working together with other nations since the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968  we have succeeded in restricting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Twenty years ago it was conventional wisdom that there would be 15 to 25 nuclear-weapon States by today; yet the number of States acknowledged to possess nuclear weapons has held at five for the past 20 years. The United States remains committed to all the goals of the Treaty  whose Third Review Conference just concluded successfully in Geneva. And the United States and the Soviet Union have taken practical steps to avoid conflict. Our navies have long agreed to work together to prevent incidents at sea. And we have set up and improved the ""hot line"" for crisis communications.In the nuclear and space arms talks in Geneva  the United States has advanced far-reaching proposals: a reduction by almost one-half in the most destabilizing weapons  strategic ballistic missile warheads  and the elimination of the whole class of the United States and Soviet longer-range intermediate-range nuclear forces missiles worldwide  all leading ultimately to the complete elimination of nuclear arms. We repeatedly have stressed our readiness for give and take and to consider alternative proposals. Each of our proposals has been followed up by further attempts to find common ground with the Soviet Union. He have offered trade-offs and have made clear our readiness to take account of legitimate Soviet concerns to obtain an agreement that would enhance strategic stability and strengthen deterrence..Progress at Geneva has been slow. Thus far the Soviet Union has not negotiated with the responsiveness that the talks require. None the less  our determination to reach an equitable agreement has not wavered.In this spirit  President Reagan last June decided to continue our policy of taking no action that would undercut the limits of previous agreements  to the extent the Soviet Union shows comparable restraint. Despite serious reservations about those agreements  and serious concerns about the Soviet record of non-compliance.'  the President made this decision to foster a climate of truly mutual restraint to facilitate progress in arms control.While the most direct path to a safer world is through equitable  verifiable reductions  we also see value in verifiable limitations on nuclear testing. For that reason  President Reagan  in his speech to this body last year  proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union exchange visits of experts at test sites to measure directly the yields of nuclear-weapon test. This would significantly improve confidence in the verifiability of proposed treaty limits on underground testing. The Soviet Union rejected this offer. Nevertheless  last July  the President issued an unconditional invitation for a Soviet team to observe and measure a nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site. We again call on the Soviet Union to take up this offer  which is a concrete  positive step toward verifiable restrictions on nuclear testing. When the Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty was signed in 1972 it was assumed that tight limits on defensive systems would make possible real reductions in strategic offensive arms. But the Soviet Union has never agreed to any meaningful reductions in offensive nuclear arms. Instead  it has continued an unprecedented military build-up - particularly in heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles with a first-strike capability - which is eroding the basis on which deterrence has rested for decades. The strategy of reliance on offensive retaliation to preserve deterrence and prevent war thus is being called into question by Soviet actions.The answer is  first  for us both to agree that strategically significant  verifiable reductions in the numbers and destructive potential of offensive weapons. But there are additional ways to redress the problem. President Reagan has directed our scientists and engineers to examine  in the light of new technologies and fully in accord with the Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty - the feasibility of defense against ballistic-missile attack. Strategic defense could give our children and grandchildren a safer world. We would continue to rely on deterrence to prevent war  but deterrence would be based more on denying success to a potential attacker and less on threatening massive mutual destruction. Such a means of deterrence should be safer and more stable. Our goal is not to achieve superiority but to add to the security of both sides. As former Soviet Premier Kosygin said  an anti-missile system ""is intended not for killing people but for saving human lives"". The Soviet Premier was right.We want to co-operate with the Soviet union in making progress on these most important of all issues. Progress requires - it demands - good will  realism and honesty. Behind the curtain that encloses Soviet society  free from the open debate we see in the West  a major strategic defense program has proceeded for decades. The current Soviet leaders know that. In the past 20 years the Soviet Union has spent about as much on strategic defense as on its offensive nuclear forces. The Soviets know that. The Soviets have the world's most active military space program  last year conducting about 100 space launches  some 80 per cent of which were purely military in nature  compared to a total of about 20 United States space launches. The Soviets know that  too. They deploy the world's only anti-ballistic-missile system  whose nuclear-armed interceptors and other components are undergoing extensive modernization. They are researching many of the same new technologies as we  and are ahead in some. And the Soviet Union has the world's only extensively tested and fully operational anti-satellite system. The Soviet leaders know full well their own efforts in these fields. Their propaganda about American programs is blatantly one-sided and not to be taken seriously.So let us get down to real business  with the seriousness the subject deserves  and let us do so in the quiet of the negotiating room  where we can really make progress cm narrowing our differences.Progress needs to be made in other arms-control areas as well. Restraints on chemical and biological weapons have eroded in recent years as international agreements have been violated by the Soviet Union and others. In April 1984 the United States proposed a comprehensive treaty for a global ban on chemical weapons. We will again introduce a draft resolution on chemical weapons in the First Committee. We must have talks on serious  verifiable proposals.To reduce the risk of conflict through miscalculation we and our Atlantic allies have proposed significant confidence- and security-building measures at the Conference on Disarmament in Europe. To enhance security in Central Europe we have repeatedly sought ways to move the mutual and balanced force reduction talks in Vienna forward.In sum  the United States and the Soviet Union now have a historic opportunity to reduce the risk of war. President Reagan looks forward to his meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev in November. We have a long agenda. The United States is working hard to make it a productive meeting and we want the meeting itself to give a further impetus to the wide-ranging dialog on which we are already embarked. Soviet acts of good faith and willingness to reach fair agreements will be more than matched on the American side.Just as there is a democratic revolution in the world today  so there is also a revolution in economic thinking. Mankind is moving towards an ever greater recognition of the inescapable tie between freedom and economic progress. Command economies  in spite of all their pretensions  have not done very well in liberating people from poverty. In reality  they have served as instruments of power for the few rather than of hope for the many. Expectations of material progress and prosperity have been fulfilled in countries whose Governments have applied reason and fresh thinking to their problems  learning from experience rather than slavishly Allowing outworn dogma. The new way of thinking - economic freedom -actually is a return to old truths that many had forgotten or never understood.Those developing countries in Asia relying on free market policies  for example  have enjoyed one of the most remarkable economic booms in history despite a relative lack of natural resources. The ASEAN nations and the Republic of Korea have grown at a 7 per cent a year rate over the past decade  the fastest rate in the world  and ASEAN has become a model of regional development and political co-operation. In recognition of the success of economic freedom the island nations of the South Pacific have continued to encourage the private sector as well. We are joining with them in a dedicated effort to negotiate quickly a regional fisheries agreement that will benefit all.The success of these and other countries demonstrates that the laws of economics do not discriminate between developed and developing. For all nations equally the true source of wealth is the energy and creativity of the individual  not the State. After decades of fashionable socialist doctrine we see today on every continent efforts to decentralize  deregulate  denationalize and enlarge the scope for producers and consumers to interact in the free market. In India  China and elsewhere new policies are being adopted to unleash the creative abilities of talented peoples. At the Bonn economic summit last May the leaders of the largest industrial democracies acknowledged the same truth. The road to prosperity begins at the same starting point for all nations: freedom and incentives for the individual.This truth should be our guide as we address today's economic challenges .In sub-Saharan Africa drought has placed perhaps 30 million men  women and children at risk. We do not know how many have already died. Along with other Western countries  the United States has undertaken one of the largest disaster relief programs in history. This year alone the United States has provided $1.2 billion for drought and famine relief and $800 million in other economic assistance. The nations that have been helping should continue to do so; those that have not borne their share should start to do so.But we owe it to the suffering to ask this question: Why is food so scarce? Drought  without question  is part of the reason  but in some countries there are other  more important reasons. One is Government policies that have severely harmed agricultural productivity. These policies must be reversed. Those countries that have undertaken liberalizing reforms are reaping the benefits and can show the way for others. Another problem is lack of appropriate technologies. The United States is carrying out a long-term program to strengthen African agricultural research  which we hope will help to produce a green revolution on the continent. Elsewhere in the developing world  as in Africa  countries face the continuing problem of debt. Many have undertaken necessary  though painful  adjustment  taking courageous steps to cut Government spending  eliminate subsidies and price controls  permit currencies to adjust to the market  free interest rates to encourage saving and discourage capital flight and create conditions to attract new capital. Austerity  however  is certainly not an end in itself. The purpose of short-term adjustment is to get back on the track of long-term growth.In all these efforts we must be careful that the heavy burden of servicing the historic debt levels of the developing nations of Latin America and Africa does not inhibit their future growth. Creative co-operation between borrowers and lenders  with continued constructive assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  will be essential in achieving that goal.Other nations too have a major part to play in helping these countries overcome their debt problem and resume sustainable growth. External financing to support effective adjustment has been and will continue to be important. Access to export markets is also necessary. Indeed  an open trading system is crucial to the hopes of all of us. Trade expansion has been an engine of post-war prosperity. It would therefore be suicidal to return to the protectionism of the 1920s and 1930s which helped bring on the great depression. Protectionism is not a cure; it is a disease  a disease that could cripple all of us. Trade must be free  open and fair. The United States will work to see that it is. But there must be a level playing field. We want open trading  but that means mutuality. Barriers erected against American products are just not acceptable to us.As President Reagan is saying today in a major speech ""The freer the flow of world trade  the stronger the tides for human progress and peace among nations."" To preserve and strengthen the trading system may well be the central economic issue facing the world community today. For that reason it is essential that all nations join now in preparations for a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. (GATT) round next year; no nation  even one as large and as powerful as the United States  can by itself ensure a free trading system. All that we and others have done to provide for the free flow of goods and services and capital is based on co-operation* Indeed  it was that very spirit of co-operation that prompted the United States and four of the leading industrial nations yesterday to pledge firm resolve to work together in addressing the pressing economic issues of this decade.Sound economic policies in every country are the key to strengthening the world economy. In the United States policies that have unleashed individual talent  reduced Government's role and stabilized prices have helped to produce more than 8 million new jobs since 1982 and lead the world out of recession. But many imbalances in the world economy remain  notably in trade accounts  exchange rates and capital flows. These must be corrected by the world community acting in concert if recent economic gains are to be preserved and hopes for progress sustained. For its part  the United States must restrain public spending  reduce its budget deficit and encourage saving. Others must do more to reduce rigidities and promote the private investment needed to facilitate adjustment and spur expansion.I believe we can surmount our problems just as we succeeded in solving the energy crisis and bringing inflation under control. There was a time when those problems too seemed insurmountable. We can succeed again today if we have the honesty and courage to face our problems squarely and if our ways of thinking conform to reality.Forty years ago the founders of the United Nations recognized that new ways had to be found to regulate conduct between nations. That remains true today. The Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights speak to us  not as different races  creeds and nationalities  but as human beings  men and women. Our task as we look at the next century is to learn that the things which unite us - the desire for peace  human rights and material well-being - as set down in those documents are far more important than the things which divide us.The main obstacle to greater realization of the goals of the Charter is the lust of the few for power over the many  just as it has been the obstacle to human happiness since the dawn of history. But change is inevitable. And today change  technological change  holds out hope perhaps as never before. The revolution in communications and information may be the most far-reaching development of our time. Those political systems that try to stand in the way of the free flow of knowledge and information will relegate their citizens to second-class status in the next century. The future belongs to societies that can spread knowledge  adapt  innovate  tap the unfettered talents of well-informed citizens and thus fully exploit the new technologies; free societies clearly are best equipped for this challenge. The communications revolution will be a truly liberating revolution  for it threatens the monopoly of information and thought upon which tyrants rely for absolute control.On every continent - from Nicaragua to Poland  from South Africa to Afghanistan and Cambodia - we see that the yearning for freedom is the most powerful political force all across the planet. The noble ideals of democracy and freedom are in the ascendant. Today  we can look with renewed hope to the day when the goals of the united Nations truly will be met."
"130",7353,"VEN",40,1985,"I should like  first of all  to convey to you. Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your broad and relevant experience in the United Nations  your outstanding capabilities and acknowledged spirit of conciliation do honor to your country and to this significant anniversary.I should also like once again to convey to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our sincere congratulations for his accomplishments as the head of our Organization.Forty years ago  in response to the strife and tragedy of the Second World War  the United Nations was created for the purpose of securing peace  development and coexistence  with mutual respect  among States. Today  when the possibility of confrontation seems not only to be getting the better of world leadership but also to be guiding some of its steps  it has become necessary to reaffirm that commitment. Decisive action is therefore required to give new life to this irreplaceable forum where we meet to combine our efforts. We are now celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations with mixed feelings that fluctuate between joy and uncertainty  deeply concerned because the principles and purposes that led to the establishment of the United Nations seem to fade before more immediate and subordinate interests  including a desire for domination which is as dangerous as it is outdated.Venezuela comes to this session of the General Assembly with a strengthened determination to achieve peace  justice and understanding among the peoples of the world; with the same determination with which  together with 50 other countries  it signed the San Francisco Charter  in circumstances unprecedented in the history of the world. We wished to bear witness through our presence here to the unswerving faith of the Venezuelan people in the potential of the United Nations  established with the support of Latin America  22 of whose countries are founding Members.By drawing up a balance-sheet of what has occurred on the international scene since 1945  we are in large measure analyzing the role fulfillled by the United Nations  the leading arena for far-reaching decisions and a reflection of international life itself  marked as it is by countless risks and conflicts. To examine the present situation of the international community and its future outlook inevitably involves judging the prospects  the relevance and the influence of the United Nations as a factor of rapprochement among States. Wars  confrontations and reckless actions during these times of upheaval paradoxically strengthen its relevance and the need to preserve it as a mechanism directed to the rule of reason in international relations.As the United Nations evolved it became evident that its action should encompass diverse areas if real peace was to be ensured and the deep causes of violence and the degradation of man were to be eradicated. The Organization had to assume new tasks  becoming a system dedicated not only to preventing conflict butalso to promoting economic and social development.The very membership of the United Nations reflects one of the major changes of the present day: a significant number of countries is playing an ever greater role in the formulation of policies and initiatives.In 1945 more than 750 million persons - almost a third of the world's population - lived under colonial rule. The historic process of decolonization that subsequently took place under the auspices of the United Nations made it possible for more than 70 countries in the three regions of the developing world to attain independence.In mentioning the many effects of decolonization  we must stress the role played by the majority group in the United Nations that the countries of Latin America constituted  and their outstanding performance in the debates and decisions of the General Assembly during the years prior to the incorporation of the young States of Africa  Asia and the Caribbean. He Latin Americans can feel proud to have been in the front line of the struggle against colonialism  a course of conduct that was no more than our duty in view of our historical roots and our commitment to freedom and solidarity. Simon Bolivar  the liberator  had shown us the way.This Organization has been and is faced with problems of extraordinary magnitude - problems that it has been unable to solve or mitigate  because of lack of goodwill  considerations of expediency  complicity  or simply lack of understanding of the great historical changes. These are situations that have posed a dilemma  that have acquired ever more alarming proportions and that have today become established priorities.In a great paradox of our times  the Powers that played a decisive role in establishing the United Nations soon undermined by their actions what they had so solemnly proclaimed at the end of the Second World War.Despite all the efforts deployed by this Organization  the nuclear-arms race between the super-Powers continues relentlessly to the consternation of all  carrying all of us with it as hostages to an uncertain and endangered future. The arguments with which we have tried to persuade those Powers to sponsor convincing disarmament and nuclear-arms-control measures have virtually been exhausted in what amounts to a deaf-ear policy on the part of the great Powers. Since 1945 the General Assembly alone has adopted more than 600 resolutions on subjects linked to disarmament in a markedly progressive trend.We cannot console ourselves with a deceptive nuclear peace advocated by both sides but bearing within it an incalculable destructive potential  nor can we accept  in line with this strategic sophism  pretexts to carry the confrontation to other theaters and to further nuclear intimidation in clear violation of international treaties on the use of outer space. We therefore support and shall continue to support resolutely all initiatives aimed at demilitarizing space. Here there can be no room for doubt or hesitation.The struggle against underdevelopment is as important as the struggle for peace. In recent years there has been a process of erosion that has undermined the very basis of the political consensus on which international co-operation for development is based.This situation of uncertainty regarding the present relevance of the commitment to the problem of development generates a lack of confidence and leads to a greater degree of insecurity regarding the future of all.We cannot claim that we lack the necessary resources. The intellectual and material heritage of humanity if used rationally would be sufficient to overcome poverty and stagnation. It is time therefore to invest it in the priorities demanded by that objective. We must reflect on whether we can continue to consent to a world characterized by intolerable domination  factions in conflict and repressed tension.- These scenarios  which are no less real because they are sombre  strengthen our conviction that  as was originally established by the Charter  it is the duty of this Organization to be a center for harmonizing efforts and wills in order to rescue economic and social development as one of the collective priorities of our time and to allow us in practice to overcome technical difficulties  reconcile our interests and go forward together.We must renew our commitment to development  without excuses or ambiguity  without paternalism or ulterior motives  reflecting our resolve for decisive action.One of the most urgent problems of this decade stems from the lack of a system for financing development and the weakening of the institutions that were created for that purpose. I refer to the foreign debt of developing countries which threatens to paralyze economic growth  erode the process of democratization  upset social peace and destabilize the international financial system. It is a problem that involves the entire international community. The responsibility lies equally with the debtor countries  the creditor countries  private banking and international financial institutions. All of them therefore must be responsible for its solution; and to try to evade this responsibility may  in our opinion  be a mistake of unforeseeable dimensions.To prevent the debt problem from ending in a crisis the debtor countries are making significant efforts requiring sacrifices on the part of their populations and advancing adjustment programs that have helped to improve their balance of payments. But such efforts cannot be sustained in the medium term. It is obvious that the debt problem cannot be solved at the expense of the well-being of the people and that a responsible Head of State can hardly endanger the future of his nation by carrying sacrifices to an extreme in order to settle its commitments. It is evident that each country's conduct is colored by different realities  but the debt problem in its dimensions and basic characteristics is of an inescapable collective nature.Thus it is obvious that only the sustained economic growth of the debtor countries will enable them to comply with their foreign obligations.Unfortunately  the serious  calm behavior of the debtor countries has not obtained a satisfactory response from the other countries and institutions involved. We have reached th point where the only method proposed for resolving this problem has been the absurdity of turning the developing countries into net capital exporters and the only method of action recommended at the international level has been the imposition of policies that stimulate recession and unemployment.The industrialized countries must participate actively with the debtor countries in seeking more conclusive solutions to the debt problem and  in particular  in establishing protective mechanisms to cope with the high interest rates that are kept high so as to attract the capital necessary to finance deficits and high standards of living  while our countries  on the contrary  are being obliged to adopt severe adjustment measures at the cost of great sacrifice in order to eliminate existing deficits and honor our commitments.From the standpoint of international solidarity there is no justification whatsoever for keeping real interest rates several points above the rate of inflation  as has been the practice in international financial markets. It is indispensable and urgent that we seek a solution of this problem in order to relieve the burden implied by debt servicing and to avoid worsening the economic situation- of the developing countries.The lack of will to find shared solutions increases the possibility that we shall in the end face a crisis. Those who feel that the danger has been averted by the fact that the most difficult consequences of the problem have been postponed and have not yet affected international financial centers are mistaken. The danger remains. The advances made to date have only contributed to preventing a confrontation and to keeping open the possibility of dialog. If  however  this dialog does not take place  if it does not find substantive solutions  if it does not cover all the countries involved  these advances will have been illusory.The Latin American countries  through the Cartagena Consensus  have proposed a dialog at the governmental level aimed at finding real and lasting solutions to the debt problem. Unfortunately  we met with no response. This leads us to the paradoxical situation in which the more the stability of the international financial system depends on us the more difficult it is made for us to find counterparts with whom to seek formulas that will enable us to maintain that stability.We are determined that these formulas shall be of a multilateral nature  but we cannot remain passive if they are not achieved  because we cannot allow the fate of our peoples to remain at the mercy of an uncertain international economy; nor can we compromise the development of our nations beyond reasonable limits.Venezuela  like other debtor countries  has stated and given proof of its firm desire to fulfill its foreign commitments. In our case we have established restructuring agreements with our creditors that lessen the impact of debt on our efforts to ensure our national development. We believe  on the basis of current estimates  that our commitments are viable. A contingency clause has been included in these agreements that allows for changes to be made in the event of special situations caused by fortuitous circumstances or force majeure  or in the case of substantial economic changes that modify the basis of the agreement. We believe that this should be a universal standard for refinancing agreements.Moreover  experience of negotiations has taught us that an effort is necessary to create international economic conditions that will not endanger agreements already reached  that countries cannot be required to assume obligations that they are unable to fulfill  and that it is damaging to try to take advantage of or disregard the situation of countries experiencing very difficult circumstances. In this respect  we consider it necessary to establish  through dialog  a mutually acceptable general frame of reference that takes into account the development needs and need for well-being of peoples and the need to establish a stable development-financing system and the will to regularize international financial commitments.However great Latin America's efforts  its problems cannot be overcome without a revitalization of its economies  and this requires the orderly and sustained growth of the world economy. But this essential balance cannot be achieved while the big industrialized countries maintain unnecessary protectionist barriers which with absurd  excessive selfishness they even seek to strengthen.There is a close link between the fulfillment of their financial obligations by our countries and their prospects of economic and trade expansion. Our exports must grow so that we can pay our foreign debt  but first and foremost to generate the resources necessary to finance our development. We cannot devote the fruits of our adjustment efforts exclusively to debt-servicing  as we have been doing over the past four years. In 1984  for example  Latin America had a trade surplus of $37 billion  the largest in its history  but we had to transfer it to our creditors in interest payments. In fact  Latin America has become a net exporter of capital  which is a strange situation for a region of developing countries. Since 1982 this net transfer of resources has reached $70 billion  which in real terms is equal to nearly twice the resources used under the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of the war-ravaged European economies.The development of circumstances makes it necessary for the General Assembly to undertake at this fortieth session  in the economic sphere  an essential exercise in joint reflection in which we seriously analyze the present situation and attempt to reach a common diagnosis which will enable us immediately to undertake the necessary action.In matters of trade  there has never before been such a demand for respect for principles and standards together with such a lack of compliance  such threats of trade war and such repeated and open use of the unilateral imposition of measures.As regards matters of finance  it is scarcely necessary to recall that unless the multilateral bodies have the required resources and appropriate policies it will be at best a coincidence if we are able to overcome the widespread debt problem.In monetary matters  there is no prospect of controlling the persistent instability of exchange rates or of reaching a level of international liquidity in keeping with the present situation and the foreseeable needs of the economies enduring harsh adjustment processes at a time when foreign credit is Contracting. We lack the operational mechanisms needed to deal efficiently with the international trade and financial situation  which is characterized by volatility and instability. It is even more significant that institutions designed to promote monetary and payments stability and an adequate flow of resources for development are undergoing disturbing changes in their purposes and objectives and being transformed from mechanisms for international co-operation into factors for control and security for the benefit of biased interests.In our view  it is more necessary than ever before to co-ordinate economic policies multilaterally  both for sustained growth and for development  and the scope and priorities of that co-ordination cannot be disregarded by this Organization.Certainly  it was not without interest that we received the information about the talks held recently by Finance Ministers and Governors of the central banks of the Federal Republic of Germany  the United States  France  the United Kingdom and Japan. Although nothing specific resulted from that meeting  and the reports that did emerge were cloaked in the traditional frustrating wordiness  the timid acknowledgment of the need to resist protectionist measures  the possibility of opening markets to our exports and a certain understanding of matters concerning reasonable interest rates and the granting of financing in suitable quantities and on suitable conditions could mean that we are witnessing a change in the perceptions of the great Powers. The developing world has been waiting for a long time for the necessary dialog to materialize.Oil continues to be one of the basic elements of the world economy. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is now 25 years old. Its noteworthy efforts throughout that time constitute one of the most just claims of the raw-material-producing countries to promote and achieve more just  rational trade between the developing and the industrialized countries.Once again OPEC is issuing warnings that are not being heeded in world economic centers. Our warnings to the industrialized countries concerning the risks arising from an unstable  anarchic oil market and the negative repercussions of an erosion of prices on world financial and commercial markets have fallen on deaf ears. What we have said about the rapid depletion on the oil reserves of importing countries and of exporters not members of our organization has been ignored. The reaction has been short-sighted indifference.OPEC will continue to defend its right to establish the terms of trade for this strategic source  which is essential for international economic development.In Latin America we are facing the challenge of the social and economic development of our peoples  we are also  through the Contadora Group  tenaciously and with perseverance attempting to ward off the crisis in Central America. This action in the cause of peace and good will  which has been given the support and encouragement of the international community  has now been strengthened through the establishment of a support group composed of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  in a categoric demonstration of the fact that Latin America is prepared to resolve its own problems according to Latin America criteria and formulas  that we are deeply aware of the problem and that determined solidarity is being brought to bear to resolve it.We unequivocally reject the interference in the region of opposing factors alien to the authentic aspirations of the peoples of Latin America  which in some way agitate and seek to undermine the possibilities of establishing peace and understanding in Central America. We believe that all the countries directly concerned in the region desire peace and that there are no sectors of the area bent on prolonging war-mongering speculation in connivance with foreign interests. We also believe that there is no more room to maintain the privileges and advantages that in large measure explain the present vicissitudes of the fraternal countries and the origins of the present crisis.Despite many difficulties  steps are being taken to endorse the Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America. The recent meeting of ministers of foreign affairs of Central America and Contadora was quite beneficial in this respect and  without being overly optimistic  we believe that the conditions for progress are now present. And I venture to say this fully aware that  as if by magic  every time the Contadora meetings take a step forward  incidents or actions of various types take place in the region which are perhaps intended to undermine the results of those efforts for peace and reconciliation.It would be a regrettable paradox if  as we move closer to the signing of the Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America  we were to witness a systematic worsening of this type of hypocritical conduct.In any event  we Venezuelans shall not relent in this quest  since we are convinced that it is necessary to use dialog to oppose those who try to promote war and confrontation.Venezuela is committed to peace in Latin America and in the entire world. We are committed to promoting democracy  freedom  well-being and the defense of human rights.As we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  and 36 years after the signing of the Declaration of Human Rights  we see how the racist regime of South Africa persists in erecting a barrier to contain the will of a people that wishes  as is legitimately and humanly its due  to be master of its own destiny.Nelson Mandela's long imprisonment testifies to the tenacity of a brave and struggling people. It is at the same time  however  a sad symbol of our Organization's inability to end a universal problem that concerns us all.After so many years of repression backed by selfish interests and associations which have compromised and damaged the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations  we must without delay act resolutely and decisively to apply effective sanctions. A decisive outcome is required to end once and for all racism and the vestiges of colonialism.We have seen how some Governments are taking selective measures to induce the Pretoria Government to desist from its ignominious practices of racial segregation. But we insist that the firm will of important partners of South Africa is needed for sanctions to be really effective rather than simply an empty threat which only serves to spur on the racist Government to an intensified deployment of its powerful repressive apparatus. Nothing must stop us nor cause us to move backwards in the struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination.The fate of Namibia is closely linked with the racist practices institutionalized by South Africa. We are filled with regret at the fact that we are celebrating this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations without the presence of a delegation representing a free Namibia. Numerous major obstacles have been placed in the way of that wish  shared by the overwhelming majority of nations represented here. We wish to convey to the people of Namibia our solidarity and our support in its struggle to exercise its inalienable right to self-determination and independence.The struggle for human rights and freedom cannot be given up. In Latin America  we have in recent years succeeded in eliminating regimes and practices that were shameful for mankind. That task has not yet been completed. centers of arbitrariness  violence and injustice remain that gainsay the essence of the Latin American peoples and that often  like grotesque ghosts  strike blows reminiscent of a militaristic and arbitrary tradition. We cannot remain passive in the face of these situations.Thus far  the joint action of the nations represented in this forum has had to be to a large extent a reaction against destructive trends  unacceptable practices  the temptation to dominate and structural deformities. This has been an arduous and commendable task. But the moment may have come to make it more positive and effective  to demonstrate that this dialog can be devoted to stimulating the potential of mankind and not only to fighting against the violence and exploitation that still exist in much of our world.We call for the fulfillment of the objectives of the United Nations and ask for the participation of the military and economic Powers  which is fundamental  to encourage a new turn of events on the international scene  based on the practical application of the principles and purposes that we have set for ourselves. We want those initiatives that are in harmony with the collective outcry for a better world to be sponsored and supported within this Organization. We cannot allow this multilateral experience to be divided or weakened even when faced with intransigence and a lack of understanding. Nor can we allow irreversible conditions that make possible broader conflicts or the creation of distrust among the peoples represented here to prevail.We fully agree with the call for reflection and action made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in his report on the work of the United Nations  when he points out that""The Organization's function  and hence that of the Secretary-General  is therefore to harmonize  to encourage and to initiate. But the implementation  the drive  must come from the Members  when this drive does come  it can achieve remarkable results."" (A/40/1  p. 7)At one time  during the 1950s  when a terrible earthquake almost destroyed the city of Ambato in Ecuador  the powerful and resonant voice of a Latin American democrat  Enrique Rodriguez Fabregat of Uruguay  cried out under this same roof  ""Let us respond to this so-called act of nature with an act of man: let us help.""I was in Mexico some days ago to convey personally to President de la Madrid  on behalf of the people and Government of Venezuela  our solidarity with the Mexican people in this hour of sorrow and tribulation that has moved the entire international community and  at the same time  to convey our words of encouragement and our undiminished brotherly support. We therefore co-sponsored  with the greatest solicitude  the resolution unanimously adopted by the General Assembly regarding international help for Mexico.Beyond our efforts for world peace  freedom  human rights and social and economic development  we are confronted by a new enemy  perhaps the most dangerous of alls drugs. They are the Trojan horse of our civilization.In this theater of peace  I take the responsibility of calling for war  war against this scourge which is endangering the very health of our peoples and  above all  of our poorest  and therefore least protected  societies. And it is in this context that I am gratified to refer to the two resolutions on the subject approved by consensus during the last session  in the adoption of which Venezuela played an important role: one condemned the traffic in narcotics and the unlawful use of drugs and the other proposed the adoption of an international instrument to combat the problem in its new and devastating manifestations.As a corollary to this process  the Secretary-General of the United Nations has called for a meeting to be held at the ministerial level for the purpose of dealing with all aspects of the drug problem. We attach the greatest importance to this proposal.I must say very plainly that we must act simultaneously on the production  traffic and consumption of drugs. Only the co-ordinated actions of all countries can put an end to this tragic situation. Among the countries participating in this Assembly there are more than enough resources to do so. Clearly what is lacking  is the resolve to take the necessary heroic measures. I appeal to this Assembly: let us fight this war together.I could not conclude this message from the people and Government of Venezuela without paying tribute to those men who have devoted an important part of their lives - and have even given up their lives - in the service of the United Nations: Trygve Lie  Dag Hammarskjold  U Thant  Kurt Waldheim and Javier Perez de Cuellar  who  in the post of Secretary-General  have helped to establish the role of the Organization as an essential and irreplaceable instrument of co-operation andsolidarity among the peoples of the world. I also wish to pay tribute to a Venezuelan who has played an important part in the struggles of the United Nations since its early days  Manuel Perez Guerrero  a Minister in my Government  who was present at the birth of the United Nations in San Francisco  but who has unfortunately not been able to be with me during this session.I am particularly gratified to appear before this General Assembly  this democratic world  parliament  as a spokesman for the genuine feelings of the Venezuelan people  as President of the homeland of the Liberator Simon Bolivar  who foresaw an institution such as this one and who  by summoning the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama in 1826  helped to establish the foundations for the future development of the international Organization  designed to bring about a reconciliation of positions and co-operation with mutual respect among nations. By historical tradition and by deep-rooted conviction  we are firm believers in the enormous potential of the United Nations. And to believe in the United Nations is  above all  to trust in the intrinsic capacity of the human being to reconcile conflicting interests  harmonize different views and cultivate the fertile soil of understanding. He who has faith can move mountains. Let us make the effort; let us together set the world on the path towards a new  more just  more humane and more free civilization. The United Nations can do it."
"131",7392,"VNM",40,1985,"Mr. President  the delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam would like  at the very outset  to congratulate you most cordially and to wish you every success in your guidance of this historic session of the General Assembly.Permit me to express to the Government and people of Mexico the profound  sympathy and sincere condolences of the Government and people of Viet Nam for the heavy losses caused by the recent earthquake. We are convinced that with their undaunted will and with the assistance of the international community  the Mexican people will soon be able to overcome this severe trial.Today we have an opportunity to look back at the four decades of activities of the United Nations and to identify the crucial problems which call for common efforts by the entire international community.Forty million men  of whom 20 million were sons of the heroic Soviet people  laid down their lives for mankind's great victory  which ended the Second world War and led to the creation of the United Nations  the largest and most important of all international organizations. Since then  millions of others have sacrificed their lives to quench the flames of war kindled by imperialism throughout the world  and to wrest back independence and freedom and achieve social progress. Enormous human and material resources were needed to break the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and to establish a military and strategic equilibrium  thus enabling mankind to enjoy the longest period without a world war in this century.* These significant achievements  realized at the cost of priceless sacrifices  have served as the basis for the adoption of many useful resolutions at the United Nations. However  the struggle for a stable and lasting peace on earth  as well as the fight for independence  sovereignty and development of peoples  are far from ended. They have even grown more intense  given the self-evident fact that the imperialist and reactionary forces will never willingly renounce their designs of domination and exploitation of the world's peoples.Today  with the constant growth of the forces of national independence  peace and social progress  a real possibility has emerged  of which is becoming increasingly well-defined  preventing and gradually thwarting all attempts to provoke a new world war. However  given the insane calculations of the militarists and warmongers  the danger remains greater than ever of a war which would mean the wiping out of the human race. These forces remorselessly continue their arms race  particularly in the nuclear field  in a bid to destroy the strategic equilibrium. Even worse  under the deceitful label of the ""strategic defense initiative""  they have launched a program for extending the arms race into outer space  thus posing a new threat to the world's peoples.The struggle to stop the arms race on earth  as in outer space  is an issue of immediate significance and a priority for all peoples. Any action for peace  the independence and sovereignty of nations  democracy  well-being and social justice is inseparable from the common struggle to prevent a nuclear war. Along with its other constructive peace initiatives  the Soviet Onion's unilateral moratorium on all nuclear tests until the end of this year is a clear gesture of goodwill and an important contribution to international peace and security.In the past four decades Europe has gone through a long and complex process for the preservation of peace and the peaceful coexistence of the two opposing social systems  against all attempts by the imperialist forces to obliterate the socialist system that came into being following the Second world War. The fruit of this struggle was the signing in 1975 of the Helsinki Final Act  which defined the framework of peaceful coexistence. This was reaffirmed at the Madrid Conference in 1983. However  in view of the unalterable nature of imperialism  the struggle to consolidate peaceful coexistence in Europe continues and the problem of how to avert a nuclear conflagration the unavoidable consequence of which would be catastrophic for all mankind remains a burning issue.In the past four decades  notwithstanding the absence of a world war  the peoples of Asia have never known real peace. They have faced some of the longest and bloodiest wars in history and at the present moment Asia is one of the world's crisis areas owing to the policies of certain imperialist and militarist forces which are trying to turn Asia and the Pacific into an arena of political and military confrontation. Obviously  Asia still lacks a framework for peaceful coexistence but the premises thereof are taking shape; in the course of the past four decades the peoples of the continent have recorded successive victories in the struggle for national independence and social progress. Thus  the emergence of a balance of forces favorable to peace  radically changing the face of the world  irrespective of the intransigence of the imperialist and colonialist forces  has been possible. Long and complex though it may remain  the struggle for peaceful coexistence in Asia and the Pacific which is in keeping with the trend of our time  is bound to carry the day. In this regard  the Soviet Union's proposals on building mutual confidence in the Far East and on convening a body to discuss all questions relating to peace and security in Asia and the Pacific and Mongolia's initiative regarding the signing of a treaty of mutual non-aggression and the non-use of force in relations among States of Asia and the Pacific are seen to be truly realistic.During the past 40 years hundreds of millions of people of the oppressed nations have risen up to throw off the colonial yoke and win back their independence and freedom. In that heady atmosphere and acting in accordance with the general trend  the United Nations adopted  25 years ago  at its fifteenth session  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Later  many other important resolutions were adopted by the united Nations with the aim of affirming the right of all peoples to live in independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity and to adopt the political system of their choice. However  many peoples in Asia  Africa  Latin America and Oceania are still engaged in a fierce struggle to achieve and preserve these inalienable rights.The peoples of Central America and the Caribbean are struggling against the United states policy of aggression  which is directed especially at Cuba and Nicaragua  at maintaining colonialism in Puerto Rico and at suppressing the revolutionary movement in El Salvador and other progressive national movements. An expeditionary force was even used to invade Grenada. This policy has created tension  endangering the peace and stability of the region and prejudicing the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about a negotiated solution of the situation in Central America.The Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  and the South African people  under the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) are persevering in a long  arduous  and valiant struggle against the brutal domination of colonialism and apartheid and for the exercise of their right to genuine self-determination and independence. The front-line States are still constantly coping with acts and threats of aggression by certain imperialist forces and the racist regime of South Africa in order to defend their independence  sovereignty and security and to assert their right to contribute effectively to the fulfillment of mankind's desire for the elimination of the last stronghold of colonialism in that part of the world.The peoples of the Middle East are still engaged in a continuing fight against the Israeli Zionists and their masters  who are intensifying their policy of aggression against the Palestinian people and their attempts to undermine the latter's unity	the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian and Arabpeoples.Only a few days ago  in the course of this session of the General Assembly  a bombing raid was carried out by the Israeli Zionists against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters near Tunis and  almost simultaneously  an armed attack was launched against Angola by the South African racists. Both criminal acts stem from the same policy of State terrorism  which Viet Nam vehemently condemns.In Asia and the Pacific  the right to self-determination of small Territories such as Micronesia  and New Caledonia  has yet to be implemented.In the face of the attempt to create two Korean States and the continued presence of United States troops in South Korea  the Korean people are forced to continue their struggle to achieve the peaceful and sovereign reunification of their country.Despite their tremendous achievements in rehabilitating and developing their country  for some years to come the Kampuchean people will have to exert every effort to eliminate for ever the danger of a repetition of the genocide fostered by Peking.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is still confronting an undeclared war carried out by the agents of the forces of imperialism and big-nation hegemonism.As a people which has undergone 30 years of war against foreign aggression  and which for several years has been the target of a multi-faceted war of sabotage on the part of its northern neighbor  Viet Nam reserves its steadfast sympathy and vigorous support for the peoples of Asia  Africa  Latin America and Oceania in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism.Colonialism has been brought down. But the exploitation  oppression and domination of peoples are growing even worse under various forms of neo-colonialism. The struggle of the developing countries on the economic front is at this time a burning issue. Many resolutions adopted by the United Nations remain a dead letter while the national economies of the developing countries  burdened with enormous difficulties and colossal foreign debts  continue to deteriorate. Such a situation only further emphasizes the urgency of the struggle for a new international economic order.The Non-Aligned Movement evinces the determination and vitality of the peoples struggling against imperialism  colonialism and other reactionary forces  for peace  independence and development. The resolutions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement  particularly those adopted at the sixth and seventh summits and at the recent Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Luanda  meet the requirements of the situation and are in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam reiterates its endorsement of these resolutions and believes that they will receive the approval and support of the United Nations.At a time when the international community is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is commemorating its fortieth anniversary as well. Due to stonewalling by forces bent on turning back the clock  the first worker-peasant State in South-East Asia had to wait 32 years before it could become a Member of this Organization.However  during the past four decades  in their struggle for peace  independence  national reunification and socialism  the Vietnamese people  at the cost of their blood  and strengthened by the close solidarity of the international community and especially of the fraternal Lao and Kampuchean peoples  have foiled the greatest attempts made by the forces of colonialism  imperialism and international reaction to realize their schemes. Thus the Vietnamese people have powerfully contributed to building up the pressure of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism throughout the world.For the past six years  by making constant efforts and setting forth constructive peace initiatives which conform to the legitimate interests of the parties concerned  the three peoples of IndoChina have significantly contributed to thwarting the policy of confrontation and tension pursued by imperialist and reactionary forces. Consequently  a real possibility now exists for working out a framework for peaceful coexistence among States in South-East Asia  and between them and countries outside the region  and for building a South-East Asia of peace  stability and co-operation.Should an early political solution be reached  which would guarantee the security and sovereignty of all States and peoples in the region  including Kampuchea  the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese volunteer forces will be completed before the 1990 deadline  unilaterally decided upon by the Governments of Viet Nam and Kampuchea. The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  moreover  has declared its readiness to enter talks with the various groups and individuals in the opposition aimed at discussing the bringing about of national reconciliation based on the elimination of the Pol Pot clique  as well as the organization of general elections after the total withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteer forces from Kampuchea.We should add that the proposal advanced by Malaysia on talks was considered by the recent Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of three Indochinese countries to be an initiative worthy of being taken into consideration. Thus the conditions for a political solution to the problems in South-East Asia and in Kampuchea are steadily developing. In this endeavor to build a peaceful and secure South-East Asia  '  et Nam's national interests and those of the international community coincide. Viet Nam has done and will do its utmost to contribute to the success of this noble cause. At the same time  we welcome all joint efforts on the part of the countries concerned  as well as initiatives to this end wherever they may come from. We are pleased to note that the recent talks between Viet Nam  representing the three countries of Indochina  and Indonesia  representing the ASEAN countries  have yielded positive results  notwithstanding certain differences. These talks have paved the way for a process of substantive dialog on an equal footing  in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual concern for each other's legitimate interests  and on a basis of equality  with neither side imposing its views on the other and without interference from Powers external to the region  with a view to reaching an equitable solution to the questions of South-East Asia. We wish to thank friendly countries for their encouragement of a dialog undertaken in this spirit. At the same time  we deplore the fact that a great Power persists in impeding this policy of dialog  even though this policy is already proving to be a failure.We most particularly appreciate the positive contribution of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the search for a political solution in the interests of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia. We are equally appreciative of the valuable and effective economic and technical assistance given by the United Nations and its specialized agencies to our work of national construction.On the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the Vietnamese delegation warmly salutes the contributions of this Organization to international peace and security and to the independence  freedom and happiness of the peoples of the world. In the future  despite numerous difficulties and complexities which remain  based on the strength of the achievements of the revolutionary movements and of the forces of peace  the United Nations will undoubtedly make an even more important contribution to the interests of the international community."
"132",7426,"VUT",40,1985,"The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations represents a historic milestone for all mankind. This is less  a time for celebration of what we have achieved and more a time for reflection on and rededication to our sometimes forgotten ideals.Your selection  Sir  to preside over this session of the General Assembly is a well-deserved tribute to your integrity and your diplomatic skills. It is also a tribute to your country  which you have faithfully represented here at the United Nations for so many years. We applaud your selection and the much-deserved honor bestowed upon you and Spain.We also commend your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka of Zambia  for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties. All of us were the beneficiaries of his exceptional abilities and his dignified manner. For this  we shall always be grateful.We are also grateful to the host country and the host city for the manner in which we have been received. Many people have worked very hard to ensure the comfort and safety of the various delegations represented here today. We appreciate the patience  understanding and goodwill of the people of this great nation and this great city. The presence of so many Heads of State or Government here at the same time has not been easy to manage  but all involved have done a commendable job. The general public  representatives of the various city  state and federal agencies  and the members of the united Nations Secretariat have all earned our thanks. I trust that this same teamwork and spirit of co-operation will in the future symbolize the international community's relationship with the City of New York.The Secretary-General of our Organization has earned a reputation for candor and objectivity. His analytical and thought-provoking annual report enhances that much-deserved reputation. As he has so capably pointed out  the question before us now  as always  is""not so much the future of the United Nations as the future of humanity and ofour planet and the role of the United Nations in that future"".(A/40/1  para. 1)The opening of this session has  in some quarters  generated an almost unprecedented interest in the Organization. The news media and general citizenry of countries which have in recent years been indifferent to the United Nations seem to have a heightened sense of awareness of some of the items on our agenda. Our day-to-day worn still does not capture much of their attention  but at least this session seems to have generated some interest in our work  one might have to go back to the early sixties  or even to the inception of the United Nations  to recall a comparable level of interest.Unfortunately  interest in an event does not always bring with it knowledge or understanding of the various perspectives on a substantive question. One of the challenges we face is how we can transform the interest in this event  the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the. United Nations  into a broader knowledge of and appreciation for the substantive work of this Organization.There are cynics who do not believe that the United Nations serves any useful purpose. There are some people who feel that what good the united Nations does is outweighed by waste and inefficiency  divisive political debates and strident rhetoric. There are others who know better  but because the United Nations no longer serves their interests to the extent it once did  they deliberately distort and misrepresent the history of this Organization  and they seldom miss an opportunity to smear its good name.No legislative body anywhere in the world is without its critics. This is true of legislative bodies in big countries and small  and in new States and older  more-established states which call themselves democracies. Criticism itself is healthy and can be a constructive tool for development and advancement. It can also be a dishonest effort to intimidate rather than reform.The united Nations is perhaps easier to criticize because  although it has the appearance of a legislative body  it does not have the powers of a legislative body. Those who wish to prolong a political crisis know that the United Nations cannot enforce its will without the co-operation of its Members. Thus  it does not make sense to maintain  as some do  that the United Nations has not been able to solve any of the world's major political problems.As are all know  and as the Secretary-General has restated ""The United Nations cannot - and was not intended to - solve all the problems of the international community ..."" (A/40/1  para. 9) We created an imperfect Organization. Our own sovereign rights as individual nations limit the scope and effect of our decisions as the United Nations. If we wish to create a stronger Organization - one which has an ability to implement its decisions - it is up to us to do so.That is not a new theme. Everyone here knows that it is true  even though some do not wish to admit it. On the other hand  all of us know that the united Nations has managed to accomplish a great deal in other  very important areas.Today  millions of people have homes to live in and food to eat because of the work of the specialized agencies of the united Nations. Millions of people can read and write and see the irreplaceable treasures of their own cultures because of the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Millions of people no longer fear certain diseases because of the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Racism and colonialism are no longer acceptable modes of international behavior  thanks in part to the united Nations.Are not these things that we should all be proud of? Why is it that some among us can take pride only in how many people they are capable of killing or maiming in a few short seconds? Why is it that some among us can take pride only in how many material possessions they have in relation to how few others have? Why is it that some among us can take pride only in competing with nature's ability to destroy rather than with nature's ability to create?This year  more than ever before. Millions of people are hoping and praying that we  the leaders of the world  will come to our senses and hear what they have been saying. Host people do not want to hear fancy words and unfulfilled proHises. Most people do not want to live in fear and with uncertainty and insecurity. They want us to listen as well as talk to each other. They want us to reason together and devise ways to ensure that this generation leaves a world for the next generation to inherit. They want us to assure then that the stars above us will continue to be for lovers to gaze at  for thinkers to ponder over  and for scientists to explore - but not a place to store the instruments of war.Every year the opening of the general debate generates a great deal of anxiety and anticipation here at the headquarters building  and in most of our capitals. The first few days of the debate are usually highly charged and full of great expectations. Everyone seems to wait breathlessly for new pronouncements on the problems of the world. This is particularly true when the pronouncements are being made by the larger  more powerful countries  which have the ability to affect those problems. As the debate continues  however  and smaller countries take the rostrum  the interest of the opinion-makers seems to flag. They say that the speeches take on a strident and familiar tone. To them  each day seems to be a little bit less dramatic than the one before  and unless a new crisis arises  or a highly visible personality arrives on the scene  they lose interest and direct the public's attention elsewhere.Thus  when at this historic session the President of Tanzania  Mr. Julius K. Nyerere  addressed the General Assembly for the last time  the public's attention was indeed directed elsewhere. President Nyerere is one of the most respected figures of this century. His has always been an articulate and reasonable voice for the discriminated against  the disadvantaged  and the disenfranchised of this world. We of the developing countries treasure him as one of our elder statesmen. We shall miss him hers at the General Assembly.I know that I speak for many others when I applaud his words and say that his last address deserved far better coverage by the news media  what more persuasive evidence can be presented on behalf of the need for a new international information order?Ironically* while this historic session marked Mwalimu's last address to us as President of Tanzania  it also marked the first address to the General Assembly by one of the developing world's younger statesmen  Mr. Alan Garcia  President of Peru. The symbolism of this coincidence should be noted.(toe is a son of Africa  the other is a son of South America. Both of them spoke for others as well as the people of their native lands  and both belong to us all. Both had the courage and conviction to address difficult subjects with imagination and originality. Both electrified this hall when they spoke.I cite these two addresses as examples of the careful thought and analysis every nation has brought to this session.Mr. Jose Sarney  President of Brazil  set the tone for us with his stimulating opening address. Each successive speaker has placed his own unique signature on our dialog. He only hope that the message is being received and will be given careful consideration.Who better to remind us of the very nature of our international democracy  and of our responsibility vigorously to oppose the apartheid regime of south Africa than President Nyerere? Who better to illustrate to us the perils of the illicit drug trade  addictive monetary policies  and an equally addictive arms race than President Garcia  representing a small developing country whose democracy is threatened by all three?Vanuatu is  as members of the Assembly are aware  a very small developing country situated in a region that some delegates might not often think of as they ponder the great issues of the day. There are  however  some facts about our region that should be borne in mind  particularly on this  the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.In 1945 most of the current Members of this international community were colonies. Our region was no exception. Our people were exploited  undereducated and socially segregated in our own land  as were most colonized peoples. Although we ourselves were not among the rich and powerful of this earth  our region was fiercely contested during the Second World War. Veterans of that fighting insist that it was the most. intense of any combat anywhere in the world.One of the nations of our region had  on a per capita basis  the highest number of men in uniform  the highest number of men in combat overseas  and the highest number of casualties. When the United Nations was formed  this nation and another frost our region were considered by sons to be the spokesmen for the small countries  the reason being  of course  that other smaller countries were still colonies.We ourselves  although still a colony during the war  remained loyal to the allied cause when one of our colonizers was occupied by the forces of fascism and the Vichy government established. When that country was liberated by allied forces we shared in the joy of its people  even though we ourselves were still a colony.When the war ended  we watched with amazement as millions of dollars worth of material and equipment  some of which we could still use today  was dumped into the ocean or otherwise destroyed. We  of course  did not understand such waste.We also heard the mighty roar and saw the terrible flashes of nuclear bombs as the land  the seas  and the whole environment of our region were used to test new  more powerful weapons of destruction. Peace had cone  we were told  but our environment knew no peace.Today  our environment still knows no peace. One of our former colonizers -the same one whose own liberation we fought for and cheered - continues to test itsnuclear weapons in our environment. It tells us that these tests are safe and that we are free to come and inspect the test sites for ourselves. It ignores our moralobjections to nuclear weaponry.He note that there is no conclusive scientific evidence that these tests are safe. Even if they were  we would still oppose the use of our region for the testing of these weapons. If the tests are so safe  let them be conducted on the land of the testing country. Then there will not even be a need for us to be invited to inspect the test sites.The nation that continues to test those nuclear weapons in our region is also the nation that continues to Maintain a colonial presence in our region. The two policies go hand in hand.An independent New Caledonia would not be a support base for nuclear testing in the South Pacific. We doubt that an independent French Polynesia would be the site of nuclear tests.We are told that these tests and visits to our ports and waters by nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered vessels are necessary to help defend us and our way of life. At this point  we wonder if our would-be defenders even understand our way of life. In our innocence  we have always believed that freedom Beans that the people of a particular society are free to make their own decisions. If we do not wish to be defended with nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels  our wishes should be respected.Ours is a parliamentary democracy  we follow the will of our people and not the will of others our people never elected. The people of the South Pacific have chosen to reject nuclear weaponry  which we all have a very strong reason to detest. We appeal to those who have it within their power to free our children from the fear of nuclear tests to respect our wishes and to do so. Their failure to do so will not lead us to change our position  but it may lead us to change our belief in their sincerity.This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. One of the greatest achievements of the united Nations is that the process of decolonization is now almost completed. The United Nations is now an almost universal international body.Unfortunately  some do not like that. To them  smaller countries such as ours should be seen - primarily by tourists - and rarely heard. The sane voices that did not want to extend the right to vote to all of the people in their own countries now decry the spread of international democracy and the right of all nations to have an equal vote in the world body.We are told that the size of a nation's financial contribution should determine its influence here at the United Nations. This is an interesting proposition that deserves closer examination. Let us not for the moment even examine how and from what and where the wealth of the wealthy nations was created. After all  we must not dwell on the past  what is interesting about the proposition is the fact that by extending the argument we would have a situation where nations that now consider themselves democratic would be encouraged to give greater weight to the votes or opinions of their wealthiest taxpayers. Perhaps some nations do this already. I do not know. This is not  however  our notion of democracy  and it is not what we do in Vanuatu.Another fact to be considered is that there are different ways to measure contributions to the United Nations. Based on contributions as a proportion of gross national product  Vanuatu is the largest contributor to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system. Should we  therefore  insist that  unless nations vote the way we want  we will reduce our contribution? Should we now demand a weighted voting system in the General Assembly? I think not.Yes  decolonization has changed the United Nations. We think it is a change for the better. It now more accurately reflects the thinking of most of the world's people. And  after all  is it not true that one of the things we most abhor about apartheid the fact that the Government of South Africa does not reflect the thinking of most of that country's people? If we cannot accept the principle of one nation  one vote here  then how can we champion one person  one vote in South Africa  or elsewhere?In any event  let us leave those who are troubled by our present democracy to ponder how they night turn back the clock a century. The rest of us have some unfinished business to attend to in this century.In our region  the people of Hew Caledonia want their independence. The neighboring States of the South Pacific Forum support the right of the people of Hew Caledonia to determine their own future and to be an independent nation. The foreign ministers of the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement also support that right.To its credit  the administering Power has taken some constructive steps in the process of decolonization  but a great deal more remains to be done  particularly in the face of provocations by extremist elements within the settler population. Those settlers hope that their militancy and their lawlessness can coerce the administering Power into a failure to fulfill its commitment and its duty to facilitate that decolonization process.In the face of those dangerous provocations New Caledonia's colonized people  the Kanaks  have been remarkably restrained and conciliatory. At the same time they refuse to deviate from the path of self-determination-and independence.The recent elections held in New Caledonia demonstrated the depth of the feelings of the indigenous people that they be allowed to assert their own identity and reclaim their own country. The elections also showed that the settlers are  at this point  determined to remain French. It is they  and not the colonized people or the administering Power  that have drawn the battle line in Hew Caledonia. It is they  and not the indigenous people or the metropolitan Power  that constitute a clear and present danger to the peace and security of our region. Therefore  it is now time for the United Nations to be seized of this problem and to assist in assuring a peaceful but speedy transition to independence.What distinguishes New Caledonia from other colonial situations in the south Pacific is a recognition by the administering Power that the status quo cannot continue. The administering Power has not yet made such a clear determination with respect to its other colonies in the South Pacific. However we expect that eventually it will.Unfortunately there is in our region a disguised colonialism as well. That problem is proving to be much More difficult to. address.Too many Members of this international community believe that colonialism is an evil policy of European States only. Too many of us do not believe that a third world country that is itself a former colony can be expansionist. None of us want to believe that a country we admire for its anti-colonial past would succumb to the temptation to attempt the annexation of smaller  more vulnerable neighbors. However  this is exactly what has happened in our region  and on more than one occasion  we fear that it might even happen again.East Timor was never a part of Indonesia and its people were never asked whether they wanted to be Indonesians. If  as Indonesia claims. East Timor's people are happy with the current state of affairs  why is that territory still closed to outside observers  and why does the military resistance of the Maubere people continue?Fortunately for East Timor's people  the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have now been permitted some access to the territory. This access  however  is still very limited and tightly restricted. That there is any access at all is due primarily to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and a bi-partisan group of members of the United States Congress. We commend their efforts  and thank them for acting when others did nothing.We are encouraged by the negotiations between Portugal  the Administering Power  and Indonesia  the occupying Power. However  we feel that nothing of substance can be negotiated without the participation of the representatives of the people of East Timor.The situation in Bast Timor is not on the General Assembly's agenda this year  and there will not be a resolution on that subject for us to consider. However  this does not mean that the plight of the people of that country should be forgotten or ignored. Most of the nations represented here will never permit that to occur.It is true that we have a very long agenda  and each year it seems to grow longer. Some of the problems even appear incapable of resolution  perhaps this is because in some instances in the past  some meters of the international community were unaware of what was happening in other parts of the world. Others simply chose to excuse or ignore the type of abuse which is now occurring in East Timor.The colonial histories of East Timor and West Papua were different. The political climate at the time that each was annexed was also different  as were the social conditions that existed in each country. However  had enough voices been raised when West Papua's people were denied the right to make their own choice  perhaps the rights of East Timor's people would not have been trampled upon.By now  iiiJ8t people have forgotten what happened in west Papua. Its people have not. Every day we in that region are ourselves reminded by them. Indonesia wishes we would forget. We wish that we could. However  only Indonesia can make us forget  and not by calling us names  but by permitting those Melanesian people to decide freely for themselves who they are and what they want to be.We sometimes look at what the earth possesses and wonder why greed and avarice drive some men to treat others as sub-humans. What is it that drives some to fear and despise others because they look different  sound different  or maintain different religious or political beliefs? All over our globe this seems to be the case.The late W. E. B. DuBois once said:""The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line ..."" He was right  and nowhere is this more evident than in southern Africa.Long after other societies have come to grips with their own racial contradictions. South Africa continues to believe that every man  woman and child should be judged by the color of his or her skin. Long after other societies have realized that it is not even in their best economic interests to maintain such outdated notions South Africa continues  when it comes to racial attitudes  to live not even in the 19th century  but in the 18th century.Forty years after the death of Adolf Hitler and the demise of his brand of fascism  his heirs exercise State power in Pretoria and masquerade as a respectable Government. Why do we tolerate this? How can anyone call that State a friend? What do those who call that Government a friend have in common with it? Please tell us; we should like to know.I will not go any further  not here today. I simply state that my Government is prepared to support army concrete measures that the United Nations may adopt to oppose that illegally constituted and illegally maintained regime. Comprehensive international action is required. Partial or selective measures will not work; They will only permit and encourage South Africa bo export the impact of those measures to those front-line States it holds as economic hostage. Disengagement from South Africa must be followed by comprehensive constructive involvement with the front-line States and those south Africans who are trying to free their country.Some may wonder why Vanuatu  a small country in the South Pacific  is so passionate on the subject of South Africa. Those who wonder do not know much about our own history. Although we are far removed geographically from the centers of world conflict  we are not an island unto ourselves. In the 19th century  our country was depopulated by slave traders who took many of our own people to work for them in other countries. Our country was also depopulated by the purposeful introduction of diseases from which we had no immunity.In a relatively short period of time our population was reduced from over 1 million people to considerably fewer than 100 000. He knew genocide before the world knew the word.That is why we will never accept any form of racism no matter what it is called. That is why we join with others who express the hope that just a portion of the massive sums of money spent on armaments could instead be spent on research on cancer  heart disease  sickle-cell anemia and the newest deadly killer  AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). That is. why we associate ourselves with those who have spoken out so forcefully against the illicit production  transportation and consumption of drugs. The drug traffic is to us the new slave trade  turning so many promising youths into useless  but dangerous  zombies.Even though we are geographically far removed from the major population centers of the world  we know how far and how fast a deadly disease can spread. He know how quickly organized crime can corrupt any society and erode the sovereignty of its people.Our region is one which is very susceptible to earthquakes and hurricanes. He ourselves suffered the crippling effects of a severe hurricane earlier this year. It caused considerable damage to our economy. He are now recovering slowly but surely. Host of bur neighbors have also been victimized by very bad hurricanes in the last few years  particularly Fiji. Thus  we understand the suffering of the people of Mexico; we comprehend the full nature of their tragedy  and we mourn with them.Developing countries are always more vulnerable to natural disasters because our economies are more fragile. He have fewer resources to begin with and therefore less to call on when these disasters strike. The disaster relief assistance of the developed world is always welcome and appreciated. However  we often wonder why it takes a disaster to mobilize massive international aid and co-operation.How many people would have been saved in Africa  and for how much less money  if proper development assistance had been provided beforehand and effectively directed? How many more calamities can we avert in the future by taking a long  hard look today at the economic practices which lead to unequal levels of development and weak national infrastructures? Is it not better for us to sit down together now and plan for the future than merely to wait to react to the next disaster?International co-operation must in the near future become much more than a phrase or slogan. The future well-being of this planet demands that we pull together. The United nations may not be perfect  but it is all that we have. It is up to us  all of us  to make the next 40 years better than the first 40.One area we can start in is that of the law of the sea. The almost limitless resources of the sea-bed give us an opportunity to demonstrate that mankind is not by nature selfish. There is plenty for everyone  and there is an international treaty that recognizes and codifies that fact.Why then have some chosen to act separately? What is there to gain? The rest of us have demonstrated our willingness to negotiate and assign importance to their capital and their technology. What else can we do? What else do they want us to do? We hope that reason will prevail and that before long the entire community of nations will sign in this painstakingly negotiated and drafted Convention and work within its confines to make it a success.As a developing small island State  in the South Pacific  we have a great deal at stake in that treaty  as in all other forms of International co-operation. Thus  we welcome the negotiations towards concluding a multilateral access treaty between the States of our region and the United States. He hope that the resulting regime will lead to a more equitable arrangement for the development of fisheries in our region. He will  however  always be faithful to the long-tern development needs of our own people and to our international commitments.The United Nations is a young Organization and most of its Members are young States. He are one of its youngest. The concept of international democracy is itself young  and still developing. Occasionally  the international community may even make mistakes  but that is one of the costs of democracy. Consider the alternative. Reflect back to what we left behind only 40 short years ago.He have come a long way  and we have a lot further to go  but we can only make the journey together - all of us  large and small  developed and developing. North and South  East and west.Debate and disagreement are healthy and will help us on our journey so long as we maintain an ability to engage in dialog and to respect each other's points of view. It is wrong to try to judge us by whether or not we always agree with each other or with any one of the Members. After ail  who is to say that any one of the Members is the one that is always right?Families do not always agree  and we are a family of nations. However  there are a few items on our agenda about which we are all in agreement. Let us give our Organization a birthday gift of our collective resolve to support our Secretary-General in his efforts to move those items forward.Let us welcome Namibia to our ranks as an independent State. Let us end apartheid once and for all. Let us engage in meaningful global negotiations. Let us commit our resources to the elimination  of poverty  illiteracy and disease. Let us convene a global conference on drug trafficking and drug abuse  as proposed by the Secretary-General. Let us support the Contadora process. Let us stop building weapons of mass destruction. Let us pledge not to destroy the world before the next generation has a change to make it a better world. Finally  let us work to strengthen rather than undermine the United Nations."
"133",7460,"WSM",40,1985,"It gives the Samoan delegation the greatest satisfaction  Sir  to see a President of your stature presiding over this session  a session of very special significance to us all - the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Your long years of superlative service have earned you and your country the highest honor and respect  and we welcome your presidency. It is also our pleasure to express our thanks to Ambassador Paul Lusaka for guiding us through the thirty-ninth session with a combination of warmth and wisdom. His diplomatic skill and generous good humor stood us in good stead throughout the session.Our thoughts and prayers have been with Mexico and its people since the tragic disaster they suffered so recently  and we join with others who have spoken before us in offering them our sincere condolences. May God be with them in this time of trial.Over the past 40 years of United Nations history  one of the pleasing developments has been the growth and the expansion of the role of the Secretary-General. The Secretaries-General have made major contributions to international peace and security and to the growth of the United Nations  and we and the world have been fortunate in the quality of the men who have held that office. Though their work of quiet and difficult diplomacy has often been behind the scenes and thus unsung  in this year of reflection those tireless and dedicated efforts should not be forgotten.It is very appropriate that at this time of reckoning for our Organization  we have a Secretary-General who is not only tireless in his pursuit of the principles we espouse  but whose forceful vision provides us with in-depth analyses of our Organization  in his annual reports and elsewhere  and with careful guidelines  which we will do well to heed if we are to improve on our past performance. In his 1982 report the Secretary-General commented that:""The United Nations itself has been unable to play as effective and decisive a role as the Charter ... envisaged for it."" (A/37/1  p. 1) We feel that the main reason for this has been some lack of respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter. To us it is important that this respect be restored.These principles - such as the sovereign equality of all Members  the universality of membership  the territorial integrity of States  the non-use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of peoples to self-determination -are of profound importance to us and small States like us. Small island developing countries  with their sometimes fragile economies  often take a buffeting from political and economic forces beyond their control and perhaps feel - to quote a Samoan proverb - like birds battling against the wind. 'Thus we maintain our faith in the united Nations and in the commitment to a strong and secure international order  which is the best guarantee of our security  and we believe that together we can work towards the solution of our problems and the improvement of the lot of our peoples. We increasingly see the importance of the Charter's principles in our region as the threats of a shrinking world seem to be encroaching.Samoa is compelled to voice in this forum its continuing concern and heightened alarm at the actions and policies of certain nations with regard to certain activities and events under their control within the South Pacific region.The Pacific peoples have declared unequivocally their opposition to nuclear testing in their region. Whatever reasons are cited to justify or legitimate French authority to conduct these tests  the fact is that it is the people who live in the area that are taking the risks associated with these dangerous experiments. No assurances can assuage us  and no safety precautions can be adequate safeguard against the possibility of damage to the fragile environment on which Pacific peoples depend so heavily  to say nothing of unknown dangers that may become apparent only in years to come.Total disregard by France of the expressed opposition of the Pacific peoples continues to be a source of agitation and frustration in the region. Moreover  it is leading directly to the appearance in the region of disturbances and ugly acts of international sabotage and violence  activities that up to now have had no place in the South Pacific during peacetime  in fact since the Second World War. Therefore the area literally is being contaminated physically and morally by the selfish preoccupations of France  thousands of miles from its own shores.Uncertain progress in the decolonization of New Caledonia similarly contains the seeds of disruption and danger for the region. Samoa supports the South Pacific Forum in its call for self-determination and the early transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the innate rights and aspirations of the indigenous people and in such a manner as to guarantee the rights and interests of all committed inhabitants of this multiracial society.We call on France to take the necessary steps that would confirm beyond doubt its commitment to advancing New Caledonia along a meaningful path to self-determination. Electoral reforms  in our view  would constitute a vital element of such a display of commitment.We hope that the positive elements that have emerged in French decisions on New Caledonia will be consistently pursued and we call on all parties to refrain from further violence and to engage in a constructive dialog to bring about a peaceful and lasting resolution of New Caledonia's present problems. We are used to peaceful decolonization in our region and to a pattern of energetic co-operation between Administering Powers and the colonized to achieve the high objectives of the United Nations Charter and those of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we look to France to play a full role in the decolonization of New Caledonia and in initiating meaningful progress.A pleasing development in our region is the decision of the United States to negotiate a regional fisheries agreement with the South Pacific island nations. We are hopeful that this agreement will resolve any past differences to our mutual benefit.The problems of regions close to ours remain of great concern to us. Foreign forces remain in Democratic Kampuchea and in Afghanistan  and must be withdrawn to enable solutions to be found in which the peoples of those strife-torn countries may participate and finally be enabled to return to a normal way of life.With regard to the Kampuchean situation  we applaud the efforts of the Association of South East Asian Nations to create conditions favorable to negotiations  and the good offices of Indonesia and Malaysia in this regard. We also support the Secretary-General in his efforts in seeking a solution  and our hope is that agreement on negotiations can be reached swiftly.We are encouraged that the proximity talks on Afghanistan under the Secretary-General's auspices are continuing. We fully support this process and we hope to see it result in the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible.With respect to the Korean peninsula  we feel that encouragement of the talks between the North and the South is an essential step towards the reduction of tensions  and it is pleasing that there has been movement towards more dialogue. We understand that the Republic of Korea wishes to become a full Member of the United Nations. Indeed  we believe the achievement of universality to be a principle of such cardinal importance to our Organization that we should always be ready to respect the aspirations of those who would join us as members. Thus we would support accession for all those countries that wish it and that are prepared to abide by the principles of the Charter. We feel the Republic of Korea fulfills these requirements.Further afield  but also of concern to us  are the conflicts in the Middle East. In the past months we have seen new initiatives and proposals on theArab-Israeli conflict that seem to present opportunities for negotiation  and wehad hoped to see some positive movement. It is disappointing  therefore  that there has been a lack of positive response. We are also dismayed at the understandably heightened tensions in the region resulting from the recent Israeli raid on Tunisian territory  while deploring international terrorism in whatever form and wherever it might occur  we can see absolutely no excuse for Israel's attack on another sovereign country and indeed a country of long and honorable commitment to the principles of this Organization. We deplore it as not only a violation of international law but also extremely detrimental to the peace process in the region.The situation in Lebanon and the Iran-Iraq war continue to sadden us with their tragic fratricidal struggles. We would ask those who continue to fuel these conflicts by interference or arms sales to cease these activities which  as they are well aware  worsen the conflicts and make the easing of tensions that much more difficult.The iniquitous apartheid system has always contained within it the seeds of its own doom. The alarmingly increased tensions in South Africa  resulting in escalating violence and destruction  portend that this end might be calamitous indeed if the South African Government does not at last heed the multitudinous warnings it has received. South Africa's perversity in refusing to pursue the path of racial partnership in any but the most devious manner is bringing down on it the rightful wrath of the international community. There can be no more delays. Samoa is prepared to endorse all positive measures which will lead to the full participation of all the people of South Africa in its Government.Similarly  in Namibia South Africa's delays and prevarications have for too long tried international patience. These must cease.Unfortunately  these past weeks have seen increasing tensions in many parts of the world that could lead to dark days ahead; but there is a glimmer of hope in one area at least. The summit meeting between the super-Powers presents an opportunity to return to a detente that could lessen world tensions considerably. It is a moment of opportunity that must be grasped  as it may not come again. A breakthrough in arms control must be made now before the technology on both sides becomes too sophisticated to allow for verification procedures. He urge the United States and the Soviet Union to give the world a break. The Secretary-General put it well when he asked  ""By what right do they decide the fate of humanity?"" In the disarmament and other forums of the United Nations  the rest of humanity  through its Governments  must make it clear that they  the super-Powers  have no right to continue endangering the peoples of the world and that we expect an end to posturing and a genuine and responsible effort to agree on a real reduction of their loathsome arsenals.That will lead others to join the process so that it becomes multilateral. Disarmament? especially nuclear disarmament  must be a multilateral process  for  the effects of a nuclear holocaust will be felt by the farthest of us - when whales fight  the kraken wakes; and when the nuclear monster is unleashed there will be no stopping it. Not only must existing nuclear armaments be reduced and eventually destroyed  but weapons production must cease and the spread of these weapons be stemmed. To effect this we urge  as did all non-nuclear-weapon States at the recent non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference  the urgent completion of the comprehensive test-ban treaty to prohibit all testing in all environments for all time; and we also stress the absolute necessity of universal and strict adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. We are encouraged by China's decision to join the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and also to participate in work on the comprehensive test-ban treaty when it is begun in the Conference on Disarmament and we would urge others to follow suit.The deep concern of our region regarding nuclear questions has recently been demonstrated by the unanimous endorsement of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty by the South Pacific Forum Heads of Government. This Treaty prohibits the manufacture  testing  stationing or use of nuclear explosives in the South Pacific. It was opened for signature  significantly on Hiroshima Day  6 August  and it is an embodiment of the desire of the South Pacific peoples to live in a Pacific where our sunny skies are not darkened by nuclear winter and our seas not sullied with nuclear sludge. This zone  along with the adjoining zones covered by the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the Antarctic Treaty  demonstrates the wishes of a significant section of the southern hemisphere to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and live free of their threat. We are pleased that there are similar proposals in other parts of the world  in particular that of our ASEAN neighbors. We would hope that in due course the nuclear States will become party to the relevant protocols to the Treaty.In conclusion we wish to reaffirm our faith in the United Nations and renew our commitment to the Charter and its principles. In reflecting on the past 40 years  what the cynics and detractors should bear in mind is how the world might have been without the United Nations It is hard to imagine now a world without a multilateral forum that provides a neutral meeting place for countries with differences where they can meet privately  away from public pressures; a forum not only for discussion of international issues  but where countries with few missions abroad can meet in friendly surroundings with other countries and with international aid officials; a forum where countries have to defend their actions  but also have the opportunity to exchange views and vent frustrations. It is also hard to imagine the world without the quiet diplomacy and good offices of a respected and objective international figure like the Secretary-General and without peacekeeping forces to create conditions for fostering peace. Without these the world could be a lot more menacing place with less freedom and fewer rights for individuals.We have only to imagine how different every-day life would be if the United Nations had never existed to see how its effects have reached down to the roots of our societies  however remote they are. There would have been no institutions to sponsor the international meetings that have so raised global consciousness and had far-reaching practical effects; conferences like  for instance  the recent successful women's conference in Nairobi; and many more. There is hardly a country on this globe that has not benefited from United Nations sponsored programs in the field of air safety  public health  drug abuse control and environmental protection  to list but a few. Imagine the world without the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) with its technical assistance partnership; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) with its agricultural assistance; the World Health Organization (WHO) with its world-wide early warning system  its inoculation teams and its elimination of smallpox; the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) with its family-planning and census assistance; the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) with its cultural and educational programs; the united Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with its hope-giving children's survival revolution; and the united Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with his aid to the homeless and displaced. Also the parallel activities of the finance institutions -the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  which promote economic stability  orderly development and long-term growth. Without all these  the world could be a great deal more miserable with more pollution  disease and disaster.Much has had to be omitted from this summary  but it is worth reminding ourselves how much of positive worth has been achieved by the United Nations and how much is now taken for granted. Therefore  let us more forward to the future  not brooding over the past  but building on those achievements of which the United Nations can be justly proud."
"134",7501,"YEM",40,1985,"Mr. President  allow me at the outset to express on my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic most heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at this historic session  which coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the foundation of our international Organization. We are confident that  thanks to your wide experience and skill  you will be able to fulfill the tasks of this session in such a competent manner as to guarantee the positive results to which we all aspire and to meet the challenges faced by the international community. I wish to aspire you that my delegation and I will spare no effort in co-operating with you and contributing to the success of the session and the achievement of its goals.I wish  through you  to express great appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Paul Lusaka  President of the last session  for his well known ability  wisdom and expertise with which he conducted its proceedings.I should also like to express our sincere appreciation of the continuing efforts made by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  to find just solutions to the international problems and crises faced by our world. We wish to convey to him our heartfelt gratitude for his report on the work of the Organization during the last year.Three years ago our country experienced a terrible earthquake which had extremely destructive consequences  so it is natural that we should sympathize with the anguish of the friendly Republic of Mexico as a result of the recent earthquakes that it suffered. In view of the great tragedy which has befallen it  we wish  in the name of the leaders  the Government and the people of the Yemen Arab Republic  to convey our sincere sympathy and condolences to Mexico  its leaders and courageous people. We appeal to the international community tospare no effort in assisting the friendly people of Mexico to overcome the consequences of the heart-rending ordeal which has befallen it.We are all aware of developments in international relations. We live today in a world where anxiety and disturbances prevail  where relations among nations are characterized by tension and lack of trust. The international situation is replete with complexities and risks. As a result of the increasing number of instances of recourse to force as a method of resolving disputes and conflicts  to say nothing of the frantic escalation of the race to produce  possess and deploy nuclear weapons - even in outer space - we are also threatened by an extension of the threat posed by nuclear weapons.We hope that the long awaited meeting between the two super-Powers  to be held next November  will pave the way for detente in international relations and curb the dangerous nuclear arms race. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  the Yemen Arab Republic  proceeding from its position of principle that calls for the achievement of peace and security in the world  maintains that the proliferation of these distressing phenomena and their implications for international relations are matters which constitute a comprehensive threat  not only to the States concerned  but also to international peace and security  and which are fraught with ominous and terrible consequences for the very existence of mankind.As a result of this awareness  my country associates itself with other States which call for the cessation of the arms race and a limitation of the production of nuclear weapons  a halt to nuclear weapons tests and to programs for the militarization of outer space  as a prelude to the elimination of all nuclear weapons and their stockpiles once and for all. At the same time  it emphasizes the need to return to the negotiating table to discuss complete disarmament in a responsible and constructive manner with a view to preserving civilization. My country supports all efforts aimed at the prevention of the use of nuclear weapons as well as the commitment by States not to be the first to use such weapons  just as it supports a freeze on those weapons  whether unilateral  bilateral or multilateral.The Yemen Arab Republic has always advocated that disputes and conflicts should be resolved in a peaceful manner  without recourse to the threat or use of force. As we are marking the fortieth anniversary of the foundation of our Organization  this may be an ideal opportunity to recall the tragedies brought about by the terrible and destructive Second world War  when the world did not possess these enormous arsenals of sophisticated nuclear weapons that it has now. We are therefore under a duty to consider in a serious and responsible manner the destiny of mankind and ways of promoting its well-being and happiness. We have to make greater efforts to avert the scourge of war and the complete destruction and annihilation it would cause. It is regrettable that the enormous financial resources are being used to achieve supremacy in the arms race rather than to free peoples from hunger  disease and backwardness through economic and social development.For these reasons  my country supports all sincere action aimed at diverting military expenditure to economic and social development in the developing countries and to the realization of all sound and legitimate aspirations.In this respect  and since the time is close at hand for the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean  I wish to reaffirm that my country rejects the idea of any military presence in the Indian Ocean and the Arab Sea. I wish to support the call to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace and security  free from foreign fleets and nuclear weapons. I also wish to support all efforts aimed at maintaining nuclear-weapon-free zones.We believe that the Middle Bast is one of the most sensitive areas which should be free of nuclear weapons  and that there should be international guarantees not to introduce such weapons into this area  their introduction would only increase existing tension in that area there end exacerbate the present situation which is the result of the policies and practices of Israel - aggressive policies  as you we know. For more than 30 years we have been repeating that the core of the Middle East conflict lies in the Palestinian cause.Today  we wish to reiterate before the whole world that international peace and security is constantly threatened by Israel as a result of its unchanging intransigence and its insistence on continuing to occupy Palestine  its denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  and its expansionist  aggressive and racist policies at the expense of the rights of the Palestinian people and the neighboring Arab countries. It also persists in all types of repression and oppression  which constitutes a challenge to the whole international community  and a stark violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations  and of its resolutions  as well as of all the international conventions and instruments on human rights and the freedom of peoples and nations.Our Arab nation has suffered a great deal from the implanting of the Zionist entity in the heart of the Arab nation  since the usurpation of Palestine  from the tine of the oppressive and aggressive wars against the Arab peoples up to the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The world has constantly condemned the aggressive policy of Israel; it has constantly denounced that policy  as is evidenced by the numerous resolutions adopted by this body  representing the will of the international community.Those resolutions attest to the continuous aggression of Israel  and the policy of occupation and annexation of territories by force which Israel has been pursuing. Those resolutions have called for its withdrawal from the territories of others that it has occupied  as well as for the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people. However  Israel  despite those resolutions  has been acting with arrogance and conceit  and flouting the will of the international community. It has rejected all these resolutions. This conduct could not have continued without the unlimited moral  economic and military support  given it by one of the super-Powers  the united States of America  which is supposed to fulfill a major role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The strategic alliance between Israel and the United States today is the clearest evidence of this unlimited support.It is high time for the international community to put an end to the arrogance and acts of aggression on the part of Israel  and to support the just rights of the Palestinian people  based on the justice of the Palestinian cause and the fact that it is the core of the Middle East conflict and that peace and security in the region will not be achieved except through a recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to return to its homeland  to determine its own future  and to establish an independent State on its national territory under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole legitimate representative.Hence  we reiterate the call to the countries that stand by Israel - first and foremost the United States of America  with its very special relations with Israel - to review their policy in the area  as well as their biased stand towards Israel  so that they can make a positive contribution to solving the Palestinian conflict and the problem of the Middle East  and so that they can co-operate with the international community in bringing pressure to bear on Israel to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations for the preservation of international peace and security.In this respect  the proposal to hold an international peace conference on the Middle East still represents  in our view  the only practical and sound framework for a solution of the Palestinian issue  because it is based on the participation of all the parties concerned  including the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  with a view to reaching a peaceful and just solution in the area.The Yemen Arab Republic  which has taken up a position of principle in supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  maintains that any settlement that ignores those rights is unjust and is foredoomed to failure. Unilateral solutions and settlements have not solved the Palestinian problem  but have made it more complex and diverted attention from the road to a sound and just solution. All the Arab countries have affirmed their sincere resolve concerning a just peace in the Middle East through the initiative based on resolutions of the 12th Arab Summit  which was welcomed and appreciated by many countries and organizations. It is an initiative which was reaffirmed by the resolution of the emergency Arab summit held in Casablanca last August.However  Israel  which is an entity primarily founded on aggression and terrorism  is not really desirous of a genuine and just peace. Each day brings more evidence that confirms this fact  which is a secret to no one.Just last week  military Israeli aircraft shelled civilian quarters in the sister state of Tunisia. Although this raid  as an act of aggression against the sovereignty of a Member State of this Organization  violated international law and tile Charter of the United Nations  Israel had no shame in admitting its responsibility for this barbarous air raid  which caused great loss of life and destruction.Since the United Nations is unable to punish Israel for its evil deeds  Israel will not give up its arrogance and its challenging attitude towards international public opinion  just like the racist regime in South Africa.The world is even more convinced today that the aggressive practices of Israel against the States of the region will not cease  remembering what took place in Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is still suffering under the yoke of occupation  on various pretexts that have no basis in international law or the United Nations Charter  which Israel is violating with such arrogance and unprecedented brazenness.In view of this continuing occupation of pacts of southern Lebanon  the United Nations must work for the immediate withdrawal of Israel  without any delay or conditions  in implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. At the same time we wish to affirm our unconditional support for the Lebanese people  which is steadfast in its legitimate struggle to liberate its territories  solve its problems without any outside interference or pressure  and exercise its sovereignty and freedom.Unfortunately  the Iraq-Iran war has entered its sixth year without a ray of hope for an end. There is even a threat of its being extended to neighboring areas  with such terrible consequences and implications for the region and international peace and security. The Yemen Arab Republic highly values Iraq's positive position and its sincere response to all efforts and good offices  especially those of the Secretary-General  as well as those of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It has accepted all the resolutions calling for a cessation of the war and sparing bloodshed  including Security Council resolution 540 (1983) and the resolutions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference issued after the Foreign Ministers' meeting in Sanaa last December.In view of the foregoing  we appeal to Iran to respond positively to those resolutions  initiatives and mediation efforts. We also call on all the countries of the world  especially the major Powers and those which can be influential  to assume their responsibilities for a cessation of this war and work towards reaching a just solution in keeping with the dignity and the legitimate rights of the two warring countries and in accordance with the rules of international law  peacefully and through negotiations.The continuation of the Afghan -problem  without a solution  represents in turn a continuous threat to stability in this crucial area. Therefore  we reiterate here once more the position of the Yemen Arab Republic that stands by all the efforts being made to solve this problem in a peaceful manner through negotiations between the parties concerned  in order that the Afghan people may be enabled to exercise its right to sovereignty and to choosing its own form and type of political  economic and social system  without any foreign pressure or interference.We believe that a start to solving the problem can be achieved in the return of the refugees to their homeland as soon as possible and by putting an end to all kinds of external intervention in Afghanistan  whatever the source.As for the question of Cyprus  the recent developments  including the problems confronted by the negotiators of the two communities  should not be the end of the road  because dialog  in our view  is the only way to reach an agreed upon solution guaranteeing for all freedom of religion and equality in rights and duties  in a unified and independent Cyprus.Although the world is today marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we are still confronting the chronic problem of the occupation of the Territory of Namibia by the racist Pretoria regime. Hence we must renew our efforts in supporting the struggle of the heroic Namibian people  under the leadership of the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. We call on the international community to solve the Namibian problem and break the vicious cycle by putting an end to the occupation of the Territory of Namibia by racist South Africa and strongly condemning the current measures of the South African regime  that are completely in contravention of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council.We believe that the implementation of the resolutions of this Organization  especially Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  constitutes the practical and suitable solution to this problem  which is one of the most invidious with regard to oppression  suppression and aggression.The international community has continuously condemned the racist policy of South Africa  which is a blot on the annals of modern history. It is regrettable that the racist Pretoria regime should still be unashamedly pursuing its racistpolicy  thus flouting all relevant international resolutions and international public opinion.Since birds of a feather flock together  this Fascist  racist regime has found no ally except Israel  with which it is linked in an unholy alliance; unfortunately  it is also supported by countries that pay unceasing lip-service to human rights and the defense of democratic freedoms. It is even more disturbing that such co-operation has not been confined to political co-ordination; it has been extended to something that is even more dangerous  the production of nuclear weapons.My delegation notes with satisfaction the aspirations expressed by the Korean people  in the North and the South  for reunification. We believe that the achievement of these goals can take place only through peaceful means and on a democratic basis  free from all foreign influences.My country  which is following with deep concern the disturbances and armed confrontations in Central America  is of the view that the best way to solve the problems and disputes lies in resort to dialog and other peaceful means  in addition to the need of providing the peoples of the States of the region an opportunity to decide on their own future and to choose their own forms of government without any foreign interference.The Yemen Arab Republic views with concern the continuation of instability in the world and the proliferation of tensions in international relations. Aware of its responsibilities and wishing to play a responsible role  both regionally and internationally  it decided to host the Fifteenth Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference last December in Sanaa. We were pleased that that important meeting was held on our territory  especially since its work was successful. The agenda contained a number of contemporary issues of interest to the Islamic nation which were considered in a spirit of responsibility and understanding.In keeping with my country's consistent position of principle  we have always adhered to the policy of non-alignment in all our practices and positions. We have always believed in promoting and supporting the activities of the Non-Aligned Movement  and in participating in forging its direction  as a safety valve for the developing and poor countries and as a shield against their being dragged into power rivalry. Non-alignment is the only way for third world countries to resist all forms of domination and hegemony on the part of the major Powers and support international peace and the promotion of detente and peaceful coexistence. Our concept of non-alignment is based on understanding and mutual  co-operation with other countries  whatever the political system and the philosophies and ideologies  within the framework of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs. This has been embodied in our foreign policy and has always been reflected in our international relations.The worsening world economic situation and other crises are due above all to the widening gap between the developed countries and the developing countries which has the effect of weakening the basis of relations between them. As long as the rich countries regard the developing countries as mere sources of their commodity requirements and markets for their processed products and not as partners  the relations between the two parties will not produce the desired results for the world economy because they are lacking in equity.There has been a proliferation of negative phenomena in the world economy  such as fluctuations of exchange rates and protectionist barriers that impede the progress of the developing countries. Action taken to restrict the transfer of technology to these countries has had the effect of aggravating economic crises. All this has negative and dangerous implications for the economies of the developing countries  which are experiencing a deterioration of the terms of their international trade and major deficits in their balance of trade  spiraling indebtedness  cutbacks in their development plans and a reduction of their economic growth. The continuation of this state of imbalance will lead to the collapse of their economies and make it impossible for them to meet their commitments  and will bring about the complete destruction of the world's monetary and commercial systems  which would be detrimental  to us all.For this reason  we call on the industrialized countries to show more understanding of the new international economic order  based on equity and justice  which would require the restructuring of economies and the establishment of a new international monetary system that would take into account all new circumstances and a balance between commerce and the prices of commodities. Indeed  the only way out of the deteriorating world economic situation is  to create new economic relations based on equity. We must therefore make a concerted effort to implement the resolutions of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly concerning global negotiations as the most effective solution. In that way we could support and activate international economic co-operation multilaterally and implement the principles of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of states  as well as the plans of action relating to the establishment of the new international economic order. The developing countries have put forward a number of practical solutions to deal with the economic crisis; these include the Caracas Program of Action and the initiatives of Buenos Aires  as well as the economic declarations of the seventh summit meeting of the non-aligned countries  what our world needs today is greater interdependence and complementarity; we can achieve more prosperity and happiness for mankind through an objective and comprehensive approach.My country  which is one of the least developed countries  has been afflicted in the past two years with earthquakes and repeated droughts  which led to changes in the programs that were to be implemented within the framework of the second five-year plan. However  we are still optimistic that  thanks to our rational leadership  with the help our brothers and friends  and through this Organization and other bodies  we shall be able to overcome the consequences of these unfavorable conditions.Despite the suffering endured by my country  it is following with extreme concern that of the African countries  especially Sudan  Somalia  Ethiopia  Chad and others  brought about by the drought that has led to the deaths of thousands by starvation. It calls on the international community  and especially the industrialized countries  to assume their historical responsibility to help these countries to overcome these catastrophes. We believe that economic development assistance will enable these countries to overcome their crises on the basis of the substantial new program of action adopted by the international community in favor of the least developed countries.As we celebrate at this session the fortieth anniversary of the founding of this Organization  we in the Yemen Arab Republic are aware more than ever before that we have achieved  through our participation in the work of the United Nations  something that is in keeping with the interests and links that bind us to the rest of the peoples and States of the world. The importance we attach to this Organization and its role is indicated by the fact that respect for the instruments of the United Nations and other international organizations was laid down as one of the six objectives of the revolution in our country  only a few days ago  on 26 September  my country celebrated the twenty-third anniversary of our glorious Septsrakar revolution. Its achievements indicate the devotion of our political leadership  under the presidency of Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh  to the aspirations of our people embodied in the six objectives of the glorious September revolution and its commitment to the approach clearly set forth in our Constitution. The progress made so proudly by our country along the path of economic development  especially in agricultural production  mining and oil prospecting  is regarded by our political leadership as a necessary step in consolidating the freedom of the individual  since man is both the means and the end of development.The latest elections held to enlarge the membership of the General People's Congress and civic Councils have reaffirmed  through the approach adopted and the purpose envisaged  the principle of popular participation in assuming responsibility for the course of development. At the same time they reflect the resolve of our political leadership to pursue the democratic option which ensures individual and collective freedoms in an equal manner; It is gratifying that our people in the south and in the north have made great progress towardsreunification  thanks to the success of the methods adopted by the political leadership in the two parts of Yemen in creating the basis for common institutions. Those two leaderships  through the higher Yemen Council  have decided to implement the recommendations of the unity committees in all fields -and that augurs well for unification.The United Nations  which is now 40 years old  is called upon more than ever before to continue to promote the confidence of peoples in the organization. The best way of doing so would be to solve  at this historic session  some of the chronic problems it faces  as the Secretary-General has suggested in his annual report. Despite the number and complexity of those problems  certain issues  such as those relating to Palestine  the Middle East  Namibia and South Africa  should be given priority.Those issues have remained unsolved for many years  even decades. If that were achieved we would make this session a historic one indeed.Needless to say  the United Nations success in fulfilling its assigned role and implementing the aims of the Charter depends basically on the extent of the co-operation of the Member countries and their adherence to its resolutions -something for which all countries must strive to ensure the well-being  peace and tranquility of mankind.A world without the United Nations would be more prone to anarchy - and perhaps even to all-out war. In spite of our Organization's shortcomings  it still remains the best framework for dialog to settle disputes among warring factions and reconcile different creeds and various interests - the best tool for resolving conflicts and disputes. Despite the criticisms directed against it  since its inception the United Nations has been able to play a tangible role in the maintenance of international peace and security  to contribute to the solution of many problems and crises in various parts of the world  and to lend its support in the struggle of many peoples that have now gained their independence and become Members of the Organization  thanks to the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted in 1960  the twenty-fifth anniversary of which  among others  .the United Nations is commemorating this year.In conclusion  I am honored to convey to the Assembly greetings and best wishes from my country  its leadership  Government and people. I wish success for this historic session so that understanding  love  justice and peace may prevail in our world."
"135",7548,"YUG",40,1985,"At this moment of great tragedy which has befallen the people of friendly Mexico I cannot but  first and foremost  express the deepest condolences and solidarity of the people of Yugoslavia. We are convinced that the international community will do its best and provide necessary relief to the people and Government of Mexico in their self-sacrificing efforts to overcome the effects of this dreadful catastrophe.Mr. President  it gives me pleasure to congratulate you  the representative of Spain  a country with which Yugoslavia has good and friendly relations  on your election to the high office of President of the fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly of the united Nations.I also wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continued efforts to make the United Nations a forum for an equitable dialog on all issues of vital interest for the international community.We come to the fortieth session of the General Assembly feeling that it is necessary to recall  for the sake of the future  the path that our Organization took to reach this anniversary. Moreover  we come with a feeling of responsibility to make a common decision  at this historic turning point  as to what should be done with a view to building a better and more just world.The United Nations was conceived as an expression of the desire and effort of peace-loving peoples of the world to embark  after a war that had caused unparalleled destruction and loss of human lives  upon a road of peace  co-operation on equal footing  a road that would ensure the fulfillment of the essential aspirations of countries and peoples for freedom  independence and progress. The principles and objectives laid down in the Charter  which we have made universal  have been our lodestar and support in securing the basic inalienable rights of all countries and peoples irrespective of race  level of development and political system. Experience has shown that there can be no true peace or progress in the world unless these rights are fully exercised.During the 40 years of the existence of the United Nations  the world underwent vast changes. The United Nations was an integral part of these changes  affecting them and changing itself in the process. During these decades our Organization gave a great contribution to the preservation of peace and security in the world. Under the auspices and with the assistance of the United Nations  the struggle for the liberation of peoples from colonial rule and domination was won. Newly liberated and sovereign States  with equal rights entered the world scene  thus radically changing the map of the world. Often  when we sought ways of meeting the great challenges that we had to face  this universal forum witnessed patience  wisdom and faith in progress. This is where a new international practice and awareness were forged  notwithstanding all the difficulties and resistance encountered. This is where we elaborated  codified and tried to make universal the rules governing relations among sovereign nations and States. This is where we adopted the concept of the new international economic order. This is where we defined the ideals of peace and progress for all  in keeping with the new  historic era  thus narrowing the scope for the use of force and for the pursuit of the policy of domination.In this period mankind advanced greatly in all fields. The technological revolution has given rise to possibilities undreamed of before.The struggle for freedom and independence  equitable international relations  a world free of blocs and development led .to the inception of the policy of non-alignment. This policy was essential in that struggle and with its principles  objectives and thrust it has become an irreplaceable  independent factor of positive influence in global international relations.However  these long decades have brought us many disappointments and much distress. Quite a few of our aspirations of 40 years ago are still unfulfilled. The purposes and principles of the Charter pertaining to the preservation of international peace and security  respect for the tenets of self-determination and the sovereign equality of all countries  refraining from the threat or use of force  the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as many others  have been in constant and serious jeopardy. The achievements of mankind are far from being accessible to all. Many people the world over are deprived of basic opportunities for development and of means for a bare existence.Therefore it is justifiable to ask what is the nature of the peace in which we live and how far we are from lasting and universal peace. Unfortunately  the peace of today is neither lasting nor universal. He have been living in a state of permanent uncertainty  faced with confrontations  local wars and conflicts  bloc rivalries and the arms race. Four decades after the most horrible of all wars we wonder whether the danger of a new one has been removed and  if so  to what extent. We are not sure that a new war  far more terrifying and totally devastating  will not break out.For a long time now the world has been at a historic crossroads. Which way and how should we proceed in order to ensure lasting peace? Which way and how should we proceed in order to overcome all the factors that make this peace so fragile and uncertain? Which way and how should we proceed in order to eliminate injustices and inequalities  so as to achieve development and progress for all in a world in which peace would be enjoyed by all?Awareness of the need to carry out radical changes in all spheres of international relations has grown in the world  as have the forces striving to that end. These changes would lead us out of this time of grave challenges towards the goals we defined and set for ourselves in this very forum. In the world of today of great achievements of the human mind  no one should be a passive onlooker while wars are being waged for the sake of others and people are dying of hunger or living without hope. We can neither condone nor accept the idea that peace and prosperity for anyone can be built on such foundations. We can neither condone nor accept the idea that peace and progress can be ensured by the stockpiling of ever more destructive weapons. The arms race imperils the security of all  while inequality in economic and other relations threatens the stability and prosperity even of those who perpetuate such a situation through their monopolistic and privileged positions.The forthcoming negotiations between the great Powers and their approaching summit meeting are awaited with great attention and interest by us all. At their recent conference in Luanda  the non-aligned countries welcomed that development in the relations between the great Powers  calling upon them""to eschew mutual confrontation  overcome mistrust and embark upon responsible and fruitful negotiations  with a forward-looking approach and in a spirit of goodwill  bearing in mind the interest of all mankind"".We expect that their dialog will lead to the easing of tension in their relations and in the world at large  since confrontation and the strained relations between them and between the blocs have afflicted us all. Like all other non-aligned countries  we believe that  in order to be fruitful and universally beneficial  this dialog should be carried on in keeping with the objectives of the United Nations and with the establishment of a true system of collective security.At the same time I wish to emphasize our profound conviction that all should be involved in the quest for solutions to the crucial issues of the world. Our experience to date has shown that the only possible way of ensuring true detente is to involve all countries and peoples and consider their vital interests. Today it is not in the interest of a single country or group of countries to remain on the sidelines of world developments  without any influence over them  because the<t own independence and prosperity depend thereon. The horizon of international relations can be cleared of all clouds only if all countries are active in the implementation of the principles of peaceful co-existence and the broadest possible co-operation. Every contribution to that end is truly invaluable.My country has always attached the utmost importance to disarmament issues  being deeply convinced that security and stable relations throughout the world cannot be built under the shadow.of stirs. Disarmament has today become the pivotal issue for the survival of mankind. Military expenditures  which have reached exorbitant figures this year  have hindered development and the progress of nations. Although the announcement of negotiations between the great Powers brings much relief and rays of hope  the continuance of the arms race and the attempts to extend it into outer space give rise to new fears. In the present international situation the beginning of the process of disarmament  both nuclear and conventional  is of paramount importance. As regards disarmament  the direction is clear and the measures that should be taken urgently to halt the arms race are well known. This path should be embarked upon and these measures should be carried out. Our demands and expectations go beyond starting the process of halting the arms race. Our expectations are the creation of an atmosphere conducive to a relaxation of international tension which will lead to the solution of all problems jeopardizing peace and security.In southern Africa  the blood of innocent people is being shed only because they seek the elementary human right to freedom and independence and to liberation from domination and racial oppression. In South Africa  at this precise time  hundreds and hundreds of people are being killed only because they wish to have equal rights. There should be no further hesitation regarding the application of sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter against the Pretoria regime  By holding its ministerial conference in Luanda and by deciding to hold the eighth summit of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in a front-line State  freedom-loving Zimbabwe  the world of the non-aligned expressed its full solidarity with and support for the struggle of the people of South Africa and the struggle for the final liberation and independence of Namibia under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative  the South west Africa People's organization (SWAPO). We most strongly condemn the constant pressure and flagrant aggression by South Africa against non-aligned Angola.Concerted efforts are indispensable to bring the war between Iran and Iraq to an end. There is no justification whatsoever for its continuance.The full exercise of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish their own State under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their legitimate representative  can no longer be delayed; nor can the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied Arab territories.He are deeply concerned and troubled by the escalation of armed intervention and pressure against the sovereignty and independence of Nicaragua.The peoples of Kampuchea  Afghanistan and Grenada must be given the opportunity to decide their destiny themselves  free from the presence of foreign troops. He support all efforts to preserve the integrity and independence of Cyprus. We also support the efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to fulfill the aspiration to unification of the Korean people.International economic relations form one of the main fronts in the struggle for the stable development of the world as a whole and for the further democratization of international relations. There can be no safe development and sure survival for anyone in conditions of an enormous gap in the level of development and affluence such as exists today and is constantly widening.The developing world is faced with basic problems of existence. The development of entire continents is stagnating. If the present rate of growth were to remain unchanged  developing countries would need almost an entire century to reach the current level of the developed part of the world* Yet in the year 2000 they will account for 80 per cent of the world's population.This situation has been dramatically aggravated by the enormous debt burden on the shoulders of the developing countries. The non-aligned countries devoted a great deal of attention to this matter at their conference in Luanda. They invited international financial and banking institutions as well as the Governments of creditor countries to take part in a constructive political dialog in order to find a just and lasting solution to this problem. They also proposed several concrete and realistic measures which could serve as a basis for reaching agreement on this problem  which has spread far beyond regional boundaries and become a global political problem.Together with all non-aligned and developing countries  we call for an urgent guest for solutions through a dialog with developed countries with regard not only to debts but to other issues upon which the development and future of all depend. This is in the interest of both developed and developing countries and creditors and debtors alike. Any delay could cause a chain reaction of upheaval and disruption  with far-reaching consequences. Yugoslavia calls for the united Nations to take an active role in resolving the debt problem  which does not preclude the participation of other international bodies. We believe that everything possible should be done at this session of the General Assembly to ensure the convening at an early date of an international conference on money and financing for development. We fully support the request of the Organization of African unity regarding the convening of a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa.I should also like to point out the importance that we attach to the adoption at this session of the declaration on the right to development. We consider this to be an integral part of the efforts aimed at promoting human rights and freedoms.Yugoslavia  as one of the founders of the United Nations  has contributed through its commitment and activity in this forum over the past four decades to the search for solutions to all the problems that weigh upon the world today. I should like to recall the deep faith that President Tito always had in the United Nations and its mission of democratization of international relations. We are determined to proceed along that path together with all others who share the same aspirations.In spite of many challenges  the lasting value of the united Nations Charter has been confirmed during the past 40 years. Today more than ever before the world needs reaffirmation of the role of the United Nations. Yugoslavia deeply believes that the United Nations is an irreplaceable factor in bringing all countries together on an equal footing in endeavors aimed at resolving the vital problems of the world. It is precisely for that reason that the United Nations will be equally necessary to the world in the decades to come.If the gap in development continues to grow and if the arms race is not halted  it is an open question whether and how we shall observe future anniversaries and what the world will then be like. We must find a way to ensure development for all. There can be no peace without development  nor development without peace. Peace and detente should therefore be imbued with new substance and given a fresh impetus. Only in a world at peace can spiritual and material well-being be enhanced  differences eliminated and the qualities of peoples and countries and human dignity promoted.Let us do our best to make the fifth decade of the United Nations a decade wide open to co-operation  understanding and the resolution of problems by concerted effort  in the common interest of all countries. This we can do by strengthening the role of the United Nations and providing for far greater efficiency in its activities. We are convinced that the forthcoming gathering of Heads of State or Government in this same forum will give a strong creative impetus to such efforts and such development."
"136",7646,"ZWE",40,1985,"Mr. President  I wish to extend to you. Sir  my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the historic fortieth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your now legendary wide diplomatic experience and wisdom will guide this important fortieth session of the General Assembly to a fruitful conclusion of its work. I should like to assure you  Sir  of my delegation's co-operation in your effort to carry out your arduous duties and to fulfill your heavy responsibilities.At the same time we would like to express our appreciation to the President of the thirty-ninth session of this Assembly  our brother Ambassador Paul Lusaka of Zambia  for the efficient and businesslike manner in which he conducted the affairs of the last session.Finally  I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in search of peace and for the excellent practical interpretation of the meaning of the United Nations which he demonstrated in the past year to millions of the hungry and homeless of the world. Such a successful concrete manifestation of guided collective efforts in solving international humanitarian problems as we witnessed in the past year augurs well for the future and is ample justification for the continued existence of this Organization.Allow me at this juncture to express the profound grief of the people and Government of Zimbabwe over the tragedy that befell the brother people of Mexico during the past month  we offer our most heartfelt condolences and convey our feelings of solidarity to the people and Government of Mexico during these sad times.This year's report of the Secretary-General (A/40/1)  like those of previous years  provides us with ideas and facts  both disturbing and encouraging; pinpoints and analyses the flaws and strengths of our Organization from its corporate body to its separate organs; warns against deviations from the original purposes and principles of our organization  in particular against the drift towards unilateralism  isolationism and protectionism to the exclusion and at the expense of collectivism  internationalism and multilateralism; and advises on some courses of action to repair damages to and restore confidence and hope in the Organizations' capabilities and potentialities. It is our fervent hope that this report and the declaration to be adopted during this fortieth anniversary celebration will be seriously studied and a mechanism will be set up to explore modalities for implementing some of the suggestions that could strengthen our Organization.At the end of the Second World War 40 years ago  the world was faced with cities in ruins and economies in shambles  millions of refugees and displaced people  millions of orphans and disabled men and women  and with millions of people under colonial domination and oppression. Out of these ashes of despair  the United Nations was born as a symbol of faith and hope in a future where all nations  large and small  would be free to take collective responsibility for the maintenance of peace; a future in which free nations would ""... develop friendly relations ... based an respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ..."" and a future where there would be ""... international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character ..."".I advisedly recall the above purposes of this Organization. Similarly I advisedly recall the following principles of this Organization: the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members; the principle that all Members should fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter; the principle that States  in settling their international disputes  shall not endanger international peace and security and justice; and the principle that States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.These were considered the sine qua non basic purposes and principles necessary for the creation and maintenance of peace and for conducting civilized  legal international relations. Forty years after the war  the relatively long and unprecedented period of peace  during and because of which the world has witnessed a significant economic recovery and expansion  great scientific and political developments  and an increase in the awareness and enjoyment of human rights  the world is facing yet another danger  the danger resulting from man's cynicism about the capability of the United Nations to live up to the expectations that are set out in the purposes and principles of the Charter. The cynics point to the conflicts in Korea  Viet Nam  and more recently  in Central America and the Middle East  to the Iran-Iraq war  to the conflicts in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  and to the problems of Namibia  South Africa's abhorrent apartheid system  and so forth.The list of failures includes the continuing arms race and spread of nuclear weapons development capability outside the so-called nuclear club  the withdrawal and threats of withdrawal from some international organizations like the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Labor Organization (ILO)  non-accession to or non-ratification by some States of a majority of the human rights Conventions; countless violations of the united Nations Charter and decisions; the repeated use of the veto deliberately to frustrate the majority in the Security Council itself or recommendations from the overwhelming majority in the General Assembly - a travesty of the democratic process which we all cherish - and the contempt with which some States defiantly refuse to answer charges brought against them in the International Court of Justice.Despite the obvious failures and weaknesses of the United Nations because of the lack of a political will on the part of some States that are reluctant to offer more support for the Organization  the United Nations system has more than demonstrated its validity  practicality  potentiality and indeed its necessity.When the United Nations fails  it is in fact the Member States collectively that have failed and when the United Nations succeeds  it is the collective success of Member States. The United Nations is a vehicle or facilitator at the disposal of Member States. Its ability successfully to carry us all to our destination depends on our collective efforts concertedly and vigorously to push the correct buttons on the machine.The United Nations has developed into a reliable center for harmonizing actions of nations in the attainment of the common objectives. We should all unite  and reaffirm our determination to improve the Organization for a better world  avoiding the dangerous retreat into the chaotic chauvinistic cocoon of isolationism. We believe in the ability of the multilateral system to resolveinternational problems  but for this to become reality we must fulfill our obligations to the Charter and act in accordance with its principles.One of the major objectives of the United Nations whose theme runs like a binding thread through the Charter is ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  and to that end the Member States are called upon to unite by taking collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Forty years after the founding of this Organization  the Member States have still not succeeded in removing the biggest threat to peace - the bomb hanging over our heads. For whereas 40 years ago one country possessed the bomb  today there are five and probably nine countries with the resources and technical know-how to develop nuclear weapons  and the number is increasing. The total destructive capacity of bombs in the possession of the two super-Powers only - the United States and the Soviet Union - is enough to kill and wipe out everyone and every living organism  not once but many times over. Yet the stockpiling  the perfecting and deploying of these weapons of mass incineration is continuing  with some plans to base some of them in space. What space is there left for peaceful purposes? The chances of a nuclear holocaust increase with the inevitable proliferation of nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is inevitable  because those possessing them have failed to abide by the terms and expectations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. As the Secretary-General stated in his message to the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons:""the Treaty is not a one-way street. In signing it  the nuclear-weapon States parties agreed to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament. In this respect  the implementation of the Treaty has been largely one-sided  to the understandable concern and profound dissatisfaction of its non-nuclear-weapon parties. There must be recognition of the fact that restraint on one side cannot reasonably be demanded in the face of unlimited expansion on the other.""This clear warning must be heeded. Peace is in the interest of all of us and we all need it. Let us all  as a first step  be involved in the reduction of the military budget - which is now  we understand  $900 000 billion - and use the savings to feed the hungry  shelter the homeless  cure the sick  and educate the ignorant and illiterate. Nuclear-weapon States must live up to the letter and spirit of the 1963 Non-Proliferation Treaty and begin arms reduction talks leading to the signing of a total nuclear disarmament treaty. The same nuclear-weapon-State parties must demonstrate their commitment by engaging in sincere and ongoing pursuit of the nuclear-arms control negotiations. We call on Member States to put an end to nuclear-weapon testing. We commend those States that have heeded the voices of their people and resisted the pressure to have nuclear missiles stationed on their territories or to have nuclear-weapon-carrying ships call at their harbours. Such principled actions will go a long way towards the removal of threats to peace. We call on the Soviet Union and the United States seriously to engage in negotiations to end the mad race for armament. We hope that at the forthcoming super-Power summit  both President Reagan andGeneral Secretary Gorbachev will avoid point-scoring and posturing and remember the heavy responsibility they carry on behalf of the whole of humanity; for never before in the history of man have the hopes and future of so many depended on the wisdom and good sense of so few  as is the case in the nuclear age.One of the greatest challenges facing the world today is the task o£ achieving international co-operation to manage and sustain economic recovery from the recession of the early 1980s  a recession to be remembered as the worst ever during the post-war era. Many countries have gone or are going through a period of severe crisis and in Africa  a combination of the crisis and adverse climatic and man-made factors have generated catastrophic conditions with horrific consequences.Opinions have been expressed during the course of this debate that the recession is now behind us and that the worst is over. But we all know that the worst is indeed not over as yet. We all know that we are still suffering; we all know there are some countries which are still in the grip of this terrible situation.The combined effects of many of those policies  and indeed the combined effects of these problems  has brought about a situation which is in fact bringing many countries to near collapse.Although this observation is supported by empirical evidence  it is alarming to concede that at present there are no negotiated policy instruments to counteract the emerging negative trends. Instead of active policy intervention we seem to have resigned our fate to certain magical forces that would diffuse economic recovery through some random process of osmosis.The imperative before us is not to dream but to develop a coherent set of co-ordinated policies to counteract these trends. The first order of business would be to seek ways and means of injecting fresh liquidity in the world economy through the enlargement of the capital base of the World Bank  the easing of International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions  debt cancellations  multi-year debt re-scheduling and a special issue of the special drawing rights (SDRs).A necessary condition for the rehabilitation of productive capacity is the restoration of a dynamic  open and non-discriminatory international trading system. Hence if free trade is to resume its role as an engine of growth  it is important that we halt the state of decay that has beset the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) system. In this regard  we call upon the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries to honor the standstill and rollover commitments that were negotiated in UNCTAD IV and in the GATT Ministerial meeting of 1982.If trade is to be beneficial to all countries  developing countries should be guaranteed just and equitable prices for their exports. Indeed  no durable economic recovery can take place unless urgent steps are taken to safeguard the incomes of primary commodity producers. The Integrated Program of Commodities has already demonstrated its potential for protecting the incomes of primary goods exporters  and it would be to be benefit of all if more and elaborate commodity agreements were concluded. The activation of the Common Fund for Commodities and the strengthening of both the stabex scheme and IMF compensatory facility for export earnings shortfalls would contribute significantly to the recovery of incomes in developing countries.Durable economic recovery would be stabilized only by policies that would generate a sustained transfer of financial resources to developing countries. This conclusion is not rhetorical but is prompted by the consideration that at present developing countries are engaged in a costly adjustment process that requires massive capital inputs. In such circumstances the present trend of reverse capital flows to developed countries is not acceptable and should be stopped. Developing countries are now paying $72 billion annually in interest payments and in the coming five years about two-thirds of the third-world debt will have to be repaid or rolled over. As for Africa  the projections are that capital outflows will exceed combined official development assistance inflows.It is unrealistic to expect that developing countries would in the medium- and long-term  generate trade surpluses sufficient to finance their currently structured debt obligations. It is equally scandalous to expect Africa  a continent that is fighting for its survival to shoulder a debt burden of 59 per cent of its export earnings. Essentially  our argument is that the recession of the early 1980s halted the capital formation process in the developing countries and an injection of new capital is a condition for the reactivation of the development process. As it is  high interest rates and the scarcity of new loans are forcing countries to make repayments at the expense of essential imports. It is unrealistic to expect that trade surpluses would diffuse the debt bomb particularly in a trade context characterized by rising protectionism  declining commodity prices and monetary instabilities.An examination of the interrelationships among the issues of debt  trade  money and finance convinces us that the existing narrow approaches to the debt crisis are inadequate. The responsibility for resolving this crisis must be shared equitably between the debtor and the creditor countries. Such an approach suggests a condition for resolving the debt crisis  the condition being that the debtor country should remain solvent and viable in order for that party to discharge its contractual obligations  thus satisfying that conditions can safeguard the international credit system as we know it today. If it is a shared objective that the present credit system has to be preserved  which implies the solvency of the debtor country  then we need a forum where debt policies consistent with those shared objectives could be negotiated. At present such a forum does not exist.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has called for an international conference on debt. It is important that the present session of the General Assembly make advances towards that objective. We have already stated that it is not serious to expect Africa over the medium term to sustain the present hemorrhage of capital caused by debt servicing. The twenty-first session of the Organization of African Unity summit on economic matters has called for an international conference on African debt. This proposal should be viewed as part and parcel of the present initiatives for halting the economic crisis in Africa.The African economic crisis is one of development  and unless the structural constraints are addressed it is likely to become a permanent feature. The OAU leaders have assumed responsibility for pulling Africa out of this tragedy. But to do this effectively they still need more support as well as the creation of external economic conditions conducive to the resumption of growth and economicactivity. Since there is a perceptible international consensus to resolve the African issue  as evidenced by the consensus declaration on the African economic crisis adopted by the General Assembly  it is time that this good will was translated into concrete action. The OAU Summit has already initiated consultations on the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to Africa. We call upon the international community in a spirit of solidarity to lend its support to this legitimate African request. Today the spirit of multilateralism is at its lowest ebb  meaningful dialog no longer exists and confidence and support for multilateral institutions have been replaced by confrontation and bilateralism. This development stands in antithesis to the dreams of yesterday. Worse still  over the past 40 years we have forged a truly interdependent world and the present policies of some industrialized countries seem to be alien to our economic reality - perhaps they belong to a future era  a future of anarchy.Our plea is for moderation  dialog  negotiations and compromises. The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations gives us an occasion to commit ourselves and our collective resources to the challenge of eradicating poverty  illiteracy  hunger  malnutrition and disease throughout the world.There is no alternative to multilateralism. It is a fact of life dictated by the reality of inter-independence  a reality that can only be ignored at our own peril. A consensus for development is pXso a consensus for resuming dialog on the institutional obstacles to the launching of the global negotiations on the establishment of a new economic order. Indeed  the people of the world and their governments have the potential of rising to sued) a challenge  and this solemn occasion should generate the necessary political will that would sustain that renewed commitment to development.Unity of purpose is particularly vital when dealing with hotbeds of tension and conflict in the present world. Regional conflicts  if incorrectly handled  have the capacity to engulf us all in a major catastrophe. And of the many regions of tension and conflict today  few challenge the United Nations system with such poignancy as the tragic situation prevailing in southern Africa. In that corner of the world many fundamental principles forming the bedrock of this Organization and the brotherhood of man are under severe threat from the arrogance and greed of a small group of frightened and narrow-minded men. The hallowed principles of ""equal rights and self-determination of peoples""  and the cardinal principles that ""States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State"" are all violated by the apartheid regime of South Africa. Aggression  intervention  interference  discrimination  destabilization  colonialism and racism are the hallmarks of the Pretoria regime. The Pretoria regime's continued existence poses a threat to international peace and security. Apartheid is in every sense and meaning a crime against humanity and a threat to international peace and security of the same genre and origin as nazism  its spiritual and philosophic ancestor.The inability  nay the unwillingness  of those great Powers that wield such obvious influence over South Africa  to flex their muscles in order to force Pretoria to change its inhuman policies  is one of the greatest betrayals of the United Nations system and the concept of the brotherhood of man. We have all recently witnessed just how vulnerable South Africa is to economic pressure from the Western countries. This vulnerability was recently demonstrated by the nervousness that led to a heavy depreciation of South African financial assets in international markets. Yes  South Africa was nearly brought to its knees by nervousness alone. I therefore would ask this august body to reflect on what concerted international political action could achieve in South Africa if the mere nervousness of markets produced such a panic.It is the appearance or the reality of the indifference and cynicism of these great nations that emboldens the racist regime. Time and again we have seen the United Nations frustrated by the abuse of the veto power by the United States and the United Kingdom in defense of South Africa. I appeal to the leaders of these two great nations to live up to some of the noble traditions of their countries by accepting their responsibility in the fight for justice and human dignity in South Africa and Namibia and to stop being the misguided protectors of this evil regime.I speak these words  not in anger  for we already have too many angry young men and women in southern Africa today; it is more with sadness and sorrow that I mention the tragedy in South Africa. Despite the recent semantics of reform  the sad reality is that the regime remains obdurate. Racism is the order of the day.the majority are still denied participation in the process of government  and the carnage and slaughter continues unabated. What we have seen is the gimmickry of the creation of the tripartite parliaments  a mere elaboration of the doctrine of separation; the setting up of innumerable commissions whose findings are known even before those commissions are set up.It has all been talk  talk  talk  without any concrete positive action. What is really needed is a dismantlement of apartheid. The only action we have witnessed is the old brutal repression at home and naked aggression broad. Nearly a thousand people have been killed in the streets of South Africa in the last 12 months  and the carnage continues. There is the incarceration of thousands of schoolchildren  women and workers for daring to demand justice and equality  and the suppression of peaceful demonstrations with bullets  truncheons and the hippo-hide whips called sjamboks. The picture has been depressingly familiar.Not content with inflicting such misery  destruction and bloodshed on its own citizenry  the racist regime has continued to export violence to neighbours. The recent barbaric and unprovoked acts of aggression unleashed against the innocent people of Angola is one in a litany of dastardly deeds that Pretoria has perpetrated against Angola. It should be recalled that earlier this year one of its commando units was caught red-handed trying to blow up the Cabinda oil installations in Angola in the hope of crippling the economy of that country.After that disastrous mission  the racists then tried to recoup their bruised pride by sending a murder squad into Gaborone  the capital of Botswana. That gang of cutthroats murdered  in cold blood  12 refugees and Botswana nationals  including a six-year-old boy  all in their sleep. The action of the regimeagainst the small kingdom of Lesotho  against Zambia  Mozambique and my own country  Zimbabwe  are a matter of public record. In the case of Zimbabwe the racists have a dual strategy. The first is to recruit  train  finance  equip and deploy dissidents and malcontents  whom they infiltrate back into Zimbabwe to spread destruction and fear. A social radio station has been installed in Northern Transvaal  for use by these bandits  which daily broadcasts hostile propaganda against my Government. She second is to use the bandits in Mozambique  known as Mozambique Nationals Resistance Movement  to cut all of Zimbabwe's outlets to the sea through Mozambique  whether by raiT. road or pipeline. South Africa's continued use of rebels in Mozambique is a flagrant violation of the solemn and binding undertaking it entered into at the time of the signing of the Nkomati agreement.Besides trying to overthrow the Government of Mozambique  the second aim of these bandits as directed by Pretoria is to make Zimbabwe and other landlocked southern African States become totally dependent on South Africa. In this way  it is hoped  we would become hostages in any moves to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa. The argument can then be made that the black people of South Africa and the majority-ruled independent States surrounding South Africa would be the first to suffer if sanctions were imposed against South Africa.We do not want the international community to shirk its responsibility to the people of South Africa by hiding behind our vulnerability to South Africa's reprisals if mandatory sanctions are imposed against it. We accept that there is a price to be paid for the liberty of our brothers and sisters in South Africa and Namibia. For our part  we are prepared to play our full role; but equally we expect the international community to shoulder its responsibility to the region for the consequences of any decision and action it may take  including mandatory sanctions  in fulfillment of its duties and obligations to the people of South Africa.The now over-delayed independence of the illegally occupied Territory of Namibia represents one of the most glaring failures of the United Nations since its inception. The legality of the issue is not in doubt  and an internationally negotiated and agreed plan to bring the Territory to independence has long been in place - ever since the adoption of resolutions 435 (1978). Yet extraneous issues of East-West rivalry  expediency and cynicism have been allowed to cloud and derail the process of bringing Namibia to independence. It is such callous calculations and selfishness on the part of the big Powers that cause frustration  despair and anger among the weaker nations.Before the advent of the concept of what has now been renamed the policy of ""active constructive engagement"" - presumably as distinct from the previous and now discredited policy of ""passive constructive engagement"" - and its concepts of linkage and parallelism  the Pretoria regime had agreed to the implementation of resolution 435 (1978); but since then linkage has introduced an ideological content into Pretoria's resistance to granting Namibia its independence. Linkage has thereby given respectability to the racist intention. Therefore it is heavily responsible for delaying Namibia's independence. For this reason the Government of the United States bears a special responsibility in the delaying of Namibia's independence.The presence of Cuban troops in Angola is a matter between the sovereign States of Cuba and Angola. It has nothing to do with independence for the struggling masses of Namibia. The struggling Namibians have no control over this matter  just as they have no control over the issue of foreign forces in Guantanamo and Diego Garcia and the hundreds of thousands of foreign troops  missiles and other military equipment stationed in other countries all over the world. They should not be penalized for matters which are totally irrelevant to their demand for freedom. It is not fair or just to use their independence as a pawn and to hold them as hostages for whom a ransom has to be paid. We condemn this cynicism and this unprincipled behavior perpetrated by Members of this Organization.The Middle East continues to cause great concern to all of us. Peace in that region remains elusive and will continue to be so as long as Israel is permitted to defy United Nations resolutions calling for its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories  including the Golan Heights. We condemn in the strongest terms possible the recent gross Israeli violation of Tunisia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the cold-blooded murder and maiming of defenseless Palestinian refugees. We warn that Israel's bellicose behavior and hegemonistic tendencies pose a serious threat to the stability of the region as well as tointernational peace and security. We call upon Israel to end its expansionist policies and to start negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization  the legitimate and sole representative of the Palestinians. Israel is in the Middle East  and if peace is to come to that part of the world all the people of that area  including the Israelis  must observe  in good faith  the principles of good-neighborliness. We are aware that Israel has now acquired nuclear-weapon technology and that it may already have the deadly weapon. We are also informed that some such weapons may have been deployed in the Golan Heights. This brings a new and more dangerous dimension to the area  as it may not be long before other States in the region also acquire the same capability  and world peace will then be faced with a very grave threat. This body cannot wait until such a crisis arises. Therefore we strongly support the call for an urgent international conference on the Middle East at which all concerned and involved in the dispute would participate. We believe that such a conference without the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization would be like trying to stage Shakespeare's Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.My Government is seriously concerned at the continuing war between the two sister countries  Iran and Iraq. We urge them to resolve their dispute peacefully and to concentrate on rebuilding their war-ravaged economies.We are appalled at the repeated interference in the domestic affairs of other states by some States Members of this Organization. In the case of Nicaragua  we have witnessed the open threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of that country. There is a military and economic siege of that country  all because it has decided to be free to choose a socio-economic political system most suited to its own peculiar situation. The United States Administration finances  trains  equips and deploys the contras in Nicaragua  where they are committing msrJar   rape and economic sabotage and making the lives of the people of that country a real nightmare. We condemn in no uncertain terms such barbaric actions perpetrated against a small nation that cam in no way pose any threat to the security and interests of the mighty United States. We call on the United States to observe the rule of international law in its relationship with Nicaragua and leave that country to pursue its awn course.We call on all interested parties to participate in and fully support the efforts of the Contadora group. We are confident that the interests and concerns of the Central American States would be served in the context of a comprehensive agreement reached within and by that group. We salute the efforts of the Contadora a group of nations and urge them to persevere in their noble goal.We reiterate our opposition to the invasion of  interference with or intervention in the internal affairs of one country by another  be it in Grenada  El Salvador  Lebanon  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Mayotte  East Timor  Chad or Western Sahara. We call on the interventionist States to withdraw their troops and let the peoples of those countries run their affairs free from any interference. We commend the Secretary-General for his efforts in seeking solutions to some of these problems and urge him to persevere until just and honorable solutions are found.The situation in Cyprus continues to threaten peace in that country and in the Mediterranean region as a whole. We demand the Secretary-General and his envoy for their efforts in bringing the two Cypriot communities together to discuss their common destiny. We call upon all outside Powers to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Cyprus and to remove their troops from that island State.There will be no peace or security on the Korean peninsula as long as foreign troops and missiles remain stationed in South Korea and Korea remains divided Foreign interference must stop  to facilitate and encourage South and North Korea to engage in meaningful discussions aimed at the peaceful reunification of that country. The reduction of tension and potential conflict is in the interest of us all. We therefore call for the start of negotiations involving all the parties concerned  including the United States.I want to leave this body with one message  and it is this. As we spin into the unknown void behind the galaxies  let no one ever forget that we are on this spaceship  planet Earth  together. Let us therefore pool our resources  our enormous scientific and technical know-how and our collective wisdom and will to make this  our Earth  a home worthy of man  a shining star among the stars of the universe."
