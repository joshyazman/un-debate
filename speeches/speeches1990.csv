"1",20,"AFG",45,1990,"﻿Allow me  first of all  Sir  to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the high post of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I wish you every success in the fulfilment of the great tasks before you. Your experience  wisdom and skills make us confident of the fruitful outcome of the work of the current international gathering. I wish also to express my gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria  for his outstanding contribution to the work of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.May I also take this opportunity to extend to the delegation of Liechtenstein my warm congratulations on its joining the United Nations as the newest Member of the Organisation. Liechtenstein’s application and admission are yet another testimony to the universality of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.Under the qualitatively new international conditions  the United Nations has taken great steps towards achieving a wide range of international goals. The personal efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in furthering those goals deserve our praise and gratitude. He want the role of the United Nations and its Secretary-General to be further enhanced in the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security  understanding among nations and the political solution of regional conflicts.In recent years  we have been witness to tremendous changes in the world. This change is characterised by the emergence of an atmosphere of understanding and co-operation in East-West relations as a whole and in relations between the United States of America and the Soviet Union in particular. The democratic changes in Eastern Europe  the reunification of Germany  the democratic gains in Nicaragua and the impetus in efforts to resolve regional conflicts by peaceful means are indicators of the scope of these transformations. The continuation of this process in the light of the restructuring of international relations gives reason to hope for the establishment of a world community living together in peace  harmony and co-operation.The Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the continuing summit meetings between Soviet and United States leaders and the understandings that have been reached in those meetings  and it calls on other countries to join in the process.The Republic of Afghanistan believes that it is necessary to strengthen the regime for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We believe that the cessation of nuclear tests in the sea  underground and in the atmosphere is an important step towards general disarmament and that the United Nations is capable of promoting the process widely.We call for the elimination of stockpiles of chemical and bacteriological weapons and for the creation of nuclear-free zones in different regions of the world. The work of the Ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean and the conversion of that ocean into a zone of peace and co-operation must be expedited. We applaud any reduction in military budgets and the consequent transfer of huge funds to socio-economic development.While the international political atmosphere has improved  the present international economic order does not meet the needs of the developing and the least-developed countries.The increasing deterioration of the terms of trade  to the detriment o£ the developing countries; high interest rates and the unfavourable terms of foreign loans; the fall in the income from raw materials; and the high price of imported goods  particularly of advanced technology - these factors have further widened the gap between the developed and the developing countries. This calls for the introduction of reasonable changes in international economic relations.For more than a decade Afghanistan - a war-stricken  least-developed and land-locked country - has received no assistance or credits from a number of countries and international financial organisations. That is why we welcome the results achieved at the eighteenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly  devoted to International Economic Co-operation  in particular the Revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries  and at the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which was held in Paris in September 1990. We call for the solution of the existing problems in international economic relations and for specific action by the United Nations.The Republic of Afghanistan has followed with great concern the recent grave developments in the Gulf region. As a Muslim country  we are concerned at the negative effect that these developments have had on the unity of the Arab world. They have also provided grounds for military confrontation in this sensitive region. As a country that  unfortunately  has gone through a decade of war  we are aware of the human suffering and material destruction that war can bring about. Therefore  we earnestly hope that the explosive situation in the region will be resolved by peaceful  political means. We urge the Arab and international communities to exert every effort to find a peaceful solution. Such a solution would be in the interests of all sides. War should be avoided by all possible means.In the Middle East  the occupation of Arab and Palestinian lands  including Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights  continues. We support the Palestinian intifadah and condemn the illegal settlement of Jewish refugees in the occupied lands. He call for the convening of an international conference in which all the sides concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  would participate on an equal footing. We welcome recent improvements in the relations between the two Islamic countries of Iran and Iraq.The Republic of Afghanistan supports the unity  national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and wants to see the Lebanese people given the chance to put an end to the civil war without foreign intervention. The Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the good offices of the United Nations for the settlement of the Cyprus problem in conformity with Security Council resolution S49 (1990).The Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the latest accords resulting from the Jakarta talks on the political settlement of the Kampuchean problem and supports the participation of the United Nations in the process. In this regard  we should like to see a resolution adopted unanimously at the current session of the General Assembly.We welcome the unification of Yemen  and we support the reunification of the Korean peninsula  in accordance with the desire and will of its people  without interference from the outside.In Latin America  we support the continuation of the talks aimed at the political settlement of the situation in El Salvador.While welcoming the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and the beginning of talks between the African National Congress of South Africa and the South African Government  we note that the abhorrent apartheid regime has not yet been dismantled. We believe that further dialogue can lead to a political and peaceful solution of the situation in South Africa.We stress the need for continued talks between the POLISARIO Front and the Government of Morocco and for their joint co-operation with the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.Despite our earnest wishes and specific  practical efforts  and despite the very welcome improvement in the world atmosphere  the situation in our region is far from desirable. In fact  it has deteriorated further. The intensification of interference and aggression and the rude sabotaging of the Geneva Agreements not only has turned Afghanistan into a bleeding wound for the Afghans but also poses a serious menace to peace and stability in our region. In blatant violation of the agreements and with disregard for the good will of the Republic of Afghanistan  which wants to achieve peace and good-neighbourly relations based on non-interference by countries in each other's internal affairs  Pakistan retains on its territory all the ways and means of interference and aggression against the Republic of Afghanistan. In fact  by spreading new types of weapons of mass annihilation  such as cluster rockets  it has given the war a new dimension and a new quality.The armed extremists - people trained and armed in Pakistan - continue to massacre inhabitants of cities  with total disregard for human and moral norms. From 19 January to 22 September 1990 alone  1 662 rockets were fired on different parts of Kabul city. As a result  74 women  115 children  225 elderly people  36 teachers and students  76 public-service personnel  1 physician  112 peddlers  39 Government employees  and others - totalling 728 persons - were killed. The persons injured in these incidents include 21 women  112 children  90 elderly people  11 students  36 public-service personnel  5 physicians  640 peddlers  and others - totalling 954.As a result of rocket fire during this period  155 residential houses  8 mosques  1 hospital  2 colleges  1 girls' school  the steam house of the third micro-rayon and 1 high school were destroyed. The private enterprises that have been damaged by rockets include a confectionary factory situated in the industrial park  where 3 workers were killed and 20 others were severely injured. City bus stops are not safe from opposition fire either.  On 10 October 1988 when a rocket landed on the Timor Shahi bus stop in Kabul City  25 women  children and young persons were killed and another 78 injured. Another shocking incident was the shooting of rockets by the opposition on the Khair Khana bus stop which caused the death of 30 persons and injuries to 81 others.Among the numerous shocking  sorrowful and sad incidents of opposition rocketry are the destruction of residential houses which have caused either the total or the partial elimination of the families living in them. In a rocket incident on 21 May 1990 in Deh Bori area  the third district of Kabul City  the house of Maliha  daughter of Mohammad Zaman  was destroyed. Shah Hali  her husband  and Hadia and Khatera  her daughters  were killed. Khaled  her son  and Hasira  her daughter  were severely injured and disabled. In another rocket incident  in the Etefag mosque of Shall Shaheed  Kabul City  three daughters and a son of Mohammad Naser  named Pari  Nooria  Fahima and Kawoon were killed.Such is the everyday  painful destiny of our children  women and youth who are swallowed by death. In the name of human rights  freedom  democracy and justice  we should devote all our efforts to putting an end to the horrible tragedy of Afghans killing Afghans in a war  the futility of which is evident to all. The cessation of the tragedy of Afghanistan and help for rebuilding the country should not be made conditional on developments in Eastern Europe  on the Gulf crisis and on ending other regional conflicts  because for over a decade our country has been a scene of confrontation.In the past 10 years war has inflicted huge material and human losses on our country. The total losses amount to billions of dollars. The war has left behind 1 million killed and over a million wounded. A considerable number of our compatriots have taken refuge owing to the pain and misery of war. For this very reason the people of Afghanistan have become fed up with the war and it was to answer this substantial need of the Afghan people that we declared the policy of national reconciliation.We know from whence come the lethal weapons which are stockpiled on the territory of Pakistan and are then dispatched to the Republic of Afghanistan to bring death and destruction. However  the Geneva Agreements in particular and international law in general forbid Pakistan to give refuge to the opponents of its neighbouring country  and to equip and send then for the brutal killing of the inhabitants of its neighbour. He signed the Geneva Agreements for the termination of such interference  not for its intensification. The Republic of Afghanistan notified the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and Pakistan (OSGAP) about these aggressive acts by 1 545 notes  reporting 11 657 cases of violations. We do not know how many more notes are required to complete the list of violations and how many more Afghans will fall victim to this imposed war in order to quench the thirst of the designers of the policy of force and military pressure. In our opinion  the mandate of OSGAP should be organised in such a way as to handle the task required by the Geneva agreements.The military circles of Pakistan  who have time and time again sabotaged the democratic will of the people of Pakistan  have also arrogated unto themselves the right to talk on behalf of the Afghan opposition controlled by them. However  the assertion that the people of Afghanistan are not ready for peace and national reconciliation is a manifestation of the designs of those circles and is not a reflection of the will of the Afghan people  who  after a decade of suffering from war and destruction  desire nothing more than peace. In fact  in the years 1989 and 1990 as a result of contacts between the Government and various commanders of the armed  opposition groups inside the country  over 922 armed and unarmed groups comprising 88 269 armed men have given up war. Protocols have been signed with 604 armed and unarmed groups of 114 332 men on ceasing combat activities. Talks are being carried on with 109 groups of 17 411 armed men and 35 381 warmed men. Indeed  talks on national accord between the State and the leadership of almost all the opposition groups have been continuing discreetly for quite some time. We hope that sooner rather than later these talks will come into the open  culminating in full inter-Afghan understanding. It is also our hope that our neighbours will assist in facilitating these talks rather than stand in their way. Unfortunately  however  the attitude of those in the Pakistani military circles as a factor of instability in our region remains unchanged. Hot only in Afghanistan but also in India's Kashmir and Punjab they continue to interfere in the internal affairs of their neighbours.	While international efforts are directed towards solving regional conflicts  including the situation in Afghanistan  we regret the fact that Saudi Arabia's attitude of complicating the situation in our country remains unchanged. Even with the crisis in the Gulf region  in which the country is also involved  we have recently witnessed fresh steps on its part towards encouraging tension in our country. He believe Saudi Arabia could and should concentrate its efforts on resolving differences which  unfortunately  exist among Islamic and Arab countries and on putting an end to the fratricidal war in Afghanistan.The Republic of Afghanistan has lately proposed a new mechanism for peace  the main points of which are the followings in the first stage  a period for cooling down the situation is envisaged in order to provide the prerequisites for talks on topics that include a referendum  a general or partial cease-fire and the return of refugees. With the beginning of negotiations between the conciliating sides a transitional period would start and would last until the formation of a new  elected government. During this period  a national peace conference could be called and the co-ordinating commission for elections and the commission for drafting the constitution and the law on elections would be set up in order to draft the said laws. The Loya Jirgah  as Grand Assembly  would approve the new constitution and elect the President of the Republic. Parliamentary elections would be held on the basis of general  free  equal  secret and direct ballot and an elected government would be formed. The Republic of Afghanistan stands ready to accept United Nations-supervised elections.In order to solve the external aspect of the situation related to Afghanistan  United Nations-sponsored international conference could be held to reach an agreement on stopping the supply of arms to the warring sides  to determine the permanent neutral and demilitarised status of Afghanistan and to provide for international assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Republic of Afghanistan is of the opinion that proposals for a political and peaceful solution of the Afghanistan issue could be different  but its most important elements should be a cease-fire  intra-Afghan dialogue and free and democratic elections. The political settlement should have a constant  comprehensive and just characteristic and should be organised on the basis of the existing realities of Afghan society.It is unrealistic to give the same  parallel status to the position of the Republic of Afghanistan and to that of the opposition.' In stark contrast to the position of the opposition  the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan has ruled out a military solution  having proclaimed the policy of national reconciliation which it puts into effect persistently. The Government of the Republic of Afghanistan on several occasions has put forward specific constructive proposals in this regard. It has declared unilateral cease-fires  calling on the other side to adopt a similar approach. The opposition  however  has rejected those proposals  issuing ultimatums and demanding the transfer of political power to them with the total negation of the Homeland Party. The irrational stand of the opposition has left the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan with no choice but to defend itself. Thus the responsibility for the continuation of fratricidal war rests with the leaders of the opposition and their supporters and sponsors.To the State of the Republic of Afghanistan  its leadership and the Homeland Party no interests or privileges have priority over the supreme national interests of the people of Afghanistan  the ensuring of peace and the reconstruction of the country. Vast national efforts and huge international assistance are necessary for the reconstruction of our devastated  war-stricken country. It is a deeply humanistic obligation to co-operate with a country that has suffered heavily from war.In the difficult conditions of the continuation of the war and its intensification  the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan is carrying out great and constructive tasks. Decisively staying away from the unsound line of past leadership  it follows a policy that is in conformity with the realities of Afghan society. It is deeply faithful to the sacred religion of Islam. The free market economy is currently dominant in the country. Fundamental measures are being taken to democratize the country's political life and to observe the principles and norms of human rights. Our efforts and achievements in this regard have been reflected in the reports of the Special Reporter of the Commission on Human Rights  Professor Feliz Eraacora  to the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session and to the Commission at its forty-sixth session. Concerning the human rights question  the doors o£ our country are open  not only to the Special Reporter: non-governmental organizations such as Asia Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross also enjoy our full co-operation. As a result of those measures the authority and influence of the State have been further enhanced and it has demonstrated its capability to survive.While welcoming the efforts made by the international community and by the countries concerned and the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States of America as guarantors of the Geneva Agreements towards resolving this issue through political means  we reiterate that the key to the restoration of peace is in the hands of Afghans themselves  who can attain it through talks and dialogue.If an improvement in the stand of the United States regarding the political solution of the Afghan issue is possible and probable  it is our hope that its practical manifestation would soon become evident and that the United States policy can play an effective contributing role in ensuring peace in our region. At the same time  Pakistan's position vis-à-vis the situation in Afghanistan must not stand in the way of United States policy  postponing the solution of the situation because of its political designs.As an Islamic and non-aligned country and because of its sensitive strategic location in the heart of Asia  the Republic of Afghanistan calls for the further expansion of relations with all the countries of the world  particularly Islamic and neighbouring countries. These relations should be based on the principles of good-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of each other  and mutually beneficial co-operation in different spheres for coexistence  peace  disarmament  development and the reduction of international tension. We believe that the expansion of the consolidation of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran - a brotherly neighbouring country with which we enjoy deep religious  historical and cultural relations - is in line with the interest of our peoples and the people of the region. While we are in favour of friendly relations with our great neighbour  China  we expect it to contribute further to ensuring peace in our country. The Republic of Afghanistan is for improving our relation with our neighbour  Pakistan  and we believe that such an improvement is in the interest of our peoples and of peace and security in our region.Our traditionally friendly relations and economic co-operation with the Soviet Union and India are developing and expanding to our satisfaction. The Republic of Afghanistan receives sufficient economic assistance from the Soviet Union on the basis of bilateral agreements and international norms which plays a significant role in improving economic conditions of our country and the stability of the situation in our region.I would like once again to draw the attention of the world public to the point that  as far as the Republic of Afghanistan is concerned  there is no obstacle to the voluntary return of the Afghan refugees to their ancestral country. Availing myself of this opportunity  I would like to express my thanks to Mr. Sadruddin Agha Khan  Co-ordinator of the United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance to the People of Afghanistan and to Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  for their efforts to assist the Afghan returnees. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to the Heads of the World Health Organization  the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations for their assistance.In the course of the implementation of the plan of the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Co-ordinator for the return of 40 000 families of Afghan refugees - 250 000 persons - in a period of three months  it has become evident that the irreconcilable armed extremist groups and the military intelligence circles of Pakistan  particularly after the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto's government  create serious obstacles to the implementation of the programme. The establishment of Jam post located on the Torkhan-Peshawar main road belonging to the Khales group Shah Gai post in Ali Masjid  Khaiber agency  belonging to Gulbuddin group and Meechi post in Lowar Gai  Khaiber agency  belonging to Wahabi Sayaf and the creation of a 30-member mobile post attached to Gulbuddin’s extremist group have not only hampered the return of refugees; they have also led to arresting and interrogating refugees and plundering the property of refugees who have registered for repatriation. Mining of the routes by the opposition is another serious hurdle in the way of repatriation. For instance  the return of refugees has been stopped owing to the mining of routes in Kandahar Province.Our opponents do not even have mercy on the personnel of relief agencies and international organizations that have rushed to help the Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They threaten  loot and even kill them. The international community should therefore exert pressure on Pakistan not to hamper the implementation of the UNHCR programme.The Republic of Afghanistan is situated in a region that has been turned into one of the dangerous centres on the illicit cultivation  production  processing and trafficking of narcotic drugs. The fact is that the continuation of war against the Republic of Afghanistan and the wide participation of the leaders of the Afghan opposition groups based in Pakistan and some Pakistani circles have given an extensive dimension to this grave situation. The leaders of Afghan opposition groups not only do not deny their contribution to the smuggling of narcotic drugs; but they consider it the source of financing for the so-called Jihad - Holy War - against the Muslim people of Afghanistan. The illicit cultivation  production  smuggling and trafficking of narcotic drugs  which are also tied in with the smuggling of weapons and terrorism  pose a serious threat not only to our country and our region but also to the present and future generations of Europe and the United States of America. To combat this threat requires the joint efforts of all countries  the United Nations Organization and its specialised agencies.Although facing difficult economic conditions and a complicated military situation arising from intervention and aggression by Pakistan  the Republic of Afghanistan has taken specific steps to attack the problem. We have formed a high commission to combat the production  smuggling and use of narcotic drugs and we have approved a national programme to this effect.In the course of the last four years  the organs for the struggle against narcotic drugs have seized and eliminated 9 432.1 kilograms of opium  10 231.7 kilograms of hashish and 13 316 kilograms of heroin. Similarly  134 arrests have been made in the course oil five months and narcotics crops cultivated in hundreds of hectares of land have been destroyed. The Republic of Afghanistan has already presented proposals for joining the efforts of various countries and the United Nations in combating narcotic drugs. I would like to bring them to the attention of the international community.We propose that a special commission should be set up to draw up a comprehensive plan of action to eliminate and prevent the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan known as the Golden Crescent  where 80 per cent of the world's opium is produced. A commission of that kind could be formed with the participation of the Republic of Afghanistan and the neighbouring countries  and also of representatives of the Western European countries and the United States.I would like to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations and also the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) for drawing the attention of other countries to the matter of the establishment of this commission. We expect the United Nations to take practical steps in this direction.I should like to reiterate the proposal of the Republic of Afghanistan on holding a regional conference and on reaching regional agreements acceptable to all sides with a view to intensifying the campaign against narcotic drugs  with the participation of experts from the interested countries in the region  the Western European countries  the United States of America and the United Nations related specialised agencies  under the supervision of the United Nations and with its co-operation. In addition  I propose that an office of UNFDAC should be set up in Afghanistan in order to co-operate closely with the Government of Afghanistan and assist it in combating narcotic drugs.In conclusion  allow me once again to express the loyalty and commitment of the Republic of Afghanistan to the principles and objectives of the Charter. I am confident that under your leadership  Mr. President  the discussions of the current sessions  which have been free of ideological influences  and the decisions and resolutions of this session  while I hope will be adopted with full backing  will play a significant role in the emergence of greater understanding and co-operation between the nations  of the world  in the finding of solutions to the problems facing the world community  and in creating a safer world for us all to live in. The delegation of Afghanistan is prepared to render you all co-operation in achieving these goals."
"2",59,"AGO",45,1990,"﻿First I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session and to join those who spoke before me in wishing you success.Even though the international community is more hopeful today about finding the most efficient ways and means in the guest for justice  peace  understanding and co-operation  we know that the task of leading our proceedings is a hard one. Nevertheless  your wisdom  diplomatic experience and capability  as well as your personal dedication  are an assurance that the work of this session will be most successful.Allow me  therefore  to express  on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and on my own behalf  the trust  we have in you  and to assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation.Allow me also to congratulate the outgoing President  His Excellency General Joseph Garba  on the excellent work carried out during the forty-fourth session. The success of the sixteenth special session  devoted to the subject of apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa  and of the eighteenth special session  on international economic co-operation  particularly for the recovery of economic growth and development in the developing countries  is unequivocal proof of the dedication and capability that have always characterized him.The current trend towards détente in international relations has resulted in important steps aimed at solving some of the major problems of concern to the international community  thanks to the efforts made during the past few years  when the cold war has been increasingly replaced by dialogue  and the use of force in relations between States has been losing ground to the settlement of conflicts through negotiation.In this connection  we salute Namibia's accession to independence  an event that marked the end of the era of traditional colonialism on the African continent.We also welcome the unification of Germany  a country with which we have always had friendly relations. My Government will spare no effort to maintain and strengthen those ties of co-operation.These historic events are occurring concurrently with others which have a profound significance for Africa and the world: the freeing of Dr. Nelson Mandela  the legalisation of anti-apartheid political organizations and the transformations taking place in South Africa with a view to the abolition of the policy of racial segregation. All these are signs of the new environment in which we are living and of hope for a better future.However  elements of instability persist in southern Africa. We are referring to the situation of violence which obtains in South Africa  supported and encouraged by the police.We are also referring to the conflicts in Angola and Mozambique  where peace efforts are being opposed by external interference  whose only reason for being lies in the outmoded policies of bloc confrontation.In the case of Angolan  the summit meeting held one year ago at Gbadolite had created hopes for peace that quickly disappeared as a result of the continued support given to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) by the United States and by South African conservative circles.Throughout this period  the Government of Angola has reaffirmed its dedication to go on with peace efforts through the dialogue aimed at national unity and reconciliation among all Angolans. It was in that contest that concessions were made in Gbadolite and on other occasions.The same cannot be said of UNITA  which not only has deliberately violated and later unilaterally denounced the commitments made at Gbadolite but also has intensified its acts of war  particularly against the economic and social infrastructure  and has kidnapped and murdered defenceless civilians. Nevertheless  the Government of Angola continued to bet on peace and therefore has decided to establish direct contacts with UNITA.Notwithstanding that flexibility  the continued foreign interference and the position of UNITA vis-à-vis the Angolan Government's proposals for achieving peace Lave been the obstacles that prevented the four rounds of direct talks already held under the auspices of the Government of Portugal from producing the expected results.The failure of the fourth round of direct talks was due to UNITA’s unjustified demand to be explicitly recognised as an opposition political party. The Angolan Government has already established the principle of constitutional revision and of a multi-party system in Angola under peaceful conditions  proposing a temporary status for UNITA that  once agreed to by that group  would take effect with the signing of the cease-fire. Once a multi-party system has been instituted  all political forces would conduct their activities legally under the Political Parties Law  to be approved by the competent State authorities. Therefore  it is wrong to demand the status of an opposition political party in the present circumstances  not only because it violates the present legal and constitutional order  recognised by UMITA during the second round of negotiations  but also because nowhere in the world does an official opposition party possess an army of its own.The attempt to blame the Angolan Government for the failure of the fourth round is intended simply to manipulate public opinion and justify additional aid to UNITA for continuing the war in Angola. Unfortunately the political  economic and military might of the United States continues to influence Angola's internal conflict  contrary to the commitments made by United States authorities during the negotiation process that led to the New York agreements on peace in south-western Africa.It is not inappropriate to emphasise the seriousness demonstrated by the Government of the People's Republic of Angola in the process that facilitated the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  making it possible to eliminate the tension point represented by the Namibian conflict. At the same time  it would be unfair not to recognise the important role played by the Cuban Government for peace in south-Western Africa.Angola and Cuba continue to abide by their commitments on the phased withdrawal of troops from Angola  in a process that has already resulted in the departure of more than 38 000 soldiers in a shorter period of time than had been agreed upon.The war situation in the People's Republic of Angola is made worse by natural disasters  particularly the drought that has been afflicting some central and southern regions of the country for about four years  with serious material damage and loss of human life. According to present estimates about 3.5 million people are in need of emergency food aid and 2.2 million of them are suffering the effects of the drought.We are grateful for the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in mobilizing emergency aid to Angola  and we thank the international community for alleviating the suffering of the stricken populations.However  in the face of the difficulties and limitations inherent in the country's economic underdevelopment  the Angolan Government is unable to cope with that natural disaster by means of its own resources  and for that reason it is renewing its appeal for international aid.Given the interdependence that exists nowadays in the world  no country can remain indifferent to problems that affect humanity. The People's Republic of Angola takes a keen interest in the events taking place in various parts of the globe.The latest developments in Western Sahara show that some positive steps are being taken to break the present stalemate. The Government of the People's Republic of Angola reaffirms the right of the Saharan people to self-determination and encourages the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front to proceed with negotiations and congratulates the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the efforts he has undertaken  together with the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  to organize a referendum that can bring an early settlement of the conflict.The continued illegal occupation of the Territory of East Timor is unacceptable  unjustifiable and a violation of the norms and principles of international law  especially when it is perpetrated by a country which in the past has itself been a victim of colonialism and which has made an important contribution to the struggle of colonized peoples for their emancipation. My Government advocates the path of dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia  including representatives of the people of East Timor  as the way to find a fair and comprehensive solution that will take account of the legitimate rights of the Maubere people.Prospects in the Middle East are not encouraging in so far as finding an early resolution of the Israeli-Arab conflict is concerned. We believe that settling Jews in occupied Arab territories will not help in any way to bring an honourable end to that conflict. The Government of the People's Republic of Angola considers it imperative to convene an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)  the authentic representative of the Palestinian people  which has for decades been struggling for its right to self-determination.We cannot fail to mention the crisis that recently arose in the Persian Gulf. When everything points to a realisation that resorting to the use of force is not the most efficient way or means of resolving conflicts  we are surprised by the events in that part of our globe with the invasion oil Kuwait by Iraq - soma thing we emphatically condemn  especially since Kuwait is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement which  since its establishment  has defended the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force in international relations.Therefore the parties involved must honour the resolutions of the Security Council and It is imperative that Iraqi troops should be withdrawn from Kuwait in order to facilitate a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the conflict.With regard to Central America  we reaffirm that the peoples of the region must freely decide their destiny; there must be no external interference through support given to irregular armed groups  through direct military Intervention or through a war of information whose object is to overthrow legitimately constituted Governments. In Cambodia the continued armed actions from neighbouring territories will not advance the search for a peace agreement. My government believe that a peaceful resolution to the conflict necessarily requires the cessation of all foreign interference and respect for the country’s independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status.   On the subject of Korea  my Government supports the steps taken towards the reunification of the two parts of that country and the removal of foreign bases and troops from the peninsula. The recent proposals aimed at the holding of a conference during a first phase constitute a positive sign that deserves the fullest support from the international community  for no matter what manoeuvres are resorted to  a people with a single identity will never remain divided.At the beginning of the last decade  we declared from this rostrum our firm desire to improve the global economic environment  and we likewise committed ourselves to strengthening international economic co-operation in order to conquer hunger  poverty  malnutrition and epidemics - that is  to overcome the problems of underdevelopment and give more dignity to a man’s existence.Today  as we enter the last decade of the twentieth century  we should reflect on what was our commitment to searching for solutions to the critical international economic situation  which affects the developing countries mort of all. Therefore  it is only right to raise some concerns Must we have images of hunger and poverty continue to appear in the world of our discussions in order to remind us of the imbalance and injustice of the present international economic system? Do we need to repeat at every stop that four fifth· of the world's population possesses only one fifth of its total wealth  manages only 10 per cent of the world’s industrial output and controls no more than 2 to 3 per cent of the total research efforts in the world? What specific joint measures did we take to prevent the gap between the developing and the developed countries from reaching today’s proportions?When the recant special session  of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation analysed the results achieved  during the past decade  it found that the problem which had already caused concern to the countries of the so-called third world at the start of the decade were still present.The target level of official development aid to the developing countries  fixed at 0.7 per cent of the industrialised countries gross national product (GDP)  was attained only by a small group of countries  and the general figure was only 0.35 per cent. In international trade we continue to witness a surge of protectionism practised by the developed countries  e decline in the prices of raw materials and a deterioration of the terms of trade  whose effects seriously compromise all the efforts made by the  developing countries to revive their economies.To aggravate this picture  the foreign debt of the developing countries has been constantly increasing  reaching the monumental sum of $1 320 billion at the end of last year; that amount cannot be paid without inevitably diminishing the investment capacity of those countries.In our view  the basic question lies in the need for a political will  both on the part of the developing countries and on the part of the developed countries  as the only way to avoid a reproduction of the system that generated the inequalities and injustices.While it is true that in order to overcome the challenges of the world economic situation  the developing countries have to adopt more appropriate strategies geared to readjusting their economies  it is equally true that the developed countries should adopt acre constructive attitudes.More recently^ with the ongoing transformations is Eastern Europe we have witnessed what could be called ""conditionalism"" in connection with official development aid from the countries of Western Europe.For the Government of the People's Republic of Angola  the economic evolution occurring in the countries of Eastern Europe should signify a more active participation by those countries in the world economy  so that they may make a greater contribution to the improvement of North-South relations.In the particular case of Africa  the changes taking place in Eastern Europe should serve as an incentive to other Industrialised countries to give greater support to African countries  taking account of the ongoing policies of structural adjustment aimed at the recovery of their economies  instead of opting for measures that would further worsen their participation in the expansion of the world economy.Moreover  in the face of the inadequate results achieved in implementing the United Nations programme for the economic recovery of Africa  the international community has seen the birth of a new plan that requires greater flexibility on the part of donors.In southern Africa  with the accession of Namibia to independence and the beginning of the process that will lead to negotiations between anti-apartheid organisations and the South African Government  new prospects are opening for the region's development.The member countries of the Co-ordination Conference for the Development of Southern Africa  in its tenth year of existence are entering a new phase in the development efforts that will need the growing support of the international community.Important events have taken place and will take place during the present decade. A few days ago the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries ended at Paris with encouraging - albeit partial - results. Its convening constitutes one more opportunity to seek solutions to the pressing problems faced by that group of countries. The cancellation of their foreign debts by the industrialised creditor countries should be considered one of the most urgent and necessary measures for achieving that end.The World Summit for Children  held on 29 and 30 September  accurately analysed the problems that beset the world's children and it recommended appropriate measures for their protection. The People's Republic of Angola reaffirms its most fir  commitment to such principles and will do its utmost to improve the living conditions of children. In addition  the eight United nations conference on development will take place in 1991  in 1992 there will be a conference on environment and development  and in 1994 a conference of population. At those important forums an efforts will be made to continue the debate begun at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation. The results we expect from those meetings should become a foundation for re-establishing trust among nations.  "
"3",106,"ALB",45,1990,"﻿It is a special pleasure for me to speak at this session of the General Assembly  which also marks the forty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Likewise  it is an honour for me to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to the lofty post of the presidency of the General Assembly and to wish you every success in fulfilling this noble task.We have come to this important meeting with the desire to contribute  within our possibilities  to the strengthening of the spirit of international co-operation and the safeguarding of peace and security for all countries and peoples  big or small.The year that has elapsed since the meeting of the previous session of the General Assembly was replete with events which at times inspired hope and at other times were threatening. However  in the final analysis  there is hope that at last - on the eve of the twenty-first century - mankind will achieve the solution to conflicts by reason instead of force  co-operation instead of confrontation and understanding instead of mistrust. It is very encouraging to see that  despite many difficulties  the concept is gaining ground that the security of peoples and nations can be real and permanent only if general security is established for all  just as political detente can have a solid basis only if the gap of unequal economic development among various countries is narrowed and if the poorer countries are assisted in embarking upon the road to modern development and the utilization of the material and spiritual values of our time.Certainly  the various political  ideological  economic and social conflicts have not abated  nor have the causes and factors which gave rise to them been eliminated. Nevertheless  what is important is that a general consensus is emerging to the effect that international problems cannot be solved  nor can threats and dangers to peace and general security be eliminated  through old concepts and methods.We should like to consider the process of the easing of tension - if it is to be crystallized and further affirmed with the active participation of the entire international community - not only as a major achievement  but also as a fundamental positive change in the building of new international relations.In our view  what is happening currently in Europe  and what has taken on the name of the process of security and co-operation in Europe  is proceeding in that direction. Europe  with the situation on that continent and the relations among its nations and peoples  has been  at least up to this day  the source of most of the positive or negative developments in the world.The hotbeds of the major conflicts  which then set the whole world afire  had their source here  just as did the origins of major political  ideological and cultural currents which have predominated over the centuries. From the great European wars - with all their suffering and superhuman sacrifices - from the reflection of all European tragedies  illusions and disillusions  bold and noble initiatives have emerged to ensure that the peoples and nations of Europe may live together in peace and friendship.Mine is a small country. The Albanian people  however  are among the most ancient inhabitants of the European continent. During the thousands of years of their existence  they have never attacked anybody  never provoked any aggressive war  never threatened or encroached upon the security of their neighbours. On the contrary  they have gone through flames and fire in order to preserve their existence and assist others. George Kastrioti-Skanderbeg  our national hero of the fifteenth century  has been and remains the symbol not only of the brilliant fighter for the defence of his own people  but also the first champion of European humanism and civilization. History has not blessed the Albanian people  either in ancient or in modern times. But it has taught them that  for their freedom  independence  national sovereignty  originality and identity to be protected  they must boldly fight against and oppose any attempt to infringe these  just as it has taught them to support and back up all international actions and initiatives that contribute to the strengthening of peace and general security.We based ourselves on this necessity  this reality  and this objective  when we opposed the policies of military blocs and divisions into spheres of influence  closed markets and neo-colonialist policies  the arms race and  in general  policies of interference  arbitrariness and diktat.We have been  and continue to be  in favour of the democratization of international relations so that the voice of all countries is listened to and taken into account. It is true that the great Powers have special responsibilities for the maintenance and strengthening of peace. This  however  does not give them the right to dictate and impose a peace in accordance with their particular interests and political and ideological criteria. The norms of international relations  the position of States in their relations with one another and the maintenance of peace must be the fruit of the thought  experience and contribution of the entire international community and the consensus of all peoples.In this context  we cannot fail to evaluate and consider as promising the changes that have taken place in the relations between the United States of America and the Soviet Union  the agreements they have concluded on disarmament and  in general  the way in which they view mutual and general security. If détente between the two super-Powers were to become global and extend to other fields - apart from that of armaments - this would be to the benefit of all.Nevertheless  in the situation in which we find ourselves now we cannot say that the policies and practices produced by the bloc concepts have been overcome. Worse still  the arrogance inspired by the policy of strength  which is reflected in the continuation of attempts at imposing various models  standards and schemes of political or social development on others has not been relinquished either. Life has shown that pressure to make these standards and schemes compulsory for all countries has led to conflicts from which the world is suffering to this day.Albania has followed with keen attention and hailed without hesitation the democratic processes now under way in Europe. We consider the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) - and our country has joined that Conference and has already taken part in a number of its activities - to be particularly important.The Albanian people have at all times and in all ages shared the fate of the peoples of this continent. Precisely for that reason Albania regards itself as an active participant in the processes that are unfolding in Europe. It looks forward with interest to the Paris summit which  proceeding from the basic Helsinki Act and other CSCE documents  will decide on institutionalization of the CSCE. Albania  which hopes to be a full participant in the Paris summit  will work in the spirit of the obligations deriving from it. All the efforts  initiatives or ideas aimed at liquidating the division of Europe into blocs and spheres of influence  or other forms inherited from the past  while respecting the freedom  independence and sovereignty of all peoples and countries  have the unreserved support of our country. Any proposal for and step towards the easing of tension  the strengthening of peace through dialogue and understanding  in complete equity and with mutual respect  and any decision or suggestion which might help defend human rights and national and democratic freedoms will also4have our full support.The changes now taking place in Central and Eastern Europe  the complex and still-ill-defined situations that are being created in that large region  and the new and varied differences that are emerging - and one does not know the forms they will take nor their consequences - call for serious and wise reflection and action on the part of us all. The mere exaltation of democracy and human rights cannot be the magic key to the solution of the major  indeed we would say the dramatic  problems of those countries. It is obvious that in some countries this exaltation is leading to anarchy  decline and the degradation of political  social and economic life  and conflicts and clashes which could lead to civil war.Like all countries of the world  the European countries too are at different levels of economic  social and other spheres of development  which are the result of their different historical roads of development and which  taken together  have also determined and conditioned their political way of life.It would be desirable for all European countries to be at the same economic  political and cultural level. However  in our opinion  that cannot be attained  and contradictions and conflicts cannot be eliminated only by giving advice  no matter how wise it may be.Life has shown that without the economic development of all countries  without fruitful co-operation that creates possibilities of advancement for others also  and without establishing among States sincere and equitable relations that exclude prejudice and interference in internal affairs of any kind  genuine security cannot be achieved  nor can democratic  progressive and permanent community among European peoples be created.Changes in Europe have also led to the reunification of Germany  eliminating one of the most acute problems to have dominated European political affairs in the past 45 years. The right of the German nation to be reunited is a right that cannot be denied. The solution to such problems as that of the peaceful unification of Germany is also a good example for dealing with other problems of this kind which history has left for us to solve. Such solutions also contribute greatly to the democratization of international relations  the strengthening of peace and security and the creation of conditions for sincere and constructive co-operation among peoples.Albania sincerely wishes that united Germany  which will be a great economic and political Power  will constitute a factor for peace and stability in Europe and elsewhere and help create a better future for our old continent.In the context of the process of European co-operation and security  regional co-operation is also assuming particular importance. That is true of the process of Balkan co-operation  to which Albania attaches special importance; Albania is making every effort to make a maximum contribution to its advancement and success. We are fully convinced that this process not only assists in the strengthening of security and co-operation in that very sensitive region but also directly serves the cause of peace and stability in Europe and in the Mediterranean.However  the Balkans also have their specific problems  which have caused them to lag behind in many respects and have prevented them from following current European trends and from being integrated into our continent.The fundamental problem or  rather  the source of all conflicts  squabbles and hatred among the Balkan States during this century  has been that of national minorities. It is high time for the Balkan countries - and the democratic processes taking place in Europe and the whole world call for this - to tackle this problem with wisdom  realism and objectiveness. However complicated and difficult it may appear  if they set themselves the goal of transforming the minorities from a bone of contention into a bridge for communication and co-operation  ways and means of settling this problem can be found.As far as Albania is concerned  it has the necessary good will and is prepared to make its contribution to the advancement of Balkan co-operation democratically so that it may serve the vital interests of the peoples of that peninsula.One of the more acute and more disquieting problems in the Balkans today is that of the Albanians in Yugoslavia  with regard to whom the Government of Serbia is pursuing an open policy of genocide  which has been affirmed at many international forums and brought to the attention of world public opinion.In Kosovo and other regions of Yugoslavia where Albanians live  crimes are being committed that would have been considered monstrous even in the dark days of the Middle Ages. The main point is not that Albanians are being denied their fundamental human rights  and  as is already known to all  are being violated most barbarically  but that Albanians are being denied their right to exist  their right to life. The illegal dissolution of the Assembly of Kosovo by Serbia  the occupation of the radio and television centre by the police  the banning of the Albanian press  the dismissal of thousands of Albanians and their replacement by Serbs are all clear expressions of the intentions of Serbian authorities to solve the problem of the Albanians through violence and terror  not dialogue.The international community cannot and should not remain indifferent to this situation - particularly Europe  which  having drawn up the map of the Balkans at the outset of this century  has not only a moral but also a historical responsibility for the martyrdom of Albanians in Yugoslavia.The Albanians in Yugoslavia  who represent the oldest indigenous population among all the peoples of that State  who are the third largest of the nations making up Yugoslavia  and who for centuries have lived on their soil in a compact territory  are demanding no more rights than are enjoyed by the Serbs  the Slovenians  the Croatians or the Macedonians. But they will accept nothing less. They want to be on an equal footing with all the other nations comprising Yugoslavia. The Albanians are demanding recognition of their right to self-determination. They want to live in a Yugoslav federation or confederation  if the other nations also favour those forms of government.The right of nations to self-determination is one of the greatest rights mankind has gained  which is why it has been sanctioned in the Charter of the United Nations and has actually been transformed into one of the basic principles of the democratic processes taking place in Europe and the world in general.As far as Albania is concerned  it is for relations of good-neighbourliness with Yugoslavia  for broader and all-around co-operation with it. We will strive for this now and in the future  and we wish reason and wisdom to prevail in the settlement of the Kosovo problem so that Serbia might not turn it into a conflict which could pose a threat to peace and security not only in Yugoslavia but also in the Balkans and beyond.The Albanian people have always sincerely wished to live in friendship with all neighbouring peoples. Albania's good relations with Yugoslavia  Greece  Italy and other countries and its closest possible co-operation on the basis of mutual respect and benefit  constitute a fundamental strategic aspect of our foreign policy.In this anniversary year of the founding of the United Nations  as we express our best wishes for its strengthening and advancement  Albania would like to reiterate its commitment to the United Nations and its Charter  and its support for the activities that the Organization carries out to the benefit of peace  security and international co-operation.Our respect for and evaluation of the Charter of the United Nations is based on its expression of a democratic ideal on the regulation of international relations  an ideal that reflects the tragic experience of the devastating wars that have swept over Europe and the entire world in the course of this century and  in particular  the struggle of peoples  the Albanian people included  against fascism.We believe the Charter of the United Nations and its proper implementation to be the best means of protecting and harmonizing the interests of sovereign States and peoples and the whole world community. If we abide by that Charter  various conflicts which flare up could be solved peacefully to the benefit of all concerned and general peace and security. In our view  the significance of the United Nations is further enhanced now that many problems - such as disarmament  environmental protection  the war against drugs  great backwardness in the economic development of many countries  the protection of children and the development of education  science and technology - have become global issues that can hardly be settled through the individual efforts of one State or group of States. They can be settled only with the contribution of the entire international community. The United Nations can do a great deal on these issues. It is the most suitable place where ideas can and should be tackled  initiatives taken  and so forth.The United Nations has rightly devoted particular attention to economic problems: assistance for reviving the economies of poor countries  for encouraging their progress and for easing their debt burden  which is a consequence of neo-colonialist expansion and the arms race. We hail the initiatives taken in those directions  such as the North-South dialogue  but maintain that the big industrialized countries  which have enriched themselves by the sweat and toil of the peoples of Africa  Latin America and Asia  have many obligations towards those peoples.Steps already taken towards easing tension and solving many regional conflicts  and efforts under way to settle many international problems of concern to the world  have created an atmosphere that gives all mankind reason for hope.But events such as Iraq's aggression against Kuwait spoil that atmosphere and raise obstacles to positive progress. Albania has condemned Iraq's aggression against and annexation of Kuwait. It has demanded  and continues to demand  the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and respect for the freedom and national independence of that sovereign and peaceful State. Had it not been condemned  Iraq's aggression would have set a dangerous precedent. Iraq must comply with United Nations resolutions and with the well-intentioned and constructive suggestions of the Arab States  and should put an end to its adventure. Withdrawal from Kuwait would benefit not only Iraq itself  but the Arab cause as a whole  which Iraq claims to defend and support.The international community has adopted a correct stand towards the Iraqi aggression. But these events should not be used as an excuse for ignoring the Palestinian problem and the right of the Palestinians to their own homeland and their own State. The international community should not forget that right  the realization of which is the key to settling the Middle East conflict. Current events in the Middle East  negative as they may be  should serve as encouragement in that direction.The Albanian people are working resolutely to build a better life for themselves. The path they have chosen of their own free will and in keeping with their own desires has brought them freedom and national independence and in the course of four decades has taken them from backwardness to modern life. The transformations that have taken place in Albania are in sharp day-and-night contrast with the past. That is no mere rhetoric  but a reality anyone can see.This great advance required sacrifice and imposed upon us privations in many areas  all the more so considering that our development was carried out through a fierce struggle against the backwardness inherited from the past and against interference by external forces. Hardly any country suffered more than Albania from the cold war. Anger  pressure  threats and blockades  sometimes from the East and sometimes from the West  have almost constantly swept our tiny country on the shores of the Adriatic. We feel their consequences to this day  just as  not infrequently  we feel their revival. Now our country has embarked upon a new stage in its development. We must make more efficient use of the material resources in which our country is rich.That requires up-to-date technology and highly-trained and emancipated people; it calls for promoting creative initiative and broader co-operation with other countries. Our people are working in all those directions.What we call the deepening of democracy through the enhancement of the role of the masses represents a broad process of change embracing all sectors: the economy  politics  social relations within the country  foreign relations and so forth. We are not following that policy because it is in vogue or because it is being imposed upon us or for tactical motives. It is a necessity for our development and it meets the needs of our country. That is why our people understand and welcome it. It is a fundamental component of our socialist ideal of building a fair and democratic society in which every citizen will live by his own sweat and toil  free and respected  on the basis of his own contribution to the development and progress of his country.I wish the General Assembly success in its work for peace  and assure you  Sir  that my country will spare no effort to help attain that lofty aim."
"4",174,"ARE",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that you will conduct the affairs of this session with the statesmanship and competence that are required for the realisation of the desired results. The wise policies of your country and the constructive role that it plays  reinforce our confidence in your abilities. It also gives me great pleasure to express our deepest thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Garba for his very able stewardship of the previous session. On this occasion  I should also like to express my Government's appreciation for the leadership and constructive efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in order to enhance the role of the Organization. Thanks to his tireless efforts  the United Nations has become an effective centre for agreement and decisions and a barrier against chaos in international relations.Since last year's session  two new States - Namibia and Liechtenstein - have become Members of the United Nations. We welcome these two new Member States and assure them of our co-operation in order to promote the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We are also happy to welcome the unification of the two Germanys  as we believe this to be a new stabilizing factor in world politics.People all over the world - east and west  north and south - warmly welcomed the emergence of a new world of co-operation  a world in which the fear of confrontation between the two super-Powers started to disappear with the ending of the cold war that characterized international order since the end of the Second World War. We  like all other States and peoples  welcomed with a great deal of optimism and hope the new spirit that pervaded international relations. The great relaxation in the relations between the two super-Powers  together with the momentous changes in Eastern Europe and the advances made in the settlement of regional conflicts  were all indications that we are on the threshold of a new world. It was the world originally conceived by the authors of the Charter - a world in which dialogue  peaceful settlement and respect for international law would reign supreme  and would become the principle that governs relations among nations and communities. That would be a world of mutual respect and co-operation in our striving for prosperity in which creativity  progress and stability would become the arenas of competition. On the Arab level  these developments had a positive impact on inter-Arab relations. A new spirit began to pervade those relations. The new climate of hope and optimism went hand in hand with efforts to formulate a new strategy of joint Arab action based on understanding  solidarity and commitment to brotherly Arab ties and Arab covenants. In pursuit of this goal  several Arab meetings were held. Other steps were taken within the framework of the Arab League in order to make preparations for holding an Arab summit conference whose purpose was to outline  for the first time  the future to which the Arab people aspire  a future where peace and prosperity prevail. One of the first fruits of the new spirit in the Arab world was the unity of the two Yemens which we joyfully welcomed.Unfortunately  our optimism was short-lived because  suddenly  the world found itself returning to the pre-United Nations era. There emerged someone who tried to obliterate 45 years of unstinting human effort to build stability and uphold the right of States and peoples to live in peace. There emerged someone who also tried to reverse all the endeavours that have been undertaken to build a brighter Arab future  and undermine the very foundations of Arab solidarity.On 2 August 1990  Iraqi forces invaded the State of Kuwait. The small and peaceful member of the international community then became a victim of brutal usurpation and occupation whose identity Iraq has tried to obliterate through annexation and systematic destruction of its institutions and infrastructures.No one expected 1990 to be the year of Arab crisis. However  it has brought with it a crisis of complex origins  far-reaching effects and devastating proportions. Above all  nobody expected one Arab State to inflict such atrocious injustice on a sister Arab State which in the past had fought side by side with it and defended its rights. Iraq's aggression against Kuwait is  above all else  a violation of the Arab code of ethics and values. It is also a breach of Arab and international principles and treaties. Irrespective of the outcome of this aggression  the Arabs will be the ultimate losers.As a responsible Arab State  the United Arab Emirates tried  with its sisterly Arab States and through the Arab League  to rectify this grave abnormality in an effort to prevent the exacerbation of the situation. However  Iraq's persistence in its aggression frustrated all collective and bilateral Arab efforts.In this regard  our delegation would like to voice its conviction that the resolutions adopted by the emergency meeting of the Arab League  along with those endorsed by the emergency Arab Summit of 10 August  especially resolution 195  reflect our commitment to Arab treaties and principles  and to the letter and spirit of the Arab League Charter. All those resolutions call for the restoration of legitimate rights to their original owners  and reversing the injustice and aggression that were inflicted upon a sovereign member State.A lot has been said in certain Arab and some international circles with regard to the presence of foreign troops in the region. It is important  therefore  that we clarify this matter.Everybody knows that my country has amicable relations with all States of the world. As a small State  we always avoided military entanglements and alliances. We also refused to grant military facilities to foreign countries on our soil. We were relying  for our national security  on all the Arab and international treaties and on the protective shield of good neighbourliness. However  having been exposed to direct threats from Iraq  as was demonstrated in the memorandum of the Iraqi Foreign Minister to the Arab League on 15 July 1990  and the statements of the Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein and his senior officials  in which they considered the Emirates to be a second target after Kuwait  our country had no option  by virtue of its limited defence capabilities  but to seek the assistance of sisterly and friendly countries. In doing that  we acted in self-defence in exercise of the right to sovereignty and collective security enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I should like  however  to emphasise here that the presence of these troops is temporary and is only linked to the present crisis  which we hope will be resolved as soon as possible.Differences between States  regardless of their causes  do not justify aggression  and should be resolved by the peaceful means specified by the Charter of the United Nations. The aggression against Kuwait is a dangerous precedent in international relations and should be confronted decisively; otherwise  the security and existence of small States will become threatened. The arguments used by Iraq to justify its aggression against Kuwait are legally  historically and morally invalid. The firm stand taken by the world community  as embodied in the successive resolutions of the Security Council  reflects the anger of the world at Iraq's aggression.Sight from the start  our country supported the resolutions of the Security Council. Once more  we demand that Iraq withdraw completely and unconditionally from the Kuwaiti territory  that the legitimate Government should be restored and that its sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected. We also demand that Iraq release all civilian hostages. All other differences should be resolved afterwards through negotiations in a manner that safeguards the legitimate rights of the State of Kuwait.From this rostrum  we appeal to all the States of the world to act resolutely and expeditiously to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait  in order to save Iraq  and its people  as well the entire region  from a disaster of immeasurable magnitude and consequences. We should like to reaffirm once again our full solidarity with the Government and people of the sister State of Kuwait in their struggle to recover their full national sovereignty.One of the fundamental facts that cannot be overlooked in all this is that Iraq would not have dared to commit such aggression had there not been an unfortunate history of conflict in the Middle East. A significant aspect of this background has been the failure of the international community to deter aggression and repel forces of occupation. This is especially true of the failure to implement Security Council and General Assembly resolutions with regard to the major conflict in the Middle East  the core of which is the Palestinian question. The acts of aggression  occupation  annexation and expulsion perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people and against the Arab front-line States have paved the way for the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. The stalemated situation in the Middle East  together with the failure to reach a peaceful settlement to the Palestinian question and guarantee the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  gave Iraq the impression that aggression  occupation and annexation are commonplace in the region and that  consequently  the world would overlook and condone them. Iraq also believed that it could do what Israel has always done by force of arms and thus face the world with a fait accompli.Iraq has tried to exploit the prevalent Arab sentiments towards the just Palestinian question to establish a link between that just cause and its unjust occupation of Kuwait. While my country condemns all acts of aggression and occupation  it sees no link between these two different cases. Regardless of the harm that the Iraqi aggression has caused to the Palestinian question and to other pan-Arab causes  our delegation firmly believes that the international community  which has exhibited unity and exercised authority in a decisive manner against the Iraqi aggression  is duty-bound to exercise the sane authority against all acts of aggression  especially Israel's aggression against and occupation of Palestine and other Arab lands. The objective is to achieve a just and durable peace and settle the Palestine question in such a way as to realise the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  foremost among which is their right to establish an independent State on their national soil in Palestine. Lebanon is another outstanding Middle East problem. Such problems partly stem from the Israeli policies of expansion and occupation. Through the Tripartite Committee  Arab efforts have almost succeeded in bringing about a final settlement to Lebanon's problems and conflicts. To bring those efforts to fruition  a united stand on the part of the international community is required to assist Lebanon and end its ordeal. Our delegation commends the progress achieved by the Tripartite Committee in its endeavours to bring about national reconciliation. We appeal to all the Lebanese parties to work diligently towards the settlement of their differences and the resolution of their problems by peaceful and democratic means  in keeping with Lebanese tradition. We also appeal to the international community to work towards ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon so that Lebanon may recover and exercise its authority over its national soil.Despite the agonies of our region  we must put on record here the positive developments which have taken place in many other regional problems. We are happy to see the Namibian question resolved  with Namibia regaining its sovereignty and independence after many years of struggle. We would like to express here our appreciation for the leading role of the United Nations and its agencies and mechanisms in the issue to this positive and democratic conclusion.We are aware of the impact of the settlement of the Namibian question on the situation in South Africa  including the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and the dawning of a new era in that country. However  we believe that we have a long way to go and that much more must be done to dismantle the system of apartheid. Despite some positive signs and the political efforts undertaken by all parties  we shall not relax until we see all repressive and racist letters completely eliminated and the majority given its full political and economic rights. We therefore hope that the international community will keep up its pressure until racism is uprooted and completely eradicated.With regard to Central America  our Government welcomes the fruitful results produced by the efforts of the Governments of that region which led  in co-operation with the Secretary-General  to the settlement of the situation in Nicaragua. We hope to see a similar positive outcome in dealing with the other outstanding problems in the region.My Government welcomes the agreement reached by the five permanent members of the Security Council at the end of last August to settle the problems of Cambodia on the basis of an active United Nations role. The fact that the parties to the conflict have accepted such a framework should encourage optimism and lead to success. We also hope that the ongoing dialogue between North Korea and South Korea will eliminate the causes underlying their differences and realize the desire of their people for unity.	It is most unfortunate that  so far  the efforts of the Secretary-General in addressing the issues of Cyprus and Afghanistan have not been crowned with success. We hope the Secretary-General will pursue his efforts in order to bring about a final solution to the two problems in a manner consistent with the desires of their peoples and the objectives and principles of the Charter.The noblest objective of the founding fathers of the Charter was the avoidance and prevention of war and the establishment of an international order of peace and security. Events  including the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait  have demonstrated that the amassing of weapons by any State in excess of its defensive needs becomes a strong incentive to use its armaments for aggression. The lure of armed force tends to weaken adherence to international law and conventions. That was amply demonstrated by the crimes committed by Iraqi forces against Kuwait. Israel is another case in point. Here again  superior military power has continued to motivate aggression against neighbouring Arab countries.This is the reason why my country has continuously and strongly supported arms control in the areas of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction. While progress has been made in that respect by the two super-Powers  no real attention has been paid to the amassing of weapons on the regional level. We believe there is a need to take necessary action to ensure arms control and prohibit the development of weapons of mass destruction  especially in the Middle East. The Kuwaiti crisis may trigger a renewed arms race in the region and increase the prospects of war and acts of aggression. We must also mention here the military arsenal of Israel  its weapons of mass destruction and  particularly  its nuclear weapons. Our country wishes to reiterate its welcome to the proposal of creating nuclear-weapon-free zones  especially in the Middle East.Since independence  my country has annually allocated a significant percentage of its gross national product for aid to the developing countries  through bilateral and multilateral assistance as well as through international financial institutions. In spite of all the pressures we have been facing as a developing country dependent on the single commodity of oil and notwithstanding that commodity's price fluctuations  we have never wavered in giving aid to the needy countries. The Abu Dhabi Fund for Economic Development continues to play a fundamental role in that respect through a number o£ financial development projects in the developing countries. The crisis in Kuwait has dealt a severe blow to international development efforts. The impact of the crisis has been tragic in the case of a number of developing countries. One consequence has been a drastic increase in the price of oil  which has inflicted further severe losses on the developing countries and sent shock waves through the global financial markets  creating a crisis of confidence among investors.The letters and memoranda received by the Security Council Committee set up in accordance with Security Council resolution 661 (1990) are sufficient proof of the damage caused by the crisis to the economies of many countries that were either directly or indirectly connected by international trade and finance to the countries of the region. There is no doubt that the numbers and the plight of displaced Arab and Asian refugees attest to the human suffering brought about by the Iraqi aggression.My country  which has given basic aid to the countries that have been affected directly  is fully prepared to take part in the international efforts to alleviate the effects of the crisis on the developing countries.In this context  we support the setting up of an international agency to work in conjunction with the Security Council committee established under resolution 661 (1990) to assess the economic damage caused by the crisis  and assist in the creation of a donor fund to which all countries may contribute to help the countries affected. My country is fully prepared to assume its responsibilities and participate in this effort to save the world from an economic disaster  since it has not been possible to avoid political catastrophe.It gives me great pleasure to announce that my country has earmarked 1 billion dollars as a contribution towards the efforts aimed at reducing the burden on third world countries caused by the Gulf crisis and the implementation of resolution 661.The attention of the world has focused as never before on the United Nations which has demonstrated that it is the international instrument capable of dealing with new crises. The last few weeks have proved that co-operation and co-ordination among the great Powers can promote international peace and security in a constructive and indispensable manner in the world of today.In spite of the grave threat the Gulf crisis has posed to international peace  the concern for international détente shown by the super-Powers through their use of the Security Council demonstrates the vital importance of this international Organization. This concern made many countries  especially the smaller ones and those which do not have all the necessary means to defend their independence  feel that the international system is able to protect them and preserve their independence. From this standpoint  our delegation commends tie United Nations on the crucial role it has played. We do consider this to be the rebirth of this international Organization  and call on all its Member States to reinforce its role  especially that of the Security Council  in the settlement of international and regional problems."
"5",221,"ARG",45,1990,"﻿At the outset  let me convey to you  Sir  my warm and heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your experience and wisdom guarantee the success of our endeavours. I would also like to convey our delegation's appreciation to General Garba  who so efficiently guided our proceedings at the forty-fourth session. We reiterate our welcome to the newly born Republic of Namibia as an independent State  thus putting an end to one of the most conflict-laden and unfair situations in recent history. We also welcome the Principality of Liechtenstein as a new State member of our Organization  and we reassure its delegation that we are willing to co-operate with it in the common purposes that guide our presence in the United Nations. During the past year we have witnessed fundamental transformations in international relations. The far-reaching changes that have taken place in the countries of Eastern Europe and the commendable improvement in East-West relations have made it possible to join international Public opinion in forecasting the end of the cold war. The reunification of Yemen has taken place. In a few days we shall witness the unification of Germanys  which will put an end to the painful period of division of its people and will solve this most glaring of the remaining issues of the Second World War in Europe. We hope that in a not-too-distant future the presence of Korea will further strengthen the universality of our Organisation. We are also witno8sing the realisation of the hope for an end to racism and discrimination in South Africa  the achievement of progress towards solving many complex situations in South-East Asia and an almost complete return to democratic rule in Latin America. These are all signs of the strengthening of the United Nations  beginning with detente and the end of the policy of opposing blocs. They also imply a renewal in the practices of United Nations organs and a return to the spirit of San Francisco  free of ideological content exemplified by an age of confrontation that we have already left behind. Here  we can but pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Peres de Guellar  whose untiring efforts have contributed in large measure to those achievements. History  however  is not linear. The enormous progress made by the international community during this past year in reconstituting the spirit of San Francisco has met a violent challenge. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq has darkened  the light of this new era. The Argentine people  together with the international community  is deeply concerned and afflicted by this episode born of aggression and of disregard for the most fundamental rules of international coexistence. My Government condemns Iraq's aggression and  in conformity with Security Council resolutions  demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the restoration of the authority of the legitimate Government of that country. Another source of concern is the situation in which the Kuwaiti people and the hundreds of thousands of foreign refugees in the area find themselves. My Government urges Iraq to apply the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols regarding the protection of civilian persons in time of war and to permit immediately all foreigners who wish to do so to leave Kuwait and Iraq. However  we believe that these expressions are not enough  because we face a new fact: the first challenge to the order that has emerged since the ending of the cold war. This is a challenge that takes us back to a Past we wish to leave behind - a past based on confrontation and the use of force which severely hampered the functioning of our Organisation. This is why we are opposed to those who propose aggression and terrorism  and in so doing we  favour the implementation of the operative mechanisms envisaged in the Charter as the sole safeguard for the less powerful countries and as theguarantee of peace for the international community. It is in that context that my Government has decided to send a force  which will join the international undertaking aimed at securing the implementation of United Nations resolutions imposing sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. This action in the part of my government confirms its resolves to assume fully its international commitments. In the building of the post-cold-war world  all members of the international community  without exception  are responsible for keeping international peace and security  in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the charter. Our endorsement of the principle of the peaceful settlements of disputes applies to another issue  one whose importance for my country is well known. I refer to the question of Maldivas islands. As the General assembly is aware my country has restored diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom  thus initiating the process of normalization that is already bearing fruit.This new situation is possible thanks to the political decision of President Menem to come to an agreement with the British government on a formula that protects the sovereign rights of Argentinaover the Malvinas  South Georgia  and South Sandwich islands  which cannot be relinquished. Its implementation enables us to advance in the strengthening of our bilateral relations while we search for ways and means to solve existing differences. The Argentina governmentbelieves that this new climate between the two countries must also facilitate  at the appropriate time  the resumption of negotiations on sovereignty repeatedly called for by the General Assembly.Meanwhile  both countries need to work out special and creative arrangements which  while adequately taking into account the interests of the islanders  will permit cooperation between the Argentine continental territory and the islands. This would allow us to solve the existing lack of contact  which is anachronistic and inconsistent with the current atmosphere of good will in the relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The Argentina government once again expresses its political will to put an end to this situation of isolation and to comply fully with the General Assembly resolutions on the Malvinas Islands.The solution reached in political situations of conflict provides clear  evidence that organization is fulfilling its ideas of peace and co-operation. My government is convinced that the United Nations can help to bring about a peaceful settlement of the international conflicts that still exist. The new international situation will allow the organization to plan a relevant role in the conflicts in the western Sahara and Cambodia. Special mention shouldbe made on the positive efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council in preparing the peace plan for Cambodia. However  we are concerned that  in spite of the countless efforts and the progress achieved towards the peaceful settlement of many regional conflicts  the international community is still in doubt because it has not found a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine. My government  which has joined in the efforts of the international community to find a peaceful and comprehensive solution to this question  considers that the United Nations should not fail to take advantage of the unique opportunity offered by the present international situation  so as to enable the Palestinian people to achieve the recognition and exercise of its legitimate rights through a just and negotiated solution. Co-operation and dialogue must prevail over any other objective  so that all states of the region may be able to live together in peace and harmony. In addition  we believe that in order for Israel to realize that the United nations promoting a just an unbiased solution  it would be advisable to forgo the offending references based on analogies between Zionism and racism that emerge in times of confrontation and contribute little to the search for a constructive dialogue. The process of democratic reform in Latin America will determine the role of that region in the new course of world events. The establishment of newly elected governments in Chile and Nicaragua  and the negotiations between the Government of El Salvador and the rebel forces since the agreements arrived at in Geneva in April  confirms this tread towards democracy   tolerance and political pluralism. At the  same time  we observe more and more often the far-reaching process of economic reform and renewed initiatives for integration on the part of the Latin American countries and of America as a whole  which allow us to hope that the nations of this continent will move in the direction of development  modernization and international security. Argentina gives special relevance to the challenge implied in the commitment assumed with Brazil  to structure a common market to be completed towards the end of 1994.  We are striving to ensure that this initiative  will involved other sister states of Latin America also. In a world that is constantly shrinking  as a result of technological progress  generating an international system that is increasingly interdependent and complex  there is a need for transparent foreign policy actions that will generate trust in relations between states. These relations must adapt to the fundamental changes in the political and economic criteria that prevail in the world. Whereas at the political level we see that there is a irreversible tendency to reaffirm human  rights and pluralism  as against dictatorship and authoritarianism  which are irreparably on the decline  at the economic level we see the reopening of markets as against State interventionism and protectionism. The domestic policy decisions adopted by the Government of my country since mid-1989 coincide with these profound international changes  pursuing as they do the strengthening of freedom and democracy  on the one hand  and the economic reform and the opening up of our economy on the other  all in order to fit politically and economically into the new international reality. In this new context  at the international level there prevails a clear tendency to reform paralysing State structures to allow the demonopolization andderegulation of economic activities and to create a competitive  productive system as an indispensable basis for development. Our Government joins in these trends with the firm resolve to become an integral part of the global economy  in order to put an end to marginality and the dead end of increasing indebtedness without development. This calls for an adjustment of our rules of the game in order to reverse stagnation  making the country a recipient of capital that may act as a dynamic force for our human and natural resources. Two systems were born in the post-war period  systems to which my country has adhered and which should  in its opinion  be strengthened. I refer to the ones born in san Francisco and Bretton Woods  which reinforce each other‘  since peace and security are the basic requirements for stability and economic growth. However  the confrontation between the two super-Powers prevented the two orders from fully working. Today  the generalized accession of the socialist economies to the main international financial institutions and the end of the cold war are opening up a new chapter in the future of international co-operation  making it possible to envision the configuration of one world  increasingly integrated and co-operative. In this context  we look toward an international trading system  free of distortions and barriers  one that may allow all members of the international community to become part of the global economy  according to their potential and possibilities. In this connection  the practice of subsidising the production and export of agricultural products - which is seriously affecting the efficient producer countries - must be avoided. My country is taking part in the ongoing negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  in the belief that on them depends to a great extent the multilateral solution to the expanding current trade conflicts and the future of international economic co-operation. In the economic field also we are facing a conflict between the law of the stronger  with a return to the trade wars of the period between the wars  on the one hand  and  on the other  multilateral agreements that reinforce the Bretton Woods system. In the last few years the increasing need for co-operation between countries and their interdependence in respect of problems that transcend national boundaries and demand broader and more co-ordinated responses -problems such as the environment  human rights and drugs  have become characteristic of the international system and offer a fertile context for international co-operation and thy work of our Organization. Environmental considerations make it necessary to identify models which can be sustained without depleting the resources that feed them. We are fully aware of the need to take  at the national level  every step that will ensure that future generations enjoy the resources we have received. We also know that in many cases national efforts will not be enough in themselves  and we are trying to find  especially at the regional level  a way to implement concerted and effective conservation initiatives. Some serious problems  which have not  in general  been caused by the developing countries   are of a global nature  and we are committed to the common effort to halt deterioration and bring about environmental recovery. The Conference on Environment and Development  whose preparatory work is under way  will be a favourable arena in which to demonstrate the new spirit of co-operation that is needed to solve shared problems. Illicit trafficking in drugs can be affectively controlled only if all members of the international community act in  a concerted fashion toward that end; in this respect  my country has endorsed the political declaration and global plan of action adopted during the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to the question of narcotic drugs. The individual and collective dimensions of human rights are complementary  and come together for the benefit of human beings in such a way that civil and political rights are as important as economic  social and cultural rights. we are convinced that the former are no more  important than the latter - and indeed noless important - and that the exercise of some cannot serve as a pretext for denying the exercise of others. The serious events that have taken place in recent weeks have created a historical emergency  and we must therefore co-operate vigorously to make a world which is safer in its search for peace. On this global scene  our Organisation has a crucial role to play; we already possess the necessary structures for discussion  and all we have to do is adapt the existing executive mechanisms. We must rely on our collective imagination in order to find the fastest and safest way to that end. we are witnessing renewed dynamism in the Security Council  which is undoubtedly the result of a new philosophy of co-operation on the part of the super-powers in respect of regional and international conflicts. It is imperative for the work of the Council to be strengthened in an atmosphere free of mistrust and confrontation. Once again  today the eyes of all the peoples of the world are on this forum  aware and hopeful that the Organisation can contribute towards the creation of a  safer and more just world. This century has seen played out countless wars and conflicts which made us doubt whether the principles of the Charter could be enforced and whether it was possible to leave future generations a world free of the scourge of war  a world in which the fundamental rights of man  the dignity and value of the human person and the equality of rights between men and women and nations great and small would be in force and observed. In the final years of this century  the international community cannot fail to take up the challenge of putting into practice the ideals of the founders of organisation."
"6",279,"ATG",45,1990,"﻿Please accept my country's congratulations  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The people of Antigua and Barbuda feel connected to your country  not merely because we are members of the Commonwealth of Nations but also  and primarily  because Malta is a small  island country much like ours. Malta's role in international affairs serves as a beacon of achievement for small countries. We congratulate you Sir  on your election to this high office and hold great expectations for the success of this session.My delegation welcomes Liechtenstein to the family of nations and wishes to express particular pride in the admission of a small state. Small states need the United Nations; membership for us is neither a luxury nor an afterthought. However  if the events of the past eight weeks have taught a single new lesson  it is that large and powerful States have an equal need for the United Nations. The rule of law  so necessary for the preservation of peace  is of paramount importance if the principle of the sovereign equality of States is to endure. Small States can be assured of the permanence of their sovereignty by being members of the United Nations  the world's parliament and peace-making body. We congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  on the leadership role be has played in securing peace. Permit me also to express my profound respect for your predecessor  Ambassador Garba of Nigeria. His leadership during countless negotiating sessions confirmed the faith placed in him last year and explains the admiration he has won. The people of my small country extend special thanks to former President Garba for the kind words addressed to me in his parting statement.Twenty-five years ago three outstanding Caribbean statesman - Errol Barrow of Barbados  Forbes Burnham of Guyana and Vere C  Bird  my Prise Minister - met at Dickenson Bay  Antigua  to lend their signatures to the charter of what is known today as the Caribbean Community. My small  developing  island country takes pride in knowing that it has served as the bedrock of regional integration in the Caribbean. The Caribbean Community  25 years old this year  now embraces every English-speaking independent country in the Caribbean and three non-independent Caribbean States. Act the regional integration movement in the Caribbean gains momentum  our experience has confirmed the assertions made in 1965 by the founders of the Caribbean Community. They had long argued that seemingly intractable common problems within and community nations are best tackled by the multilateral approach. Out island country will thus continue to promote multilateralism  convinced that it does provide the mechanism for co-operation  continuity and peaceful coexistence. We view the United Nations as the principal stage for the promotion of this common-sense approach to problem solving.It is widely recognised  for example  that the prestige of the United Nations today is higher than it has ever been. My delegation is firmly convinced that the unanimous condemnation of Iraq for its occupation of Kuwait is possible in 1990 because of the multilateral approach adopted in the hour of crisis. If nations large or small  wealthy or poor  are to be persuaded to turn their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks  then multilateralism must become a tenet of the foreign policy of States  and the mechanism of the United Nations must be relied upon as an integral actor. The United Nations must not be made merely a convenient tool to be included in or excluded from tumultuous world events at the whim of States; the legitimacy of the United nations will quickly be eroded if it appears to be the handmaiden of a few.My Government and people join in the universal condemnation of Iraq. As a small State  we feel a bond with the people of Kuwait  we share their sense of loss and outrage  and we wish then to know that my small  developing  island country will do all that it can within these walls and elsewhere to help bring an end to the injustices perpetrated by the invaders.Another injustice  perpetrated by indifference and greed  brews without surcease in the Caribbean country of Haiti. In 1804  when the Haitian revolutionary Toussaiat L'Ouverture succeeded in eradicating slavery from Haiti  he heralded a new world order which  in the three decades following  hastened the end of the evil system of slavery throughout the Caribbean. Haiti became the first independent republic of transplanted Africans in the New World. As we stand on the threshold of another new world order  democracy in Haiti cries out for assistance. The United Nations is being asked to provide a tested method of assistance at the behest of the Government of Haiti. My small Caribbean country  determined to repay its historical debt to Haiti and to lend shape to the emerging new world order  has joined in sponsoring a draft resolution which is sure to be adopted unanimously by this Assembly. A resolution on Haiti does not  however  translate into material assistance; it behoves us to make pledges of financial support for the electoral process in Haiti and to contribute to the eventual rebuilding of an economically viable and politically stable Haiti. If we do not succeed with this initiative  if we fail in this venture  than we shall have failed in our effort to contribute to the creation of a fair and decent world.A fair and decent South Africa eludes us for yet another year. The evil system of apartheid has been shaken by continued universal condensation; the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and the unbanning of the African National Congress and other political groups are the direct result of the counting pressure brought to bear on South Africa by sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Those sanctions cannot be relaxed at this time.My country and people welcome the far-reaching changes taking place in South Africa. We continue to call on the racist regime to move swiftly to dismantle apartheid  conscious of the fact that the longer official racism remains in place the more difficult will be the reconstruction period following its demise.Apartheid must be dismantled now in order to save South Africa's black and white children from suffering the pain and misery inflicted on adults and children alike by an oppressive and unjust system maintained by force.The continued violence against indigenous peoples in the modern world cannot be allowed to continue. A year ago Antigua and Barbuda issued a call for their protection following revelations that more than 200 000 indigenous people had perished by violent means in the preceding twelve-month period. The plight of the world's indigenous peoples since then has improved not at all  Gold-miners  land-grabbers and thoughtless criminals have invaded the lands of indigenous peoples  causing disease  environmental degradation and massive disruption of traditional life. The islands of my Caribbean were once the home of several indigenous peoples that were virtually exterminated by war and slavery  beginning in 1492. Today's indigenous peoples fight  like the heroic Caribbean peoples of centuries past  against more formidable foes  who will surely also drive them into extinction. Antigua and Barbuda will thus readily give its support to the Group for the Study of Indigenous Populations  connected to the United Nations Subcommittee for the Protection of Minorities  in proposing that 1992 should be declared the ""International Tear of the Indigenous Peoples of the World"".Two years after becoming a Member of the United Nations  Antigua and Barbuda joined with Malaysia and several other developing countries to press for the protection of Antarctica. It would not be unreasonable to conclude that we are disappointed with the progress made thus far; yet we hold great expectations for the outcome of the environmental protection conference of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to be held in Chile next month. We assert the right of Secretary-General or his representative to be present  though we acknowledge the greater need for non-Treaty parties to have a meaningful role in the decision-making process. It is our fins belief that Antarctica should be brought under the umbrella of control of the United Nations. The frozen continent must not become the possession of large States only.My country is unshakably pledged to the cause of preserving Antarctica as the common heritage of all mankind. Our contribution to the debate on the rational uses of Antarctica is an extension of our commitment to the preservation of the environment. Threats to the Earth's environment have multiplied a thousand-fold since the start of the industrial revolution  at the turn of this century. In less than 100 years  mankind has succeeded in upsetting the ecological balance which evolved over the 3 000 million-year history of our planet. Within the next 40 years  it is estimated that mankind will burn more fuel than has been consumed since the discovery of fire half a million years ago. Increasing levels of pollution  coupled with a simultaneous decrease in the ability of natural systems to absorb atmospheric wastes  will accelerate environmental decline.Rain forests  the most valuable of mankind's terrestrial assets  are being destroyed at an alarming rate daily. Our oceans are polluted by various contaminants - including fertiliser run-off  industrial wastes and oil spills - while low-lying agricultural lands weld wide  including entire islands in the Caribbean and in the South Pacific  are threatened with submersion by rising sea- levels brought about by global warming and the melting of the polar ice-caps. Ours is an ill planet which will become more ill unless our countries are willing to alter significantly our patterns of consumption.Ironically  the wellspring of this state of affairs can be found in causes stemming from both wealth and poverty. Developed and developing countries both contribute. The solutions therefore  lie in both national and international actions. My country thus welcomes the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development to be hosted by Brazil  and applauds the Maldives for the Conference on Sea-Level Rise held recently.One month ago at the United Nations Congress on Crime  held in Havana  my Government outlined its policies to combat international crime - one of the modern scourges of mankind. And  at the special session on drugs earlier this year  we shared with the Assembly our concerns and the approaches we have adopted to eliminate the danger posed by drug trafficking.At the Congress on Crime and at the special session on drugs  the consensus clearly pointed to a need for а multilateral assault on the purveyors of these evils. My country has thus formulated a regional plan of action in concert with eight other Caribbean island nations to deter regional drug traffickers and to dissuade criminals with grandiose schemes. We have formed a regional security force which is prepared to respond swiftly and forcefully to any threats to its members’ sovereignty.My Government has also given its support to the proposal  put forward by Trinidad and Tobago  to breathe new life into the idea of an international criminal court of justice. We are confident that such an institution would provide a workable mechanism as part of a whole range of services required for the fair administration of international criminal justice.Drug trafficking and criminal terrorism pose special security problems to island countries with hundreds of miles of unguarded shorelines and with scarce resources to match the ultra-modern equipment which wealthy drug barons have the wherewithal to purchase. But beyond security lies another problem. We have learned from other island countries in advanced stages of development  like Singapore  that investment in children and youth is the most certain route away from under-development. Priority in my island country has thus been given to the development of human resources. To neglect our human resource base is to undermine the potential for future economic growth. Yet  scarce financial resources must be diverted .to combat drug traffickers and criminal terrorists  while official development assistance slows to a trickle and borrowing  at lower than the market rate of interest  has become unavailable. My relatively poor island-developing country  with a per capita income barely exceeding $2 000 per annum  has been graduated to a middle-income country  thereby putting concessionary loans beyond our grasp. Small island countries so vulnerable to devastating natural catastrophes  so lacking in natural resources and with exceedingly small populations  cannot reasonably be judged by the same economic yardsticks as populous  resource-endowed  large countries.We therefore call once again for the use of more reliable economic indicators in judging the well-being of small island-developing countries.The economic well-being of an independent Namibia is of great importance to Antigua and Barbuda. We welcome Namibia to this forum as a free  independent Member country. Our small voice was frequently raised in condemnation of South Africa for its unlawful occupation of Namibia  and we have recently matched our words with a financial contribution to the nation-building exercise. Political independence can become meaningless if economic conditions remain poor and Namibia remains dependent on South African goodwill.Continuing on the African continent  we wish the people of Western Sahara also to know that they can count on our continued support in their struggle for self- determination. My country welcomes the approval by the Security Council of the Secretary-General plan to supervise a cease-fire between Morocco and the POLISARIO  and to organise and conduct a referendum.Antigua and Barbuda is equally pleased by the decision of the Cambodian parties to accept an enhanced role for the United Nations and to form a Supreme National Council to facilitate negotiations.There has been no progress in Cyprus and the situation in Lebanon appears to be at a stalemate. We must redouble our efforts here at the United Nations to bring these tortuous civil wars to an end. He will also continue to seek a just solution to the Palestinian problem.In Central America we welcome the triumph of peace and rejoice with the Nicaraguan and Panamanian peoples. We adhere to our earlier pronouncements that economic injustice is the root cause of many of the conflicts in that region. They were exacerbated by cold-war tensions  which  thankfully  have disappeared. Until economic reforms are instituted  Central America will continue to experience civil strife. We have also witnessed a lessening of tensions in Europe. On 3 October 1990  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  previously separated by a hideous man-made wall  peacefully reunited and became the nation of Germany. This remarkable change is perhaps the most encouraging indicator that East-West cold war tensions are disappearing. The destruction of the Berlin Wall demonstrates the irreversible changes taking place on the Eastern half of the European continent. On behalf of the Government and the people of Antigua and Barbuda  my delegation welcomes the new Germany to the United Nations  and extends heartfelt best wishes to its Government and its people.The lessening of tensions can also be witnessed on the Korean peninsula. It is our hope that the Koreans  like the Germans and the Yemenis  will join hands one day soon. Until that day  my country supports the Republic of Korea in its request for membership in the Organisation. We consider unjust the continued denial of membership for reasons other than those stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.As mankind approaches the final decade of the twentieth century  it is faced with the task of fashioning what is increasingly being called a new world order. It is our function at the United Nations to give structure to current events so that the world of the twenty-first century may be better organised. Our task is to meet the needs of the human family while minimising environmental degradation  eliminating brutal dictatorship  ending apartheid and senseless discrimination against women  and dispensing an acceptable standard of health  housing and education to the world's poor and powerless.A country as small as my own will not pretend to have a measurable impact upon any emerging new world order but it would be dangerously presumptuous for large nations to assume that there is nothing to be learned from small countries. It was the Haitian revolution which hastened the destruction of slavery and paved the way for the introduction of a new economic system in the Western hemisphere at the dawn of the nineteenth century. It is Liechtenstein  the smallest State Member of the United Nations  which enjoys the highest per capita income of any country in the world. It was Marcus Garvey of Jamaica who fired the minds of African and Caribbean leaders in the struggle to eliminate colonialism in the twentieth century. It was Sir Arthur Lewis of Saint Lucia whose writings on development economics and whose practical suggestions for economic development plans earned him the Nobel Prize for economics 12 years ago.Antigua and Barbuda can be counted on to live up to its responsibility to its people  to its region and to the world at large. Whatever the forum  be it the cabinet  the Caribbean Community or the community of nations  my country will courageously promote those ideas that constitute the corner-stone of a new world order.""Small size""  my Prime Minister has frequently said  ""does not mean small minds or the absence of grand ideas."" And the grandest ideas are peace and justice."
"7",326,"AUS",45,1990,"﻿It is with great pleasure. Sir  that I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  a role for which your extensive experience in international relations  your legal training and your interest in human rights qualify you highly. The excellent relationship between Australia and Malta is of long standing  based on extensive family and community ties as well as on our strong and active membership of the Commonwealth  and we do look forward to working very closely with you. I would also like to join others in extending warm welcome to Namibia and Liechtenstein  the newest Members of the United Nations.We meet today in the General Assembly on the eve of the recreation of a united Germany  an event which marks  as no other could do so clearly  the end of the post-war era. It is an era which has been dominated by the cold war and nuclear confrontation  but which has also seen extraordinary change: the end of the European colonial empires and the re-emergence of the independent nations of Africa and Asia) the economic reconstruction and ever closer political association of Western Europe; and  starting with the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  and the specialised agencies of the United Nations  the growth of multilateralism on a remarkable and unprecedented scale.However  the poet-war era has left for us many problems that still remain to be solved. Iraq's aggression in the Gulf has shown that the habits of millennia are not going to change overnight  and that the arrogance of military power remains a scourge with which the world will still have to deal. The scourges of hunger  ill-health  poverty and debt also remain to an intolerable extent  threatening to widen rather than narrow the already alarming gulf between North and South. The scourge of racism  and ethnic and religious hatred  still remains to be purged from many countries and regions. And there is another scourge - the impact of human activity upon the sustaining environment o£ our planet itself - a scourge whose magnitude we are only now beginning to recognise.The challenge for us all in the new era ahead of us  as relationships  policies and attitudes that had been frozen for so long continue to unfreeze  as the cold war becomes the great thaw  is for us to confront and overcome these scourges once and for all. If that is to happen  we will need  above all else  to develop habits of mind which are co-operative rather than confrontational  and habits of action which are instinctively multilateral. Whether the challenge goes to the physical security of nations  the economic health of their peoples  the environmental integrity of the planet itself  or any other problem that no nation can solve wholly by itself. we have to derive inspiration from the thought that we are one world and can each survive only if we can all act collectively.There is nothing inevitable about the development of any such approach. although events of recent weeks and mouths can certainly give us heart. The trends that will shape the new era are our own to make. Indeed. it is the actions over the next few years of the very men and women who have been assembled in this building over the last week that will launch that era for good or for ill. The world has been given a second chance. and this time we must not again take a false turn.How we shape the security system of the new era is being comprehensively tested at its outset by the present Gulf crisis. If unity holds in this instance  if the community of nations  acting together under the authority of the United Nations Charter and with the full support of the Security Council  succeeds in demonstrating beyond doubt that aggression does not pay and cannot succeed  then that demonstration effect will weigh heavily on those nations  particularly those with great comparative regional power  which might in the future be tempted to settle disagreements by intimidation and force. If our resolve weakens  the demonstration effect will be equally convincing in its message that the international community is powerless to enforce decisions that we all recognise to be just. Such an outcome is unthinkable.The crisis in the Gulf can be only resolved on the basis of the conditions set by the United Nations Security Council resolutions being fully and unequivocally met. That is by Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait  the restoration of the legitimate Kuwaiti Government  and the release of all foreign nationals who want to leave. It is Australia's hope that those objectives can be met through the rigorous application of sanctions pursuant to Security Council resolutions 661 (1990)  665 (1990) and 670 (1990). Military-strike action cannot and should not be wholly ruled out at the end of the day should all other means of resolving the crisis fail  but Australia shares the universal hope that sanity will prevail and that a peace without appeasement will be achieved without the horrors of war having to be contemplated.We can draw both encouragement and hope for the future from tin unprecedented level of international co-operation to meet the crisis  co-operation that has enabled the Security Council to respond promptly and effectively and has restored the Council to its proper central place in international security. The greater willingness of the five permanent members of the Security Council to work together has not only held the line in the Gulf crisis  but has been a crucial factor in what we now hope is the imminent resolution of the Cambodian problem - a problem that not only has involved many years of tragedy for the Cambodian people  but has been a severe ongoing challenge to the security of the South-East Asia region.A detailed framework for a comprehensive Cambodian settlement has been drafted and agreed by the Permanent Five over the course of this year  and has now been accepted in its entirety by a meeting of the Cambodian parties convened by the Paris Conference co-Chairmen in Jakarta last month. That framework document - baaed in significant part  we are gratified to note  on ideas developed by Australia for an enhanced United Motions role - involves two central components first  the creation of a fully representative Supreme National Council to embody the sovereignty of the Cambodian nation; and  secondly  a role for the United Nations that extends not only to traditional peace-keeping activity and an increasingly common electoral organisation  but also to responsibility for key elements of civil administration in the transitional period pending free and fair elections. The Supreme National Council has been formally established. It will occupy the Cambodian seat in the United Nations  and the process of putting in place a final comprehensive settlement  endorsed by a reconvened Paris Conference  is well under way. A number of matters  procedural and substantive  do remain to be negotiated  and there is bound to be some faltering before the process is complete  but the commitment of relevant countries and parties to finally achieving peace is now such that it is possible  after years of frustration and disappointment  to be much more optimistic than ever before that a durable peace will shortly be achieved.For some other long-running regional conflicts the outlook is much less  bright. Pre-eminent among them is the Palestinian issue  which  whatever the outcome of the Gulf crisis  will simply not go away until it is resolved in a manner that meets the basic needs and aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis. Australia has consistently expressed support for a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli dispute on the Palestinian issue on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We assert Israel's right to live within secure and recognized borders  but we also acknowledge that of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including its right to an independent State if it so chooses. We regard the proposals for the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as a step towards the achievement of a peaceful settlement  and encourage all the involved parties to pursue that dialogue with real and sustained commitment.One aspect of the issue that continues to hinder the peace process is General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX) of 1975 equating Zionism with racism. Australia remains strongly opposed to that resolution  which only exacerbates the differences between the parties. We hope that  with the revitalisation of its role and responsibilities in promoting international co-operation  the United Nations will rescind the resolution. Another Middle East issue of continuing concern  as we heard earlier this afternoon  is the situation in Lebanon  a country torn apart by conflict for 15 years now. The Taif Agreement  concluded in October last year by the Lebanese themselves with the support of the Arab League  represented a welcome breakthrough. The international community should stand ready to assist Lebanon in achieving peace  but the essential requirement is that there be a commitment from all the parties in Lebanon to national reconciliation  and a willingness to compromise to arrive at a negotiated solution. If anything has become clear over the last 15 years  it is that a lasting solution cannot be imposed by force.The continuing troubles in Cyprus are another instance of entrenched attitudes making reconciliation extremely difficult. The failure of the attempt to revive the inter-communal talks in February was particularly disappointing. Prospects for progress will remain bleak unless there is a real determination to succeed on both sides and a willingness to enter into negotiations free of pre-conditions. Australia continues to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to promote a negotiated solution  in the belief that that is the route by which a just settlement is most likely to be reached.That just settlements of apparently intractable problems can be reached with the help of the international community is amply demonstrated by recent events in southern Africa. In Namibia the United Nations mounted one of the most complex peace-keeping operations in its history and played a vital role in guaranteeing the impartiality of the elections and of the transition process. And in South Africa itself the Government has over the past few months at last begun to take steps towards negotiations with the representatives of the majority of South Africans and towards dismantling the repressive and brutal system of apartheid. The Australian Government warmly welcomes the statesmanship shown to date by President De Klerk  but urges the South African Government to move as soon as possible into substantive constitutional negotiations and to remove the remaining legislative cornerstones of the apartheid system. More does need to be done before those who have suffered under apartheid and those who support their struggle can be confident that developments in South Africa do constitute profound and irreversible change. We believe that sanctions imposed by the international community have played a central role in bringing about the important changes now under way  and that the sanctions pressure should not yet be reduced or lifted. But we hope the time will rapidly come when it can be. For Australia  the South Pacific is also an area of vital interest  and we continue to encourage processes of political development in the region. We are gratified in this respect by the continuing success of the Matignon and Oudinot Accords in creating a constructive and peaceful environment in New Caledonia for the working out of that country's political future. Equally  however  we continue to be deeply disappointed at the backward steps that occurred in Fiji with the events of 1987 and the recent promulgation of a Constitution which  while marking a welcome return to representative constitutional Government  none the less in the process builds new and far-reaching racially discriminatory principles into the Fijian political system.Two countries in the Pacific which have been frustrated in fully developing a political identity of their own are the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands  and Australia believes the United Nations has a constructive role to play in this respect. The full fruits of self-government which should have followed their legitimate acts of self-determination have been denied to then by legalistic approaches to the question of their political status. The continued application of the trusteeship regime to them not only belittles what they have already achieved in establishing independent political identities  but imposes practical disadvantages on them in their pursuit of national development.If the coming era is to learn from the mistakes of the past  we need not only to find new co-operative ways of resolving regional problems - whether these be potentially global or much more limited in their consequences - but also to tackle with determination and stamina the most alarming global security problems of the cold war era - the upward spiral of arms procurement and the proliferation of increasingly more destructive weapons. That task is all the more important in our increasingly multipolar world. While the progress made by the United States and the Soviet Union in their bilateral negotiations is evidence of super-Power commitment to a more peaceful world  it should also now be complemented by progress in multilateral disarmament negotiations We in Australia are proud of our commitment to the process of disarmament and intend to redouble our efforts to capitalise on the current circumstances to achieve specific disarmament goals in the multilateral context  particularly in relation to chemical and nuclear weapons. Significant progress on the achievement of a chemical weapons convention has been made in the last year  but the need to conclude this convention is now greater than ever  and the opportunity to do so must be seized. Australia believes that a decisive step towards this goal would be a ministerial-level meeting of the Conference on Disarmament to be held as soon as possible.We also continue to work assiduously to eliminate nuclear weapons. Australia is proud of its part  together with the other members of the South Pacific Forum  in the creation of the Treaty of Rarotonga  which has established a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. We will not rest until a comprehensive test-ban treaty has been achieved with appropriate verification procedures. To help move towards that goal  Australia will be once more proposing  with New Zealand and other sponsors  a draft resolution on a comprehensive test ban this year and looks forward again to achieving strong support for it. We would wish this support to be carried over to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  which is the appropriate forum for a comprehensive test ban to be negotiated. We are  therefore  pleased that the Conference on Disarmament has this year re-established an Ad Hoc Committee on a nuclear-test ban  which will provide the opportunity for important preparatory work to a comprehensive test-ban treaty to be undertaken. Australia was an active participant in Geneva at the recent Review Conference of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. Despite the Conference's regrettable inability to adopt a final declaration  we none the loss consider it to have been a considerable success. Reaching agreement  as it did  on a number of important issues  in particular the question of full-scope safeguards as a condition for nuclear supply. We will be working to build on the achievements of the Conference and to set the scene for a successful review and extension of the Treaty in 193S. The non-proliferation Treaty is an absolutely essential foundation on which the new relationships of the coming era must be built.The acquisition of conventional weapons continues at an alarming rate in many parts of the globe. Often scarce resources are diverted from social and economic development to military expenditure. Australia supports measures by all State· to reduce military budgets and to implement confidence-building measures which will reduce the risk of conflict.The world community  while it is working together for a future of common security  has a second chance to show its equal determination to create a future of common prosperity. Meeting economic challenges is no less important than meeting security challenges if we are to provide guaranteed life and health for our children  and a fulfilling life for all our citizens.Australia supports the efforts made by the United Nations in mobilising international support for development efforts. The eighteenth special session of the General Assembly in April highlighted a new sense of commitment and renewed optimism for global economic co-operation. The globalization of economic problems has been accompanied by a growing awareness that their resolution can be achieved only by a sustained international partnership. Australia is particularly concerned at the human cost of heavy national indebtedness  which severely compromises development efforts in many countries. Debtors and creditors need to address the issues raised by that indebtedness again in a spirit of international economic co-operation and in a way that addresses not only the immediate but in addition the long-term problems of the nation in question. Debt-reduction packages should be implemented in such a way as to enhance credit-worthiness and new money flows  and to support reform progress in heavily indebted countries.Australia firmly believes that  whatever may be the contribution of debt reduction and development co-operation programmes  the expansion of global trade is central to economic growth and development.The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is fundamentally about creating a more secure  stable and open international economic environment. GATT provides a framework of rights and obligations within which economic ambition can be channelled to the benefit of all countries  and not just the few most powerful. That is why the success of the Uruguay Round is so important. Between now and the final ministerial meeting in Brussels in December  all participants in the negotiations will have to intensify their efforts  and develop more of a spirit of compromise than has so far been evident  if a successful outcome is to be achieved. Nobody should be in any doubt that failure of the Uruguay Round would be disastrous for the world trading economy  for all the developing nations dependent on selling their commodities in the international marketplace and  indeed  for all the people we represent.In addition to the abiding issues of security and economic development  there is a ""third agenda"" of problems now being given much increased prominence in international relations - problem that are either too big for each country to solve individually or which are of a character that global action or global pressure can very much help to solve. In areas such as threats to the global environment  health problems like AXDS  the illicit narcotics trade and the problem of refugees and displaced persons  global interdependence is an omnipresent reality  and Multilateral diplomacy an indispensable necessity. The era which we are entering is Marked by the Multiplication of such problems  and the quality of life of the people we represent will be very Much determined by our ability to solve them.The global environment is certainly one of the key international issues of the 1990s. We are working towards the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which should deal with these two issues in an integrated way. The Conference will not succeed  however  unless considerably more effort is put into reconciling the conflicts between environmental and economic development policies. The two are not inconsistent: the goal of sustainable development can be achieved. But if the United Nations is to lead international efforts in this sphere  we must stop discussing the processes and start debating the substance. For the United Nations to make the most constructive input into solving these problems  there has to be greater co-ordination between the United Nations environment agencies  such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNKP) and United Nations development agencies  such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). There is no obvious need for more agencies and institutions to deal with these issues; we do used to strengthen our existing institutions and to improve communication and co-ordination between them. Australia is a strong supporter of the Antarctic Treaty System which reflects the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and has brought peace. stability and remarkable international co-operation to a very special region of the globe. Moves are sow under way  with strong support from Australia  for the establishment within the Antarctic Treaty System of a far-sighted comprehensive environmental protection regime. One aspect of which would  it is hoped  be a permanent ban on mining and oil drilling within the region  to guarantee once and for all the permanence of its uniquely fragile and irreplaceable environment. I would urge those countries not currently involved in these discussions but interested in promoting environmental protection in Antarctica to join the Antarctic Treaty  for it is only through that framework that an effective regime can and will be put in place.Two other issues directly and immediately affecting the lives of individual citizens also particularly require concerted international action. The 1990s have been declared the Decade against Drug Abuse. Australia will continue to strive - in multilateral forums  with bilateral assistance  and by domestic action - to reverse the growth of this menace. In the global struggle against the AIDS pandemic Australia has supported the central co-ordinating role of the World Health Organisation and is providing financial assistance to its Global Plan AIDS for the development of national AIDS programmes  particularly in South-East Asia. and the Pacific and Indian Ocean island countries.Human rights issues generally remain very much part of the new international agenda. The most important factor in establishing human rights in this new era will be the spread of democracy to those parts of the world where democratic and freedom are still unknown. The growth of democracy in Eastern Europe has already seen an encouraging reduction in East-West confrontation in the human rights arena. We have welcomed  in particular  a new spirit of co-operation that has become evident in the Commission on Human Rights.  Unfortunately  the record in human rights in all too many parts of the world has not been all positive over the past year. Australia is appalled at the treatment of innocent civilians caught up in the Gulf crisis and condemns in the strongest terms restrictions imposed by the Government of Iraq on the freedom of movement of hostages held in that country and in Kuwait. Closer to home  Australia is also concerned with continuing restrictions  on democratic and individual freedom  in both China and Myanmar  and we appeal to all involved in the situation in Sri Lanka to end the cycle of violence which is destroying the fabric of country in that nation. We frankly acknowledge that Australia’s own past is not without blemish in regard to human rights  in particular concerning the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However  we have progressed along the path of rectifying those injustices. We welcome international scrutiny of our efforts and are prepared to engage in dialogue with any interested country at any time on such issues. We take the view that the question of conformity to international human rights standards is not each country's own internal business  but the world’s business.I said at the outset that  as we move beyond the post-war era  the world has been given a second chance. This body  the United Nations  has also been given a second chance  and we  its Members  have to ensure that it is capable of grasping this opportunity. In many ways  the founders of the United Nations were far-sighted and built structures that will now stand us in good stead. In other respects  it is clear that they could not have foreseen the circumstance of this new era and we should not shy away from change  from discarding of long-established conventions and procedures and from the creation of new structures and new ways of doing things which better suit the new times. Our guiding criterion should be that we wish the United Nations to be effective and to influence events  rather than to be passively shaped and overwhelmed by them.One area in which demands on the United Nations are obviously likely to grow in the new era is in the performance of conflict resolution and peace-keeping functions. Indeed  already over the past two years  five peace-keeping operations have been established and several others foreshadowed  including  of course  the comprehensive efforts that will be required in Cambodia. The peace-keeping function is still hampered by political  legal  financial and administrative  problems. Australia advocates the need for greater efficiency and economy in peace-keeping and for the whole peace-keeping area of United Nations activity to be put on a firmer financial end administrative footing. I welcome the steps the Secretary-General has recently taken to improve co-ordination and financing of peace-keeping but note that much more still needs to be done.There is an urgent need to improve the ability of the United Nations  not only to service the demands of its members in regard to peace-keeping and peace-making  but also to deal with the major new issues of global interdependence  of which I spoke earlier. These major issues must be taken up more substantively and effectively than they are currently in the way different intergovernmental forms of the United Nations’ economic and social sector  and this sector needs to be drastically restructured if we are to see the same revival in the economic aspects of the United Nation’s role that we have seen on political issues. Equally there must be better central co-ordination and clearer common purpose among the various agencies and bodies of the United Nations  if each is to play its proper role in attacking Multisectoral problems that can be resolved only if they act together.As far as the Organisation as a whole is concerned  universal Membership should remain our central principle. In this connection  Australia regards as a relic of the past era the continued absence of the two Koreas from the ranks of United Illations Membership. The Republic of Korea has stated its desire to become a full Member and we support admission of both Korean States either simultaneously or separately.The resolutions of this organ of the United Nations  the General Assembly  embody the views of the broad membership of the Organisation. We need to make better use of these annual sessions of our general membership. Let us not be reluctant to remove from our agenda many items that are there by custom  and get rid of many time-wasting  if time-honoured  procedures. Let us use this Assembly to set the norms and standards of correct international behaviour in this new era.The Security Council is showing us how well it can work. At the same time  we have to acknowledge that the world has changed since 194S and that there will be increasing and legitimate pressure to ensure that the membership of the Council better accords with today's realities. In any consideration of restructuring  our principal concern must be for the effectiveness of the Council and we need to be certain that what we do enhances  and does not risk undermining  the efficiency with which the Security Council is currently able to undertake its central role in international peace and security.The Secretariat  which itself has in the past been the victim of cold war pressure  requires re-examination to ensure that its structures end its methods of recruiting its top people  both men and women  are best suited to the need· of the Organisation in the new era  when the demands upon them will grow ever more immense.Two years ago  when I first addressed the United Nations as Foreign Minister of Australia  I drew inspiration from the Charter and from the important role my great Australian Labour predecessor  Mr. Herbert Vere Evatt  played in the founding of the United Nations. I continue to carry in my mind his vision as to what this institution he helped create should achieve - peace  justice and decent standards of living for all the peoples of the world.The nations of the world are now entering a new era of co-operation; we are breaking new ground as we at last accept in full our international responsibility to Met aggression and to resolve regional disputes. And in doing this we have recommitted ourselves and our countries to pursue peace and to end human suffering - not in an ad hoc  almost accidental manner  but as part of a growing international determination that we can make no excuses to our constituents  or to our children  if these goals of peace and development cannot be achieved. This Organisation at last holds out to its members the promise its founders envisaged. But that promise will not be self-fulfilling. There is a historic obligation on us  the Members of the United Nations  to take up at this time and build on the new spirit of international co-operation  to bend our efforts to bolster the new multilateral framework for global peace and security  to act vigorously on the economic challenges before us  and to tackle co-operatively all the social  environmental and health issues which demand global remedies. We have another opportunity to put it right and this time that opportunity must not be lost."
"8",373,"AUT",45,1990,"﻿I am pleased  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am certain that under your able leadership the Assembly will be most efficient in its important deliberations. The Republic of Malta has shown the international community that a small country can make an effective contribution to international co-operation.I wish also to convey my sincere appreciation to your predecessor.Ambassador Joseph Garba  former Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations. We led our deliberations skilfully during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.Let me pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  whose devotion and outstanding service have made a significant contribution to the new esteem the United Nations enjoys and to the growing role of multilateral diplomacy. These advances are particularly important in the light of the regional crises and world-wide challenges we face today.We take great pleasure in welcoming Namibia for the first time to a regular session of the General Assembly. We also a warmly welcome to the Assembly the Principality of Liechtenstein  with which Austria has bonds of deep and intense friendship deriving from the fact that we are neighbours  that we are both neutral countries  and that we share a common history.The past year has been marked by significant progress in the reduction of international antagonisms  the development of new forms of co-operation and the strengthening of international peace at the regional and the world levels. These developments have been particularly spectacular in Europe  but peace efforts have finally borne fruit  after long and often painful years  in some other regions as well. But the new conflict in the Middle East reminds us again that it is illusory to believe in the advent of everlasting peace.In Europe  we honour all those whose courage has made dreams come true. I want to pay a tribute to the many silent heroes of change: to the suffering of all those who have been arrested  beaten  persecuted or exiled; to the writers of underground literature – admiration to the believers; to the intellectuals; to the farmers; to the workers. They are a source of inspiration and optimism for us all. Their steadfast perseverance has brought about a new awareness of the dignity of the human race and the inalienable value of human rights.Only one year has passed since I stood with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary and symbolically cut the barbed war along our common border. For decades that barbed war had symbolised the division of Europe. That era is coming to a close; the gradual unification of the continent of Europe based on a lasting system of security and co-operation is under way.For the first time in this century  European peoples are rallying round common values of human rights  pluralist: democracy  the rule of law  a market economy with a social and ecological dimension. Those are the foundations on which the new Europe is being built. The forthcoming Paris summit of Heads of State or government of states participant in the conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will mark the end of the post-war era and will set in place important guideline for a future European ""architecture""  encompassing pan-European structures and institutions.Next week's New York meeting of CSCE Foreign Ministers will assess the scope of the preparatory work being carried out in Vienna and will take note of the treaty on a final settlement concerning Germany  which governs the external aspects of Gorman unity.Austria  located in the centre of Europe  has been participating actively in the various processes shaping new focus of regional and subregional co-operation. We are convinced that neutral Austria  having applied for membership of the European Community and thanks to its historical experience and its relations with neighbours in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe  can make a special contribution to the building of a new Europe.An example of the new dynamism of subregional international co-operation is the Initiative of the Pentagonal  which comprises Czechoslovakia  Hungary  Italy  Yugoslavia and Austria. This Initiative provides for technical co-operation in areas such as the environment  energy  transport  science and technology  culture and tourism. Such co-operation  which is developing so naturally  proves that even after four decades of separation  centuries-old abilities to communicate remain. The Pentagonal Initiative has also provided a platform for the exchange of views among those five countries and for the definition of common positions on regional issues. Enriched in their culture by more than 25 different nationalities and national minorities. The Pentagonal countries took an important common initiative on the protection of national minorities at the Copenhagen Meeting on the Hunan Dimension of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In it the participating States agreed to adopt  where necessary  special measures for safeguarding the rights of minorities without discrimination and in full equality before the law. The identity of these minorities is to be safeguarded and preserved.Austria is therefore particularly pleased to mention  in this contest  the substantial progress achieved in the implementation of the Austro-Italian Agreement on South Tyrol of 6 September 1946.As I have already been able to report  during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  relations between Italy and Austria have reached an excellent level. However  in order that Austria may declare this conflict - which has been before the United Nations for 30 years - settled  three of the 137 measures agreed upon with Italy in 1969 have yet to be implemented  and a further six questions which arose at a later date and which concern the consensual practice and effectiveness of the Agreement of 6 September 1946 still remain to be resolved.This statement of figures requires some remarks on the quality of the actual situation. Italy has shown increasing understanding for the concerns of the South Tyrolean people. This can be seen both in the implementation of the first part of those measures aimed at establishing equal standing for the Italian and German languages and in the considerable financial allocations for autonomy. Even more significant  however  is the confidence that Italy places in the South Tyrolean minority in general and in its frontier-straddling activities in particular. Italy has thus made it possible for the South Tyroleans to exercise faithfully the noblest task that could be assigned to that minority  that of serving as a cultural  social and economic bridge between Italy and Austria.This positive attitude on the part of the Italian Government shows once more that minorities must be considered a dynamic and enriching element  not a burden. This is an opportunity  both to settle the conflict concerning South Tyrol and to arrest such developments as we nay observe in Eastern European countries today  where old nationality conflicts threaten to reappear once ideological coercion has collapsed.Italy's settling in the near future of the last outstanding questions mentioned not only would resolve a long conflict within the framework of the United Nations but could also provide a positive example to other States with similar problems through the specific provisions agreed to and  even more so  through the experience gained.We must admit that there is a risk that our joy over the tumbling of economic and political wells in Europe may distract our attention from other regional affairs and from the growing complex web of mutual interdependence that today characterises our multipolar world. European unification has  however  never been seen as a substitute for global partnership. On the contrary  peace  stability and co-operation in any region are the prerequisites for tackling those global issues which will inevitably be on the long-term agenda of the community of nations.Iraq's aggression and illegal annexation of the sovereign State of Kuwait provide a formidable challenge to the new global partnership that is emerging after the end of the East-Heat cleavage. The way the entire world has been reacting to this action proves that the overcoming of East-West antagonisms has not only benefited Europe but strengthened a far-reaching sense of solidarity. As far as Austria is concerned  this crisis has clearly shown that the status of permanent neutrality does not prevent us from participating in actions of international solidarity.Since the beginning of the crisis Austria has taken a firm stand  guided also by our own bitter historical memories. We have denounced the illegal occupation and annexation of Kuwait  a sovereign and independent country with which Austria maintains friendly relations.We have condemned the unlawful measures taken by Iraq against foreign citizens and diplomats  and we have fully supported all the sanctions against Iraq as decided upon by the Security Council in resolution 661 (1990). Furthermore  in the spirit of solidarity  neutral Austria has granted over-flight rights over its territory for aircraft carrying reinforcements and food supplies to the troops stationed in Saudi Arabia. In the same spirit of solidarity  we immediately released funds for the benefit of those countries most severely affected economically by the crisis  that is to say  Egypt and Jordan  funds we are determined to increase substantially. Austria also condemns every violation of the privileges and immunities of diplomatic liaisons and representatives as an aggression against the essential foundations of peaceful relations between States. That is why Austria  together with other concerned countries  called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council on the subject.Compliance with the embargo enacted by the Security Council in the relevant resolutions will be an important test of how truly united the nations of the world Organisation are in defiance of law and of the sovereignty and independence of its medium-sized and smaller Members. Austria welcomes the decisions taken by the Security Council in favour of Kuwait because they confirm the principle that small and medium-sized States have the same right to independence as larger countries. It is primarily those countries that are not major Powers that have a vital interest in full compliance with international law  which is so often trampled underfoot. Should Austria  which has submitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period 1991 to 1992  be elected  it will commit itself even more to the realisation of that principle.We may be witnessing a qualitative change is international relations that entails the political relaxation of the noble concept that lies at the heart of the United Nations Charter  namely  collective security for all. This evolution  provided it persists  will most certainly have profound repercussions on concepts of sovereignty  independence and even neutrality. Although we stand ready  together with other States  to draw the necessary conclusions  we are at the same time determined to maintain the predictability and credibility of our policy of neutrality.Only full implementation by Iraq of Security Council resolution 660 (1990) will lead to a peaceful settlement of that conflict. Austria therefore appeals again to Iraq to withdraw its forces immediately and unconditionally from Kuwait  to restore the legitimate authority  sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait and to release all foreign citizens.In view of the highly explosive situation  which could easily lead to enormous bloodshed  we urge all States to explore all possibilities for a peaceful solution of this crisis. I should like to pledge Austria's support for the efforts initiated by the Secretary-General to reach a negotiated settlement with Iraq. There can be no doubt that the action taken by the Security Council has strengthened the authority of the United Nations and its organs  for the first time in its history the Security Council not only has adopted decisions but has also authorised enforcement measures for their implementation. At the sane tine  this determination to take action  far more manifest than in the past  also increases the significance of other Council resolutions  even when not accompanied by such enforcement measures.Of course  as the President of France stressed before the Assembly a few days ago  law is indivisible. As we continue to strengthen the authority of the world Organisation and its resolutions with respect to the Gulf crisis - and here  as the President of the United States has pointed out  no other problem should be allowed to deter us - we must at the sane tine display our determination with regard to the implementation of other resolutions adopted by the Council. We accordingly support the proposal made by  inter alia  the President of the French Republic and the Foreign Minister of the USSS regarding the convening at an appropriate tine of an international conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations.The international efforts to find a peaceful political solution to the Cambodian problem have intensified since the last session of the General Assembly. The new co-operation between the five permanent members of the Security Council has yielded positive results in Cambodia as well. The document on a United Nations-monitored peace plan that was recently adopted signals that there is realistic hope of ending the civil war and thereby the long-lasting suffering of the Cambodian people and of establishing a truly legitimate and democratically elected Government. I hope that the Supreme National Council will facilitate the peace process and national reconciliation. As President of the International Conference on Kampuchea I am at the disposal of all the concerned parties to contribute to that process.Unfortunately  hostilities in Afghanistan are continuing  although the differences on the principles of a political settlement have narrowed. We strongly support the endeavours of the Secretary-General to initiate a peaceful solution to that conflict. We hope that the aid programme carried out within the framework of ""Operation Salaam"" will be of benefit to all areas of the country as a supplement to those peace-making efforts.History will show that the successful completion of the independence process in Namibia has been one of the most positive chapters in the annals of the United Nations. It will doubtless have an impact on the political options perceived by the people of South Africa in moving towards the abolition of apartheid. As a matter of fact the South African Government baa started in 1990 dismantling a major part of apartheid. It has finally realised several opposition leaders  in particular Mr. Nelson Mandela  and has entered into a dialogue with representatives of the black majority. We strongly hope that that Government will take the necessary steps as soon as possible to create the required conditions for genuine negotiations leading to a new  democratic Constitution based on the principle of political pluralism. We welcome the new consensus in South Africa to renounce violence  and to give a chance to negotiations. The international community can only support these developments. The successful United Nations operation in Nicaragua augurs well for the broader issue of peace in Central America. Co-operation between the countries of the region concerned and the support given by the entire international community have proved to be effective elements in the resolution of conflicts. I welcome Nicaragua’s return to democracy and hope that the internal peace and well-being of the Nicaraguan people will thereby be assured.Austria notes with satisfaction the fact that several regional conflicts appear to be moving towards solution. We have tried to contribute to this trend. Austrian battalions are participating in the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Cyprus and on the Golan Heights  and Austrian officers are among the United Nations military observers in Pakistan  in the Middle East  in Iran and in Iraq. The United Nations police force in Namibia has included Austrians  and Austrians have served as election observers in Nicaragua. These activities reflect our firm commitment to the cause of this international Organization and its sustained efforts for peace.The progress that has been made in the resolution of regional conflicts in Asia  Africa and Latin America  and in regard to co-operation and integration in Europe  will release resources and  we hope  focus attention on the ever-more-pressing global issues of human survival that must be addressed. In this contest  we entirely support the endeavours of the Soviet Union and of the United States to reduce their nuclear-weapon arsenals  and hope that all categories of nuclear weapons will be dealt with in the near future.As regards conventional disarmament  considerable progress has been made in the talks on conventional forces in Europe. We hope that soon an initial agreement will be signed at the summit meeting of the CSCE countries  which would open the way to negotiations on further  more far-reaching disarmament measures. The international community looks forward to finalisation  in the course of nest year  of a treaty on chemical weapons. Let see recall  in this respect  that Austria has submitted its candidacy to be the host country for the future organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons.The economic imbalances between industrialised countries and developing countries have been only partly reduced over the years  despite the growing disparity in standards of living in many cases. As certain United Nations reports have underscored  the ""lost 1980e"" have tended to worsen the situation for developing countries and for those sectors of developing societies that have not been able to free themselves from the vicious circle of poverty  underdevelopment  indebtedness  environmental destruction and pressing population growth.Although  in some countries  the debt problem has been alleviated to a certain extent  for many - in particular the least developed countries - it is still a major obstacle to their regaining development momentum. I hope that the principles recently adopted in the final document of the Paris Conference on the least-Developed Countries will give impetus to the search for solutions to the serious problems of those countries.The strengthening of private initiative and entrepreneurial skills offers hope for a return by some countries to sustained development. Structural adjustment and the adjustment of economic policies have been necessary in many cases. However  the social cost of these policies must be kept within certain limits.Let us take note of the fact that the developing countries have themselves played an active role in this process of reorientation. The African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery and the Final Act of UNCTAD VII reflect the changes in perception of  and the criteria used by  the leaders of these countries. The unleashing of internal market forces presupposes favourable external relations. To this end  new financial resources and the opening up of the markets of the industrialised countries are as necessary as the creation of regional markets by means of regional integration. The success of the current GATT negotiations will have a positive influence on external conditions in that it will make them conducive to more dynamic development.""The State of the World Environment"" - a report of the United Nations Environment Programme - provides shocking reading about the staggering tragedy of a resource base that is dwindling owing to deforestation  soil erosion  reduced soil fertility  desertification  the loss of bio-diversity  the contamination of rivers  lakes and oceans  reduced ozone-layer protection  and climatic change - to name but a few factors.Although our planet's environmental tragedies are sometimes more visible in third-world countries  the industrialised countries must be aware of their special responsibility in this field.With respect to population growth  two factors - responsible behaviour by parents  and the economic and social situation of the countries concerned - must be taken into account to ensure sustainable development for those countries. We know that sustainable development is not only an issue of value structures and behaviour patterns in our society; it is  above all  a challenge to resource allocation.A major issue in attaining sustainable development is  however  related to the use of energy resources. Studies undertaken at the Vienna-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis sketch some eerie scenarios in respect of climatic changes. One of the most urgent priority measures - one to be undertaken in the immediate future - is reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases. Energy policy has become so important for our societies  developing and industrialised alike  that it is high time for political leaders of the world to take a closer look at our options.The year 1991 will mark the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Conference on Kew and Renewable Sources of Energy. The Programme of Action adopted in Nairobi and its institutional follow-up have led to pertinent conclusions and to improved co-ordination within the United Nations system. The potential of new and renewable sources of energy is known to be enormous. Under different circumstances  renewable sources of energy could already be contributing to the world's energy supply to a much greater extent. The still abundant supply of conventional energy should not blind us to the fact that we are wasting irreplaceable resources.A number of nongovernmental organisations  such as BUSO-SOLAB  are increasingly demanding that the issue of the development and more appropriate use of renewable sources of energy should find expression within a high  institutional framework within the United Nations system.The development and dissemination of new technologies have not yet received adequate attention. Indeed  in some countries  funds dedicated to research and development in this field have suffered substantial cutbacks. This is deplorable and short-sighted. I would propose  therefore  that we should listen more attentively to the warnings of scientists. This would lead us to look for means by which Governments could jointly review their energy policies  in particular  in the light of the threats to our environment. The global aspects of conventional energy supplies require close international co-operation in order to adjust national energy policies to the new environmental challenges.At its fifth session  the Intergovernmental Committee on the Development and Utilisation of New and Renewable Sources of Energy decided to convene  in 1991  a group of experts to assess the implementation process of the Nairobi Plan of Action. We welcome this initiative  as well as the efforts made to prepare a significant contribution to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We hope that this will lead to a strengthening of the efficiency of the existing institutional framework. A special conference as part of the follow up to the United Nations Conference on environment and Developing could lead to a strengthening of inter-State co-operation in order to meet the new energy and environment challenge. This conference could also reconsider the role of the United Nations in this field.In my view  the task of the United Nations would be to supplement and support all developments stemming from private initiatives  which could be carried out under free market conditions  they are all required to encourage the efforts made to assure the reliability of new methods of energy production and to attain higher levels of efficiency in the use of the energy currently at our disposal. My delegation has prepared a memorandum on international energy policy which will be conveyed to the other delegations. We would be grateful for comments and observations.The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in 1992  could be the most important diplomatic event for the international community before the year 2000  its effects reaching far beyond this date. This Conference will be instrument in expediting progress in respect of global environmental problems and will result in a new global strategy for achieving sustainable development  and  beyond that  in a new form of economic and social thinking: the output of the free market economy must meet social requirements and environmental needs. Only such a concept of the market economy is consistent with human dignity.In the future environmental diplomacy will become ever more important and difficult. We must acknowledge that the demands on environmental resources and the requirement to conserve then will both continue to increase. As a result  conflicts over the development and use of resources could become more frequent  and could even threaten international peace. Last year  I proposed to the Assembly that a corps of “Green Helmets” should be established  that is  a system to deal with the prevention and settlement of environmental disputes. On the basis of the covenants received  we have developed a more specific set of ideas  which have been submitted to the second special session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program· (UKBP) and to the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which at in Nairobi in August this year. I hope this initiative will contribute to the efforts being undertaken to address this new  complex challenge to international peace and co-operation.The current session of the General Assembly will have to take crucial decisions with regard to international co-operation against the illicit production  supply  trafficking and distribution of drugs and psychotropic substances and against the demand for then. Any decision taken with respect to a new United Nations drug structure should reflect the fact that the social aspects of drug abuse  therapies  rehabilitation and reintegration programmes  as well as the interdependence between drug abuse and crime  require cross-sectoral activities within institutions dealing with drugs and social policies.Full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all are a prerequisite for a life in dignity and the wall-being of every individual. Austria regards the promotion and protection of human rights as corner-stones of its constitution and foreign policy. The full realisation of human rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Sights and other important international instruments is a permanent obligation accepted by the global community. As a member of the Commission on Hunan Rights  Austria will support every effort to prevent human rights abuses and will contribute to constructive and effective work by the Commission.In view of the contemporary world as we see it  Austria expresses its satisfaction at the resonance of the Charter of San Francisco. Indeed  nowadays the human conditions of the peoples of the United Nations is no different from the concept its authors had in mind: war  injustice and poverty are still the scourges of mankind. The United Nations  we all  are constantly called to fight then.Without respect for those fundamental principles I have just referred to and without determination to implement them  we will not have a chance to achieve success in the pursuit of these most noble goals."
"9",444,"BDI",45,1990,"﻿I have the honour to convey to the President a message of peace  fraternity  friendship and wishes for every success at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly addressed to him by His Excellency Major Pierre Buyoya  President of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic of Burundi.On behalf of ray delegation I should also like to express to Mr. de Marco my sincere congratulations on his accession to preside over our work. We are convinced that thanks to his human qualities  his diplomatic experience and his dedication to the ideals of peace our deliberations will be crowned with success. In electing him President of the General Assembly the international community has expressed its confidence in him and in his country  the Republic of Malta. I should also like to congratulate the other officers of the Assembly who will  we are sure  spare no effort to assist him in the discharge of his lofty duties. I assure them that my delegation will give its full support in carrying out their mandate.I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba  for the highly praiseworthy work ho accomplished during his mandate. That outstanding diplomat is the pride of Africa and of his country  Nigeria. I should also like to express my warm thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for the many efforts  as positive as they are tireless  which he has constantly made throughout the past year for the maintenance of international peace and security. I take this opportunity to congratulate him most warmly on having accomplished the decolonisation of Namibia  a friendly and fraternal country  which my delegation once again welcomes into the United Nations family. I also welcome Liechtenstein  which has just joined the great United Nations family.Before stating my country's views on some of the items of the agenda of this session  allow me to describe briefly the situation now obtaining in my country.On 3 September 1990 we celebrated the third anniversary of the proclamation of the Third Republic. Over the past three years  the Government of Burundi has ceaselessly pursued the fundamental objectives it had set itself  namely  national unity  social justice and development for all in a genuine democracy. Since its installation  the regime of the Third Republic has undertaken to strengthen unity and reconcile all the people of Burundi  so that together- they can build the future of their country. The people of Burundi aspire to live in peace  order and tranquillity. They wish to bequeath to their children a country of unity  from which hatred and vengeance have been banished. It was in that spirit that the Head of State  in September 1938  appointed a commission to study the issue of national unity. The commission produced a report  which was made available to national and international public opinion on 13 May 1989.Last year  I had the privilege of describing to you  from this very rostrum  the major outlines of that report  concerning which there has been a wide-ranging democratic debate throughout the country. I am pleased to be able to tell you that several of the report's recommendations have already been implemented. One of the main recommendations of the report was that a charter of national unity should be drafted. The commission was thus given a mandate to produce a draft charter  which all the people of Burundi were invited to discuss. The debate took place at all levels and in all sectors of national life. Many of our people  from diverse social and occupational backgrounds  responded to the appeal and studied the issue of national unity honestly and thoroughly. They also made useful suggestions concerning the content of the draft charter  which was published on 16 May 1980 and subjected to thorough scrutiny. It expounds fundamental human rights and freedoms - the right to life  freedom of expression and association  freedom of religion and the right to own property. The charter also includes a commitment by the people of Burundi to reject violence  extermination and vengeance. It calls on the people of Burundi to defend equality  justice and democracy.The publication of the draft charter is an important event for the people of Burundi because our citizens are coming to realize more and more that unity is the basis for any political and social organization and for development. In submitting the draft charter of national unity  the Head of State  Major Pierre Buyoya  said: ""By adopting the charter  the people of Burundi will have proclaimed its Burundi identity before all other affiliations. It will have made the undertaking to fight for national unity in order to keep Burundi a country of unity and peace"". The people of Burundi will also have undertaken to fight for equality of all before the law and to reject unjustified generalizations and all forms of discrimination based on ethnicity  region and clan. To prepare for its future  the people of Burundi must stress the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation and scrupulously respect the right to life. The charter will be a pact among all the people of Burundi. It will be the basic text and the foundation of the definitive institutions which will set all the Burundi people on the democratic road.When the charter was published  on 16 May 1990  the Head of State announced the main deadlines in the country's political calendar. At the end of this year  the UPROMA party - the Union for National Progress - will hold an extraordinary congress  expanded to include all the representative forces in the country  in order to adopt the draft charter of national unity and also the charter of economic and social development. The congress will set up a party central committee to replace the Military Committee for National Salvation  which was installed when the Third Republic came into being. Two months later  the Burundi people will proceed by referendum to adopt the draft charter of national unity. Immediately thereafter  a constitutional commission will be set up  with a mandate to develop a draft constitution  which will also be adopted by referendum. On that occasion the Burundi people will  in complete freedom  choose the form of political organization it prefers. The institutions which will be set up will thus meet the people's deepest aspirations. The people will exercise its sovereign choice between a single-party and a multiparty system. The people of Burundi intend to establish a democracy which will ensure peace and unity  leading to development for all without distinction. We do not want to create institutions in haste  for they might not reflect the aspirations of the Burundi people.We call on our neighbours  on all friendly countries and on all our partners to continue to show support for us. We believe that peace and development in Burundi will be a contribution to the struggle for peace and prosperity throughout the world. Unity and development are goals which are intimately linked. The political reforms have been accompanied by economic reforms aimed at restoring the major macroeconomic balances  at reviving economic growth and at raising standards of living. The economic reforms are part of a structural-adjustment programme which has support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank and our other partners. Adopting the structural-adjustment Programmes has not affected Burundi's development guidelines. It has been a tool for good management in implementing the country's priorities for economic and social development.Even if we have been unable to achieve all the expected results  over the past two years we have been seeing an improvement in the balance of payments  an increase in tax revenue  in administrative dues collected and  generally speaking  in control over public expenditure. In order to reduce the social cost of the reforms  a programme to cover the social dimension of the structural adjustment was introduced. The reforms are continuing despite the difficult circumstances  which include the debt burden  the collapse in the market for coffee - our main export - and the increase in the price of oil.Ws are convinced that increased support from our friends is indispensable if we are to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves. The international community is well aware that underdevelopment is one of the factors creating divisions and conflicts between peoples. We should like to take this opportunity to thank the friendly countries and organisations which have given us their constant support in this process of economic reform.One of the recommendations of the commission established to study the question of national unity was that an economic and social council should be set up. That consultative body  answerable to the Head of State  was set up on 15 March 1990 with the mission of studying and analysing national economic and social problems and providing advice and suggestions on policy directions to the executive branch. This Council is an ideal framework for in-depth thought on economic questions in our country. The establishment of the Economic and Social Council is another step along the road of openness and democracy. We consider that the major economic and social questions in our country are challenges and  in this respect  are of concern to everyone. Their solution thus requires the contribution of the national community as a whole through free and open thinking and debate. This is why the composition of the Council was motivated by a desire for broad representation without discrimination  be it regional  ethnic and  even less  socio-professional.True to its policy of national unity to ensure the well-being of all the people of Burundi  the Head of State met up a national security council in July 1990. In fact  the security of a country cannot be the business of the police or the army. It is a responsibility that lies with all citizens.The Security Council comes within a comprehensive framework to build and consolidate the unity of the people of Burundi. It is entrusted with defining and orienting the national security policy. For the first time in the history of our country  a body has been set up which will consider problems of security within a more comprehensive framework  one that is more open and more transparent.The Security Council  comprising eminent State personalities  will strive to restore and reaffirm confidence among the people of Burundi. It will be called upon to make decisions in peacetime and  above all  in times of crisis. The Council will help to revive feelings of unity and solidarity in times of happiness  as well as in times of misfortune  since it is true that  in order to overcome any crisis  above all we must have unity. The establishment of this Council follows the same logic as that which led to the establishment of the Unity Government in October 1988  the appointment of a national Commission to study the question of national unity  and the establishment of the Economic and Social Council. Despite the priority given to our domestic policy  Burundi is convinced that our era is one in which interdependence and solidarity among nations  regions and peoples are indispensable.The common destiny of mankind in the face of the many dangers threatening all countries  large or snail  rich or poor  has become an indisputable reality  like the fundamental aspirations of all nations and of all peoples for well-being and peace.Detente and the desire for peace  which now characterise international relations  are very encouraging for the international community as a whole. The improvement in Soviet-American relations  for the entire world  contains great hops for stability in that it offers the prospect for peace and fruitful co-operation.Moreover  my country continues to follow with particular attention the rapid changes occurring in Eastern and Central Europe  the major progress achieved by the European Economic Community towards establishing a single market and political union and the new prospects for integration for that continent.The reunification of the two Germanys is an historic event at the end of the twentieth century. It marks the end of a period of antagonism between blocs and opens up better prospects for peace in the world.This gives us great pleasure  and we hope that the German nation  which will now play a decisive role in the European system  will use its economic power to strengthen North-South co-operation  as we all hope.We are being confronted with a unique historic opportunity  towards which all efforts should converge in order to consolidate the favourable trends and make then irreversible  thus giving a new dimension to relations among States.Lately  detente and dialogue in international relations have been essential elements  which have made it possible to take dynamic and concrete initiatives to facilitate the settlement of many conflicts. In southern Africa  the Namibian people have seen their efforts of many years crowned by their independence on 21 March 1990. We must now reflect on the quality assistance to be given to the young Namibian nation so as to enable it to ensure its full independence in the best possible conditions.The peace process that has been developing for some time in Angola and Mozambique  thanks to the efforts made by the various messengers of peace  must be strengthened and encouraged in order to enable these two countries to preserve their sovereignty and to devote themselves fully to economic development activities.As to South Africa  my delegation reaffirms its condemnation of the hateful system of apartheid. However  the various measures taken by the Government of South Africa encourage a certain optimism. Moreover  the agreement of 7 August 1990 between the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress of South Africa (AMC) are of great importance on the road towards true peace. While pleased with this step  Burundi calls for talks to continue in order to achieve an agreement aimed at dismantling apartheid fully  thus establishing a multiracial and democratic society. Finally  we call on our black brothers of South Africa to halt all acts of violence and to unite in order to wage the last battle against apartheid more effectively. The international community  for its part  must maintain its support for the AMC and for the other movements involved in the struggle for a more just society.Still on Africa  the question of Western Sahara has made encouraging progress. Can we finally hops that  after the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on Western Sahara  published on 20 June  the best possible conditions will be found to organise a referendum so as to implement the joint peace plan of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity for the settlement of this question? As to the Middle East  we must mobilize to seek peace in this region together. Burundi supports and encourages all initiatives taken to restore peace among the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. However  we regret the lack o£ real progress  owing to the rejection of the various peace initiatives by one of the parties to the conflict. Burundi hopes that the Palestinians and the Israelis will soon meet at an international conference to discuss the terms for the establishment of the long-awaited peace.It is high time that the pressures and sufferings of the populations of the occupied Arab territories were halted  and that the Palestinian people regained its inalienable right to a sovereign State in secure and internationally recognized borders.As to the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq  my delegation deplores and condemns the violation by the occupying Power of the rules of international law governing the respect of territorial integrity  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and non-use of force in the settlement of disputes. The invasion and occupation of small States by large ones cannot be tolerated in our era. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq is all the more serious in that it complicates a situation which is already tense in the region  and as it threatens to provoke a conflict with incalculable consequences.At this time  the poor non-oil-producing countries are finding themselves in an extremely grave crisis  which is destroying all their development efforts. The measures envisaged for countries considered to be the most affected should be extended to the poorest countries  where the crisis has worsened an already bad economic situation. Burundi  like other peace-loving nations  calls on Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait so that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State may be restored. Once again  the United Nations is being called upon to play fully its role to ensure respect for the principles of law contained in the Charter.As regards Cambodia  Burundi expresses its satisfaction with the agreement between the parties to the conflict for the framework proposed by the five permanent members of the Security Council for a comprehensive and lasting political settlement to the question. Moreover  we urge them to strengthen the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation and to avoid fratricidal confrontation. With respect to the Korean peninsula  my country supports the principle of peaceful reunification and encourages the two parties to continue the dialogue which has been begun so that this process may be rapidly concluded. The Korean people must regain its sovereignty  its dignity and its unity. It is imperative that the work of reunification of the Korean nation and of its people  which share a culture forged by a common thousand-year-old history  be achieved through a reduction of tension in the region by the demolition of the wall which divides them so that an opening may take place between the North and the South. Thus  we may soon welcome among the family of the United Nations a single Korean nation.In Central America  the results of the Tela agreements are very encouraging. We hope that the normalization of relations among the countries of the region will become irreversible.This is a very propitious opportunity for my delegation to express once again to the Assembly its admiration for the steadily growing role played by the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts under the impetus of its tireless Secretary-General. The entire world cannot but be pleased with these encouraging political results  which have strengthened our Organization. However  these results should not hide the economic malaise which  in the near future  could jeopardize the delicate balance that the world has just regained with difficulty.In fact  in our developing countries the continuing drop in commodity prices  the dizzying escalation in the prices of manufactured goods  the increasingly heavy burden of external debt  the rise in interest rates and the reverse in the flow of our resources are challenges which are destroying our development efforts and are obstacles that we must overcome in order to ensure harmonious and sustained development. We must find increased agreement in the efforts of Governments of the international community. In this respect  it should be possible to mobilize more effectively the resources necessary for a more complete and more general development  particularly through the direct support of existing regional economic groups. These groups  in our view  are the realistic way to economic development.With respect to the domestic field  many developing countries  in co-operation with multilateral financing and development institutions  have made courageous efforts to adjust their economies. In the face of an unstable and risky economic and environment  it is becoming increasingly difficult to envisage a better tomorrow.In the short term  the results achieved by these adjustment policies can be summed up in terms of sacrifice and privation. International assistance is urgently needed to reverse the trend towards the impoverishment of a large part of humanity and to stimulate their economic growth.For my delegation  development assistance seems to be a moral duty  based on human solidarity which refuses to let millions of human beings die from the ills which underdevelopment has created. In Africa  for example  in the 1980s  as recognised quite recently by the Heads of State and Government who met in Addis Ababa for the summit of the Organization of African Unity  most of the means of production and infrastructures have been constantly deteriorating. The per capita income of populations has fallen considerably  and resources devoted to public health  housing  education and other social services have been reduced  leading to a deterioration in the living standards of our populations.We thus hope that the debate in this Assembly will lead to concrete results and will meet the urgent needs for development. The United Nations  we are sure  will achieve these results. Proof of this is the Final Declaration of the Second United Nations Conference of Least Developed Countries  adopted unanimously last month. We call on the developed countries to uphold their commitments to support the development efforts made by our countries.Among the diplomatic events to which my country attaches the greatest importance is the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Brazil in less than two years. The present political climate is pushing further and further back the nuclear threat  but the violence of man against nature is also a grave threat to survival. That Conference will be an important stage in the drafting of a common policy for eliminating imbalances and promoting true world co-operation in order to preserve the environment  the common home of the whole of mankind.My delegation would like to stress most strongly its desire to see the development dimension given the same importance as that given to the environment dimension. We are pleased with the increasing recognition of this view by the international community and we hope that the various preparatory sessions of that Conference will draft the best possible strategies for success.We hope that this Conference will result not only in a clear and unconditional policy for preserving the environment  but that it will also encourage the adoption by developed countries of policies that will promote the growth of a world economy compatible with the global objectives and major imperatives for development.Apart from the fears created by the deterioration of our environment  there are scourges such as drugs that no less seriously undermine our societies. We are pleased with the determination with which the fight against drugs has been carried out  but we recall that  in order to ensure victory  we must not neglect or underestimate the importance of a single front. We must show unceasing and unfailing solidarity. It is customary to talk a great deal about questions of human rights is all their aspects both civil and political. In the view of my country  human rights should be understood in a really global fashion  including economic  social κ .л cultural rights  without forgetting the right to development.The World Summit for Children  held here in New York on 29 and 30 September last  showed that on this place  which we so strongly desire to preserve from all scourges  children are the actors of tomorrow.In his message to the Summit meeting  Major Pierre Buyoya  President of the Republic of Burundi  said:""The World Summit for Children is appropriate at this time because the care and protection of children have become a moral duty rooted within wisdom and the culture of our societies. Nevertheless  present problems such as war  violence  underdevelopment  indebtedness and degradation of the environment may distract the attention of leaders and political decision-makers with regard to the special nature of children and their decisive role in the future of the world.""Burundi  which has already ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child  has solemnly undertaken to do everything possible to ensure the support end implementation of the recommendations contained in the Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted by the world leaders at the World Summit for Children  Our Organisation has thus taken on additional step on the road towards creating a world where we must safeguard our achievements for future generations."
"10",491,"BEL",45,1990,"﻿First of all. Sir  I congratulate you warmly on your election to your high office. 1 am convinced that your great experience and wisdom will be reflected in your term as President  and I assure you of my delegation's full support. I wish also to convey our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba. I pay a tribute as well to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the way in which he embodies the work and spirit of the Organization.In my statement last year I alluded to the famous remark made by my eminent predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak more than 40 years ago before a General Assembly sharply divided by the cold war and paralysed by the East-West conflict: ""We are frightened"".Today even more than last year we can and must speak out and say that we are frightened no more. On the contrary  after so many years of tension  suspicion and latent or indirect conflict between East and Nest  we are today filled with great hope and renewed confidence.Detente between Nest and East is becoming understanding  and confrontation is becoming co-operation  all at an astounding pace. To mention but one forum  at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) we are formulating a structure of peace and security reaching from San Francisco to Vladivostok  and embracing Europe with all its countries and capitals which bear the wounds and scars of the innumerable wars that have broken out in the Old World over the millennia. It would be pointless and provocative today to try to assess the cold war in terms of winners and losers. It is history that has triumphed  and history has certainly not come to an end. The hopes and dreams of tens of millions of men and women vanquished the totalitarian forces of a utopian ideology incompatible with an ethically and socially balanced conception of humanity. For everybody is somebody  and it was on the basis of that simple truth deeply rooted in the soul of individual and peoples that the great movement of liberalisation and freedom was built up in recent months. We ought to pay a tribute to the leaders  politicians  people with a social conscience  academics  people in the arts and those involved with religion who  at their own risk  chose to break with totalitarianism  bureaucracy  inefficiency» stagnation  stereotyped language  manipulation of truth and history rewritten. In the context of East-West understanding  we acclaim with the most immense satisfaction the result on 3 October of the negotiations leading to German unification. This is a milestone in the construction of a new Europe which will contribute to stability of the European continent.Europeans themselves  primarily  must design and put together the elements in the new architecture which will form the framework for pan-European relations; however  for obvious  political reasons  establishing a peaceful order in Europe and putting it into practice can be possible only through wide-ranging co-operation with the United States and the Soviet Union and through co-operation between those two Powers. The transatlantic relationship should none the less not give way to a trans-Ural one; that would be a nonsense now that East-West rivalry is a dead letter. On the contrary  the Atlantic Alliance can and must  in our opinion  be transformed into an instrument for security and co-operation with our fellow Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) countries.Obviously  implementing and monitoring mutual disarmament are of absolute priority  not only as they are instances of the most essential  confidence and security-building measures  but also because the construction of a European architecture and order of peace is conditional upon a sufficient degree of disarmament. We hope  therefore  that the Vienna disarmament talks will quickly yield a satisfactory outcome  and that the 23 participating States will be able to sign a final agreement at the forthcoming CSCE Conference on 19 November.The CSCE must also be the basis for a second round of negotiations  a CSCE-II  which should lead to quantitative and  particularly  qualitative reductions in arsenals  in order finally to make armed aggression impossible. This is vital for Europe  a mutual  controlled and irreversible disarmament exercise of this kind must become the basis for a European security community in which the defence of the countries taking part will indeed mean ""defence"" in the strictest sense of the term. Disarmament of this kind must  however  retain the capacity to deter  as our planet is hardly safe while irresponsible loaders shamelessly resort to blackmail and military occupation  as we have very recently seen happen.As a European country and a founder member of the European Community  my country deems it of the highest importance that the Community should play the role which falls to it within the CSCE in a consistent manner  speaking with a single voice  building peace  advocating economic  social and cultural co-operation  and serving as an example of political unification.Organising a new and greater Europe based on co-operation must take the principle of complementarily as its premise. This means that  wherever possible  existing institutions should be used to the full  and that we should avoid setting up new institutions whose usefulness cannot be demonstrated in advance. Belgium therefore much prefers to set up co-operation mechanisms rather than create a new wave of Institutions. For example  in the field of human rights  the Council of Europe  with 21 members at present  should be able to play an important role by welcoming in new members in a spirit of openness  while still maintaining the standards and values it has set in the past.The great attraction of the Council of Europe is  in our opinion  that it has a legal tribunal which keeps a watch on whether the mandatory provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights are being observed. It would be wrong to think that human rights are best protected by each State  acting in a sovereign manner and remote from any external interference. The development of international law shows very clearly that there is a need to give the international community a supervisory brief. We think that  on a world scale  the United Nations has an essential task to carry out in this field. In purely political matters  the Security Council is capable of acting promptly  as we have seen in these past weeks and even yesterday. But where human rights are concerned  the procedure is  unfortunately  slow  and conclusions are most often reached only when an irreversible situation has already occurred in the offending country. Belgium would therefore like to see a study carried out of how United Nations procedures in the human rights field could be speeded up  and would very much like this matter to be put to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.In the field of economic and scientific co-operation - the central element of the so-called second basket of the Helsinki Final Act - I would like to draw your attention to the activities of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); that organization should be renewed from the inside and open itself to co-operation with other countries wishing to adopt economic policies based on free market principles  that is  the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  including even the Soviet Union. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe could also  in future  play a role of prime importance here.In respect of the first basket of the Helsinki Final Act - which covers disarmament and security - we believe that procedures should be set up involving regular consultations and information exchanges between the Foreign Ministers of the 35 member States - soon to be only 34 - and that the Heads of State or Government should also meet at regular intervals to establish what the content of the co-operation between their States should be. This should go together with the establishment of a small general secretariat and  perhaps  the involvement of CSCE diplomatic representatives. We are in favour of setting up a system to prevent conflicts  based on exchanges of information  on consultations and on mediation and arbitration. Together with the Netherlands and Luxembourg  Belgium has developed a specific proposal to this end. However  I feel that we may go much further. The Helsinki Final Act of 1975 has been of crucial importance in generating the wave of liberalisation in the socialist countries. But we must bear in mind that the Final Act is still a political document without any binding legal force. We therefore think that to complete the process initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) a charter for security and co-operation in Europe  enforceable under international law  is needed. We might envisage giving the International Court of Justice at The Hague an important role to play in that process. We could also consider the creation of a specific legal forum. The core issue is that signatory States should accept the jurisdiction of such a forum and abide by its decisions.Belgium is also greatly concerned about the problems arising out of ethnic diversity within State borders and the presence of ethnic minorities. Corrections of State borders do not seem to us the best solution. Demands put forward in that sense tend to aggravate conflicts even further. The history of Europe prior to the First World War and in the inter-war period should inspire us to consider timely measures to avoid any form of neo-Balkanization. We believe that the proper handling of such questions is possible only given respect for human rights  and thus through the application of the ""third basket"" of the Helsinki Final Act. However  adequate institutional solutions must also be found. Speaking from our own experience  tie in Belgium are of the view that the granting of extensive cultural autonomy in various matters relating to private and community questions of a personal nature - including language  religious freedom and the organisation of education - can prepare the ground for a peaceful solution. Such a solution is advisable because it is compatible with the survival of States  provided political leaders demonstrate suitable mutual restraint.Finally  the credibility of a security charter for Europe would be enhanced if - again in the longer run - we were to consider the establishment of a Multilateral security corps for Europe and made up of contingents from the smaller European States. The political and psychological impact of such a European peace-keeping force on the Europe of the future could be profound and constitute a nodal for other continents. Let We add at once that  obviously  pan-European security remains to a large extent dependent on the quality of co-operation and understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union in security matters. For that reason we favour the speedy signature of a declaration of non-aggression by as great a number of States as possible.However paradoxical it may sound  tomorrow's Europe is more easily defined in terms of values than in terms of geographical boundaries. In my view the Europe of values encompasses all countries within and outside the old continent that in their constitutional and legal practices subscribe to and observe respect for the human individual  pluralistic democracy  fundamental political and human rights  the efficiency of the market economy  the organisation of social-security systems  and so on.One remark often made by sceptics is that all we learn from history is that it teaches us nothing. There is  however  one important lesson of recent history that becomes ever clearer an ever-growing number of countries have almost empirically concluded that economic progress and social advance are necessarily linked with pluralistic democracy and the market economy. All in all  with the bankruptcy of centrally planned economies now such a dramatically illustrated fact  the market economy based on competition and complementarily stands out as the most workable economic system.If for the sake of efficiency the principle of economic competition is accepted  the same must hold true with regard to internal political life. Freedom to establish enterprises and trade unions must go hand in hand with the freedom to establish political parties that will present to voters blueprints for society in a context of political competition.In pronouncing ourselves in favour of the market economy we do not mean just any form of it. Forms of market economy that deteriorate into economic empire-building  monopolies and oligopolies can be just as inefficient and Malthusian as State-run and bureaucratic economies. When compared. State capitalism end private monopoly capitalism show common negative features with regard to the degree of social well-being they generate. We do favour a sufficiently competitive market economy. Governments must  however  play an essential role in safeguarding fair play and guaranteeing equal opportunities for businessmen  as well as in eliminating abuses of power. An efficient market is a necessary  but not a sufficient  condition for social protection  social security and social justice.We are therefore strongly in favour of a market economy with a socially corrected course - in short  a social market economy  as it has been called in Western countries since the post-war economic miracle worked in the Federal Republic of Germany by the then Minister of Economic Affairs  Ludwig Erhard.Standing before this Assembly as a representative of a country of the North  I wonder how the majority of you  my friends and colleagues  representatives of the South  of great cultures of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Arab world  view and evaluate the growing understanding between the countries of the North and how  perhaps  it might inspire you with a measure of fear. Are not we  the people of the North  in the process of solving our problems and settling our affairs at the expense of our solidarity with the developing world and other continents? Are we not too arrogant  forever tempted to consider our model of society and our values as export product  suitable for all? I raise the question. Are we not shamelessly self-righteous when we keep on bringing up human rights issues when  in the relatively recent past  Europe itself has illustrated the most hideous violations of those rights?At a time when we of the North are constantly speaking of peace  I am fully aware of your unrest  your fears and your frustrations  nevertheless  allow We to stress that to date the facts do not support your fears. On the contrary  certainly as far as the European Community as a whole is concerned  never before have qualitative and quantitative levels of our aid been as high as they are today  and I can confirm here that not a single ECU (European currency unit) has been transferred from development aid to assistance to countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore  you have to bear in mind that the economic recovery of the Central and Eastern European countries offers additional markets and opportunities for co-operation to all countries of the world.At the same time  I draw your attention to the fact that as disarmament in the northern hemisphere progresses a ""peace dividend""  to be targeted primarily towards the poorest countries  becomes available. I hasten to add that it would be highly desirable if the example of the countries of the northern hemisphere  with their drastic disarmament and their reduction of military budgets  were to be followed by the countries of the southern hemisphere  which still devote an average of 20 per cent of their public spending to arms. They too would then be able to allocate more budgetary resources for civilian purposes. If non-aggression treaties are concluded between northern countries  why not also between southern countries or  for example  in the Middle East?It is obvious that Iraq's aggression against Kuwait constitutes a threat for other countries in the region as well. Belgium  together with the other members of the international community  and basing itself on the resolutions adopted by the Security Council  calls for an immediate Iraqi withdrawal from the territory of Kuwait  for the restoration of its sovereignty  and for the release of all foreign hostages.Moreover  Belgium is participating in the international solidarity effort. We have dispatched two minesweepers and one supply vessel to the Gulf. Most recently  yesterday  our Government dispatched an additional frigate. We have made available to Egypt two transport aircraft  C-1308  in order to assist in the evacuation of the many refugees. We are going to send four more transport aircraft to the region for purposes of logistic support. Moreover  we have granted 20 000 tons of wheat to Egypt as emergency aid  and we are participating in the financial effort for countries severely affected by the embargo.United Nations resolutions must be applied ne varietur. They are not negotiable. The United Nations faces an historic task: to enforce its own Charter and international law. Failure now would mean a particularly serious - possibly a fatal - loss of prestige that would lead the United Nations into the kind of situation in which the League of Nations found itself engulfed on the eve of the Second World War. It is thus of paramount importance for the United Nations to keep on taking all further steps needed for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The economic sanctions are an important  a crucial  experiment. If the world community succeeds in forcing a dictator to respect international law  without this leading to armed conflict  an essential precedent for the future of the entire family of nations will have been set.To restore Kuwait to its former status is  however  not sufficient to bring about a new equilibrium in the Middle East  The international community will have to strive for the prohibition of chemical weapons in the region  for the non-proliferation of nuclear arms  and for the reduction of levels of conventional weapons in general. Mechanisms for preventing conflict have to be taken into consideration. Hence  the idea was conceived of following the example of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and of bringing about for the Middle East a CSCME  a ""Conference on Security and Co-operation in the Middle East""  similar to the one existing for East-West relations.To achieve lasting stability and security in the Middle East  the other regional conflicts  and in particular the Palestinian question and the problems of Lebanon  have also to be addressed. The proposals made here in New York last Monday by the President of France  Mr. Mitterrand  go along the same lines as those that Belgium has been advocating.Moreover  Belgium attaches the greatest importance to the most intensive possible economic  industrial and technological co-operation with the countries of the Arab world. The European Community is looking forward to intensifying the Euro-Arab dialogue and wishes to establish co-operation schemes with the Gulf States  with the members of the UMA - the Maghreb countries - and with other regional organisations in the Arab world. Europeans and Arabs are both heirs to great and old cultures and our respective religions should teach us tolerance  mutual understanding and solidarity.The East-West détente is giving the United Nations  its Secretary-General and the specialised agencies of the United Nations much greater freedom of action than they have ever had in the past. We hope that this will transform the United Nations into an effective tool for world peace and co-operation in years to come at a global and fully effective and appropriate level Belgium  being a candidate for the Security Council at the elections to be held this year  assures the Assembly that as а member of the  Council we would endeavour to strengthen the positive influence of the United Nations and would favour its assuming its full responsibilities wherever and whenever required.All these considerations can  however  not do away with the fact that the countries of the North have the sacred duty to go beyond their statements of solidarity and that they have effectively to practice solidarity with other countries of the third world through structures of economic and political co-operation.It is precisely in that contest that we have to evaluate the solving of a number of regional problems and conflicts.Recent developments in Africa demonstrate that the call for more freedom and respect for human rights is not without echo on the continent. In a growing number of African countries there is an increasingly clear trend towards toward democratic political structures.We welcome the efforts that are being made to solve the problems in Angola and Mozambique  as well as the first steps towards a multiracial democracy in South Africa. In the recent past  such developments were mere dreams. Namibia's recent accession to independence and the way in which that independence was achieved prove that it is possible to make such dreams come true peacefully.A number of seemingly less burning issues  too  haw their importance for the future of mankind. One of those issues - and this is my last thought - is the protection of Antarctica. It is not enough to convert that continent into a nuclear-free peace zone; we must strengthen environmental protection in what is a particularly vulnerable territory.Belgium has done pioneering work in adopting legislation forbidding its nationals from participating in the· exploitation of mineral resources on Antarctica. We aspect the Antarctic system similarly to make the greatest efforts and to adopt measures to safeguard the future of the continent.The world offers the image of light and shadow  of great hope and great concern. As a faithful Member of the United Nations  and as a future member - so we hope - of the Security Council  Belgium will do its utmost to co-operate with all the countries of goodwill that strive for peace in justice."
"11",536,"BEN",45,1990,"﻿Sir  allow me  first of all  to follow the example of the eminent speakers preceding me in addressing this Assembly and convey to you the warm congratulations of the Republic of Benin on your well deserved election as President of the General Assembly at the forty-fifth session. Being familiar with your proven professional competence  your wide-ranging experience in international affairs and your exceptional qualities  the delegation of Benin is convinced that under your guidance the work of this session will be highly successful. I take pleasure also in paying a special tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Garba  who performed in a very skilful and effective manner the task of conducting the work of the General Assembly not only at the forty-fourth session but at three very important special sessions. Africa as a whole is proud of him and what he has accomplished.I feel it is my duty on this occasion also to pay a heartfelt tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar. His intelligence and his dedication have significantly strengthened this Organisation. The sound initiatives he has taken and his tireless efforts to promote the maintenance of international peace and security have greatly enhanced the prestige of the United Nations. This tribute applies also to the Secretary-General's associates and colleagues near and far  who have given so much of themselves in striving to ensure that our Organisation works effectively and that the noble ideals underlying its existence prevail in the world. The excellent annual report of the Secretary-General  on which I take pleasure in complimenting him publicly today  reflects the present prestige and unique role of the United Nations on the international scene. I should like also to congratulate the delegation of Liechtenstein  whose country has just been admitted as a Member of the United Nations.As we approach the end of the twentieth century  history is undergoing changes of exceptional depth and scope which call on mankind more and more pressingly to exercise its collective conscience with the passing of each month and each week we see further transformations taking place in the old international geo-political order.The era of confrontation is being gradually replaced by one of co-operation  and instead of bloc politics we are seeing the emergence and reinforcement of a spirit of solidarity and a heightened awareness of the need for complimentary approaches.A particularly striking symbol of this positive and healthy development in our times is  it seems to me  the reunification of Germany  the long-standing and legitimate dream of the German people  for so long jeopardized and delayed by the cold war but now at last a reality which we all applaud.However promising it may appear  the new international climate that now prevails should not blind us  amid the euphoria of real advances in democracy  freedom and international co-operation  to the fact that our world is still encumbered by dangerous imbalances  hotbeds of tension and intolerable injustices.The profound changes that are taking place will have fallen short of their ultimate objective if they fail to take into account all regional conflicts and to find the proper resolution of an issue that has become of primary importance for an Organisation that seeks to embody world-wide solidarity  namely  the fundamental problems of North-South relations and in particular those of the African debt and the continued impoverishment of the continent of Africa. The reforms that have been taking place in Eastern Europe have very quickly evoked active solidarity on the part of the Western world  and we can only welcome that. Our Western partners  furthermore  assure us that the vital assistance that they lend our economies will not cease in consequence. Nevertheless  I believe that everyone will appreciate our anxieties  confronted with the continued worsening of our situation  when we see the field of intervention of our traditional assistance providers being thus extended.I should like to take this opportunity to praise the far-sightedness of Mr. Mitterrand  President of the French Republic  and the bold initiatives he is taking to promote development and to bring about the establishment of a fairer and more balanced world order. The great and noble ideas that he champions with such admirable forcefulness and tenacity for the establishment of a more generous and rational world order and the relevant proposals he recently made in Paris at the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries will  we hope  be appreciated and acted upon by the industrialized countries  for our countries have need of assistance and deserve to be better supported - and I am thinking here particularly of Africa. Africa has suffered greatly from the distortions and injustices inherent in the way the world economic system is organised  but it is determined to overcome them  and to that end  it has already made enormous sacrifices.I particularly welcome  in this respect  the presence in this Hall of the delegation of Namibia  whose people  on 21 March 1990  at the cost of a long and heroic struggle  acceded to independence and sovereignty under the auspices of the United Nations  which successfully organised and conducted the elections that made it possible to establish the first free institutions in that country.The success thus achieved  with the active support of the entire international community  must be strengthened. It is therefore vital for us to do our utmost to ensure that Walvis Bay  Namibia's only deep-water port  illegally made part of South Africa  is unconditionally returned to the new State as soon as possible.It is now clear that the combined effects of the pressure applied by the international community and the tenacious struggle of the black majority in South Africa have prevailed over the inhuman apartheid system. Nelson Mandela and some of his companions in captivity are free. Even though much remains to be achieved in South Africa  we cannot fail to see that apartheid has been shaken to its very foundations  and we must accord President De Klerk the historical credit he deserves in that irreversible process. Unfortunately  there is still  no doubt  a long road  full of pitfalls  to be travelled before there will be a non-racial  free society in South Africa. The murderous violence that has been incited  encouraged and kept going by those who do not intend to renounce apartheid proves this very clearly.For that reason  all the States Members of the United Nations must remain vigilant and mobilised until the odious apartheid system has been fully dismantled. Then and only then will South Africa be able to become a truly great country that has finally renounced its role of policeman  so that it can work positively for peace  reconciliation and progress in all of southern Africa. The peoples of that region aspire to peace and development  and hope that a joint effort will be made by all to bring about a cease-fire and then the peace needed for reconstruction.In any event  we earnestly hope that the national reconciliation processes in Angola and Mozambique will continue normally  in order to put an end to their internal conflicts and bring about the peace longed for by the suffering people of those countries.Ī must now speak about the unhappy civil war in Liberia. The events in that country show to what tragic extremes any country may go when its people are subjected to the combined effects of poverty  dictatorship and corruption. There are some  either ill-informed or ill-intentioned  who keep telling us that tribalism is an inescapable fact of life that rules our destiny and is the primary cause of all Africa's ills. 1 would say  however  that Africa is becoming more and more aware of what its future requires  a future that cannot be fully secured except by large-scale integration and co-operation. In the depths of its soul  Africa aspires to economic and social progress in democracy and freedom. The horrifying images of the fratricidal war in Liberia challenge the consciences o£ us all  particularly of the most powerful among us.Liberia must be helped to end its self-destruction and the atrocities. It must be helped to become once again a sovereign State in which social peace and harmony reign. Africa must assume its responsibilities in this respect  through the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the subregional organisations  in accordance with the rules and principles it has set itself and in keeping with the higher interests of the African peoples. In Southern Africa  where the governments and people of the Maghreb are seeking greater co-operation  the praiseworthy efforts of our Secretary-General have not yet succeeded in bringing peace to Western Sahara. Benin reaffirms its support for the initiatives of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and hopes that the settlement plan set out in Security Council resolution 658 (1990) will bring about a self-determination referendum for the people of Western Sahara.Since our last session  the situation in the Middle East has not improved at all. On the contrary  it is more explosive today than it ever was. Just as we wore rejoicing at the hope for peace taking shape between Iran and Iraq  the Gulf crisis rekindled all the tensions and revealed in their most threatening aspect the dangers and anxieties which beset that particularly sensitive part of the world.The Republic of Benin takes the view that mankind faces real and pressing dangers if we do not reach  without delay  a global settlement of the problems of the Middle East. In our opinion  only an international conference under United Nations auspices  with participation on an equal footing by all the parties concerned  can solve those problems effectively and achieve a lasting peace which will guarantee the existence of Israel and of the Palestinian State within secure and recognised boundaries. Without such a conference  how would it be possible to put an end to the interminable war in Lebanon  to the destruction of that country  to the tragedy of the hostages and to terrorism?The Gulf crisis clearly shows that we cannot put off those vital settlements any longer without plunging the whole region into general ruin  desolation and instability  which will obviously have incalculable tragic consequences elsewhere in the world. We have stated in the past  hat we thought about the Iraqi-Kuwaiti conflict. The principle held dear by the OAU - that the frontiers inherited from colonisation must be inviolable  even if  in the final analysis  they satisfy nobody  is a very wise one. Bo lasting progress can be achieved by force  hegemonism or outright annexation. If the law of the jungle is encouraged instead of being stigmatised and combated  that is tantamount to justifying an order which condemns small countries to being arbitrarily attacked and dominated by those that are stronger. Respect for the norms of international law promotes progress  particularly for our States  which face the greed and hegemonism of the great Powers and of countries which possess some measure of power.The annexation of Kuwait by Iraq has not helped the peoples of the region it is an unjustified and inadmissible act which cannot and must not be condoned. Iraq must withdraw its troops from Kuwait unconditionally and immediately and restore the lawful and legitimate authorities of that country. Benin associates itself with any action to that end  in particular the effective implementation of all the Security Council resolutions on the subject. The situation in Afghanistan and Cambodia also call for our close attention. Benin hopes that the current negotiations will allow those two countries to regain peace and unity.The peaceful reunification of the two Yemens on 22 May 1990  and that of the two Germanys on 3 October 1990  should prompt the international community to step up its work to bring about a peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. Benin  which has restored its diplomatic relations with South Korea and which fervently hopes that it will be able to maintain and even strengthen its long-standing relations of friendship and co-operation with North Korea  will continue to strive actively for the achievement of unity and the independent and peaceful reconciliation of the peninsula.In Central America  Benin welcomes all the work now under way to restore peace and security to that region.Mow that we are seeing the end of the cold war and bloc politics  the most powerful among us should address themselves resolutely to defusing regional conflicts and should devote the necessary means to terminating the arms race and combating famine  poverty and disease. For  as we approach the end of the twentieth century  those scourges continue to be the daily lot of more than half of mankind  despite the tremendous resources with which the world is endowed and the fantastic advances of science and technology.The economic situation of the developing countries is hardly improving. It has even further deteriorated  and that is certainly the most serious threat to international peace and security. It is clear to all  in fact  that an order that allows half of the world to die of hunger and ignorance is not working towards peace and stability. Last Mat  at the end of the work of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to international economic co-operation  the Declaration adopted by the participants certainly sounded the alarm once again. That Declaration undoubtedly testifies to a greater awareness and should promote a positive change in international economic relations. It was in fact stressed that countries must draft their national policies so as to promote the liberalisation of trade and to respond with appropriate flexibility to the changes in the world economy.From 3 to 14 September 1S90 the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries was held in Paris  focussing on the economic and social situation in those countries. In the Final Declaration  adopted at the end of the Conference  it was recommended that the international community pay particular attention to that category of countries  given the specific nature of the crucial problems facing them.In this context  I should like to mention particularly the very disturbing situation of Africa. On this subject  the President of Egypt  Mohamed Hosni Mubarak  thon Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity  stated in his message on the occasion of the celebration of Africa Day on 25 May 1990  ""The time has come for international public opinion to become aware of the tragedy raging in Africa. The time has come for real dialogue and solid and fruitful co-operation to develop between North and South. Debtor and creditor countries must do their utmost to find concrete and effective ways and means of improving the economic situation of the African countries and of easing their acute financial crisis.""We are obliged to note today that the resolutions for a solution to the critical economic situation in Africa have not been implemented. The programmes adopted by common agreement  with their many promises  have not been carried out. Indeed  1990 is drawing to a close and the Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990  adopted by our Organisation four years ago  is still far from achieving the goals sat. That is why we urgently appeal to the developed countries finally to honour their commitment to provide sufficient resources to supplement and support Africa's development efforts.The reality today is that African States are being crushed by the burden of external debt which has grows constantly over the years  nevertheless  I should like to pay a tribute here to the praiseworthy efforts of certain creditor countries that have agreed to a partial deferral or forgiveness of certain debts of the third-world countries in general and of certain African debts in particular. Benin has benefited from these generous and greatly appreciated actions. We hope that  in the context of global agreement  these gestures will be turned into systematic policy. There is no other way out if we are to avoid disaster.Africa has already made end is still making enormous sacrifices. Many countries have  willy-nilly  adopted structural-adjustment programmes with the Bretton Moods institutions. We have courageously carried out economic and political reforms  improved our management systems  and combated corruption. Rave we not thus sufficiently lifted our part of the burden? But the harsh restrictions and many privations resulting from this must not plunge our peoples and States into despair  social unrest and political instability. It is thus more urgent today than ever before to build end strengthen hope for tomorrow's generations.The curtains have barely been rung down on the World Summit for Children  which was held in Kew York from 29 to 30 September and in which I had the honour to participate on behalf of my country. A Declaration and a Plan of Action were adopted for the survival  protection and development of the child. The summit has been the success demanded by the importance of the question. My delegation is very grateful to the summit initiators and organizers and hopes that the positive results will be translated into concrete actions for millions of innocent human being.But the people of tomorrow for whom we are trying to build a batter future may not reach adulthood if the growing threat that hangs over the human species because of the production of dangerous waste is not eliminated now by joint international action. Aware that the solution of ecological problems and the protection of the environment require co-ordination of States' activities sad initiatives  through the adoption of urgent decisions or subregional  regional or world Measures  Benin will participate actively in the organizing of the pan-African conference on the environment and lasting development that will be held in Bamako  Mali  and in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  planned for June 1992 in Brazil. I should like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that the new Constitution  which will soon be put to & referendum in my country  provides clear provisions in the area of applying the resolutions and recommendations of certain international and inter-African organisations relating to the acceleration by States of the process of inclusion in national legislation of regulations and measures on protection of the environment as provided by international law.Moreover  aware that the individual remains the subject and prime mover of any development and that there can be no real and lasting progress without freedom  new Benin  in accordance with the resolutions of the National Conference of Driving Forces of the Nation  held in Cotonou from 19 to 28 February 1990  has committed itself irreversibly to the road of building a State based on law and the active promotion and defence of human rights and the rights of peoples.In fact  firmly resolved to take in hand and to assume fully its national destiny in unity and peace  the Beninese people  thus rediscovering its values and its profound traditions  has decided to implement a gradual change of regime. At the end of its work the Conference of Driving Forces of the Nation  set up a High Council for the Republic  given legislative prerogatives  and elected a Prime Minister  who formed the transition government to carry out all the changes  including the setting up of new institutions  which will be introduced during 1991.Hence the press has been free and newspapers are multiplying in the country. The political parties set up are freely carrying out their activities. The main international instruments for the protection and defence of human rights have been ratified. There is a new atmosphere for the people of Benin.As Members no doubt know  the Benin Commission on Human Sights has been set up: it includes personalities from various walks of life. We have also set up a League for the Defence of Human Rights  which also includes former political prisoners. I have the honour  the satisfaction and the pride to confirm that there are no longer any political prisoners in Benin. This has been fully recognised by Amnesty International in correspondence sent to me recently. Any further arrest or detention for political or ideological opinions has now been banned  and the people of Benin intend that it should always be so.Allow me to say a few words on the completely new political context in which the general policy of the republic of Benin now lies. I crave your indulgence to speak about the political life of my country but  as representatives know  like the political life of each of your countries  it is reflected on its international relations.In the Republic of Benin today a new way of thinking has been born with the democratic renewal that  with ardour and determination  has brought the essential elements of democracy - that is  a Government of the people  by the people and for the people.Now  and I stress this  fundamental freedoms of all kinds  political pluralism  ideological non-alignment  separation of powers - legislative  and executive and the judiciary - and promotion and defence of human rights and the rights of peoples - all are concrete realities the people of Benin have been experiencing and implementing since the establishment of the democratic renewal.With the democratic renewal  we want to attain a great objective  a great project  that is  the deep transformation of society in Benin and the eradication of fatalism. We want to create a new person  because we believe in a new Africa. One of the main principles of our undertaking is transparency - transparency in affairs of State  transparency in justice  transparency in management of the economy and of public property. In other words  the democratic renewal is aimed at giving new life to a people through building a State based on law and new hope to a continent for which the gloomiest of futures is regularly predicted.We have dared to dream of a new world:Everyone can appreciate that a country grouped among the least developed  not to say among the poorest of the world  which  in such a short time has managed to put in place so many positive conditions needs support of a special and exceptional kind  because it is carrying out a democratic process in keeping with the profound aspirations of its people.This people  the people of Benin  recognise  with others  that between democracy and development there is a logical link and an almost mathematical relationship  which the National Conference of Cotonou graphically established. It is indisputable that the road leading to full democracy is long and full of pitfalls. But we have no other alternative to democracy.This is why I should like to make an urgent appeal to the industrialised countries and to the international organisations to give massive aid to nascent democracies in such developing countries as Benin so that they may have at their disposal as soon as possible the necessary conditions and the means for consolidation and thereby avoid economic stagnation and all kinds of evils and scourges.The forty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will we ardently hope  make it possible for us to enhance our achievements in maintaining international peace and security.We hope also that the understanding between the two super-Powers and the East-West rapprochement noted over the last two years will promote economic détente and will be turned into concrete measures aimed at easing the burden of the external debt of the developing countries and increasing assistance from the developed countries through substantial financial resources indispensable for carrying out viable socio-economic plans.Now Benin calls whole-heartedly for this new international order. Having courageously assumed its share of responsibility  it hopes that it can count on international co-operation.Forgive  e. Sir  if I have abused your patience and that of the distinguished representatives. The present state of our world requires that we stress certain points. And I also wanted to express and share the hope of a people that has resolutely started out on the arduous road to freedom and that  determined to take charge and to conquer fear  wretchedness and fatalism through its own abilities  also looks forward to enjoying the international co-operation and solidarity in which it profoundly believes."
"12",582,"BFA",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  events in Eastern and Central Europe that were gratifying to all of us occurred or were about to occur when the United States and the Soviet Union were meeting in your country. While congratulating you on being elected to your high office  I also wish to pay tribute to Malta  a non-aligned country that provided the background for one of the episodes that accompanied - and perhaps contributed to - the fundamental changes in present-day international relations.I should also like to pay tribute to Joseph Garba of Nigeria  who presided with talent and authority over the forty-fourth session of the Assembly  during which  inter alia  we adopted by consensus a Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa; that Declaration played a part in creating the international climate which led to the release of that great fighter  Nelson Mandela. If the United Nations today is witnessing not a rebirth but a new birth  we also owe this to the tireless efforts  great patience and calm perseverance of the Secretary-General who  true to his mission and his responsibilities  has upheld against all odds the principles  purposes and objectives of the Charter. The independence of Namibia  which we welcomed here in April upon its admission to the Organisation  was one of his principal concerns.Just as we hail unified Yemen and unified Germany  we also welcome among us with particular pleasure Liechtenstein  whose initiative gives further proof of the universality of the Organization's usefulness in these difficult and uncertain times.Barely had we witnessed the final throes of the East-West confrontation when we found ourselves at a new turning-point in history. A combination of geopolitics  selfish considerations  half-truths  cunning tricks and flagrant bias have brought us to our present pass. Iraq has invaded Kuwait  and Burkina Faso  like the rest of the international community  condemns that flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the sovereign rights of a Member State. Today the situation is at worst an intolerable attack on law and justice and at best a conflict between law and justice.Nevertheless  the clear-sightedness and experience of peoples prevent them from being misled by concealed interests that by their nature are constant and unchanging. Principles that were ignored in similar situations in the past are now being cited for the sake of those interests. In the name of that clear-sightedness and experience  I should like to set forth Burkina Faso’s view of the problems that beset us and that make the struggle for justice and peace so loner and so arduous. The important political  economic and social changes that we have witnessed and participated in are occurring along a line and in a context that is gradually beginning to be seen for what it really is: a split papered over with the un-kept promises of some and the un-avowed purposes of others. By engaging in such fruitless exercises we are quite simply compromising the future of the world's children  even though last Sunday in this very Hall we solemnly recognized that ""There can be no task nobler than giving every child a better future"".In whatever context we place them  the problems are numerous and the solutions few. A good climate makes a good harvest only if the seed is good. What kind of seed are we sowing?In the Middle East the situation  under the impact of the events in the Gulf region  remains highly sensitive  the more so because we do not understand what difference there is between an annexation that took place two months ago and another that has now persisted and been developing in various unofficial but concrete forms for 22 years. The immigration of Soviet and Eastern European Jews to the occupied Arab territories is further inflaming an open wound. The intifadah continues to be a revolt against injustice and a call for justice to prevail.The convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  bringing together all the parties concerned  is becoming an increasingly pressing imperative for those who seek a genuine and definitive solution to the problem.Lebanon  which has long been the victim of a conflict that is overwhelming it  awaits the restoration of its State and the coming of national reconciliation. We hope that the efforts of the Tripartite Commission will be successful.With regard to Afghanistan  my country remains concerned at the pernicious continuance of fratricidal combat. A comprehensive political settlement in accordance with the consensus resolutions adopted at the forty-third and forty-fourth sessions of the General Assembly should be supported in order to achieve the unity and harmony needed for the country's reconstruction and development.In Korea the opening of preliminary discussions at Seoul foreshadows a better future for reunification. Burkina Faso is of the view that one way to encourage that process would be to avoid taking negative and partisan attitudes and thus to enable the long-divided Korean people to reunite.With regard to Cambodia  we hope that the framework document of 28 August 1990 drawn up by the five permanent members of the Security Council will lead to an agreement among all the parties to the conflict and that peace will come back to stay.Reaffirming Burkina Faso's support for the unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus  we hope that the Secretary-General's mission of good offices will bear fruit.My continent  Africa  is prey to acute conflicts  for which  we feel  the international community should  in one way or another  help to find a peaceful settlement. More specifically  with regard to Western Sahara  Burkina Faso continues to support the joint good offices of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It expresses its satisfaction at the adoption of Security Council resolution 658 (1990) on 27 June 1990 and hopes that the organization of a true referendum on self-determination will bring lasting peace and stability to the region. With regard to Liberia  Burkina Faso reaffirms its firm support for an appropriate solution and stresses the urgent need for increased humanitarian assistance to the Liberian people. Burkina Faso supports the convening of a special summit meeting of the Economic Community of West African States to promote reconciliation and a peaceful and definitive resolution of that fratricidal conflict.In Mozambique and Angola  we encourage the efforts being carried out to restore peace through dialogue.In South Africa  apartheid remains  and although Nelson Mandela is out of prison he is not yet free. Burkina Faso  along with the international community  is waiting for the abolition pure and simple of apartheid and is waiting for Mr  De Klerk to take irreversible steps in that direction. The economic sanctions are still necessary  and the South African people must maintain the same vigilance in the face of attempts at division and the fomenting of internal strife.Agreement  co-operation and now interaction between the two military super-Powers mark a break with the past and are producing an impact on all international relations  particularly through the reducing of hot-beds of tension  the consolidation of the disarmament process and the functioning of the Security Council as it was envisaged in 1945.I have already said that a good climate does not make a good harvest unless there is good seed. What do we have on the economic side? It is clear that at the end of the twentieth century we are witnessing a unique phenomenon. We are privileged witnesses of an acceleration of history with a scope that is difficult to measure. The only certainty is that we are watching the scene being set in the theatre of the unknown that the twentieth century has always been for the authors of science fiction. The international community must set the scene  but it must take every precaution to ensure that there will not be a tragedy. In other words  the progress achieved by mankind in the political and technological areas throughout the twentieth century must not be compromised by economic distortions  which can lead only to a confrontation prejudicial to the welfare and the survival of the species.There is an urgent need for North and South to learn to march together and in harmony so that neither enters the future a step behind. That was already  we need not recall  the main objective of the First United Nations Development Decade. Since then  and at the start of the Fourth Development Decade  disappointment has reached its peak among the poor; the poorest of the poor are filled with despair  while others take refuge in shameful selfishness.It is intolerable that today  in this era of abundance and technological successes that defy the imagination  more than a billion human beings live in absolute poverty; that as many - 900 million adults and 100 million children - are illiterate; that 1.7 billion have no access to drinking water; that 800 million are hungry; that one child in three is malnourished; and that 14 million children die before the age of five.What is even more unacceptable  because it shows the failure of North-South co-operation  is that the flow of resources from developed countries to developing countries  which was positive 10 years ago  has been reversed outrageously  falling from $42.6 billion in 1980 to minus $33 billion today.The indebtedness of the developing countries in 1990 exceeds $1 300 billion  with debt servicing of $200 billion. In view of the drop in commodity prices that the developing countries have suffered in the past few years  the deterioration in the terms of trade is only becoming worse. Thus  Burkina Faso  a cotton-exporting country must today pay the equivalent of the value of 30 tons of its product to buy a tractor  as opposed to 10 tons in 1970. Because of this  any investment effort aimed at economic growth is dependent today on external assistance. We have seen that this assistance is an aberration in terms of flow of resources and is an unbearable burden in terms of dues and taxes. Moreover  it has become discriminatory and insufficient  not to say sparse.The decade of the 1930s  a lost decade for the development of our countries  has also  paradoxically  been the decade during which the concept of the quality of life has become universal. Thus  rich countries have striven to implement social policies with the ultimate aim of securing the well-being of the human person. For their part  the poor countries  while ensuring the survival of their populations  now justly demand that development have a greater qualitative content.Moreover  it seems that rich and poor have finally agreed to recognize the urgency of preserving and restoring our environment. It is to be hoped that this common heritage of mankind - endangered by the actions of the human race  and technological development principally - will be restored by the human race through the implementation of the latest techniques. The same applies to the survival of our planet and its civilisations. We must urgently orient research towards technologies that will reduce the emission of certain gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide  responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer  the development of the greenhouse effect and acid rain  whose combined effects are irreversibly altering our environment.The next United Nations Conference on the Environment  scheduled to be held in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  in 1992  will be the occasion for re-establishing a truth which seems to have been forgotten  namely  that development is indispensable for the well-being of people but at the same time it has its own limits. That applies to the environment but also  and above all  to societies whose balance is frequently threatened by economic choices favouring development/growth to the detriment of the more harmonious development which encompasses all aspects of human life.As I stressed at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  that is where our conception diverges from that of the rich countries when we speak about such important ideas as democracy and human rights. I repeat here that for us the defence of democracy and of human rights come via the promotion of a more just international economic order.In this regard  we cannot pass over in silence our partners' failure to respect the goals set by common agreement here in the General Assembly and throughout the United Nations system for international economic co-operation for development. The poor results of both the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  held from 23 March to 1 April 1990  and the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris from 3 to 14 September  are clearly signs of a lack of political will. However  we hardly need recall that our countries have agreed to huge sacrifices to restore our macro-economic balance and have adopted bold programmes to stimulate growth  despite structural disorders and the profound crisis affecting the world economy. As far as Burkina Faso is concerned  we made our own adjustments several years before we appealed to the international financial institutions. We now expect the Bretton Woods institutions and our traditional partners to give us the new resources that will provide the revivifying oxygen necessary for economic recovery and for social well-being  which are objectives of our second five-year development plan. The aim of the second plan is to consolidate the gains made in the priority sectors during the first plan  while stressing economic growth and human development.On the domestic front still  since October 1977 Comrade President Blaise Compaore and the Popular Front have been working  within the framework of the People's Democratic Revolution  to create the fundamental and real conditions in which the people itself can take on the management and direction of their affairs. The first Congress of the Popular Front called for a constitutional process  and so in 1991  there will be major electoral events in the country  enabling it to go on putting in place the political institutions in keeping with its people's requirements for social and political democracy.Our ambitions are neither out of the ordinary nor out of place. They stem from the will to survive and to integrate ourselves into the community of nations. Generally speaking  we take as our basic objectives those set by the United Nations itself. These relate inter alia  to food self-sufficiency  access to drinking water  primary health care  literacy and improving living conditions. To attain these objectives  which are the basis for all development  we are using our own territory and means; we are relying on the regional framework and South-South co-operation; and we welcome any contribution from outside our country and region consolidating the South-South co-operation effort and the North-South contract of solidarity.In general terms  we are convinced that  for the pivotal decade of the 1990s  external assistance must be in large quantity and of good quality and must take account of the particularities of the recipients. We should therefore review the aid philosophy and try to solve the problem of poor countries  indebtedness in order to inject enough new resources into their economies for there to be growth and development. Unless adequate steps are taken  we fear that the impoverishment and marginalisation of whole Nations will in time become a serious threat to international peace and security.In this respect  East-West detente  the socio-political upheavals in Eastern Europe and the integration of the whole Eastern European region into the rest of Europe  which we see beginning  are consolidating the North-South divide. The Governments represented here and they alone are responsible for seeing to it that this new division in the world does not contain within it the seed of future conflicts.Wisdom would dictate that the dividends of peace following on detente should serve peace through massive investment in development. Reason dictates that the North - that is  yesterday's East and West - should join forces to support the South in its daily struggle for survival  growth  development and a better life. The twenty-first century will  if we so desire  be the century of the greatest good for the greatest number. And is that not also democracy?"
"13",625,"BGD",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  warm felicitations are due you on your well-deserved election. This is not just a testimony to the high esteem in which the Assembly holds you; it is also a reflection of the confidence reposed in Malta by the world community. Your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  deserves our appreciation. We was firm and disciplined as well as gentle and generous. We performed his task with distinction. We has brought honour to himself and to his country  Nigeria.Tributes are also owed Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuellar. His relentless guest for peace and his tireless endeavours for development have justly won high praise.The expansion of the United Nations family attests to its credibility. We welcome Liechtenstein in our midst. We look forward to its active participation in our affairs.We meet at a complex time. It may not be the end of history  as some believe. On the contrary  we are on the threshold of a new epoch. Euphoria over the end of the cold war must not give way to complacency. Challenges and opportunities are both in prospect. These must be met and seized. The emerging scenario is not unmixed with danger for the weaker and poorer States. Our concern remains paramount that their political and economic interests be taken into account. We cannot allow them to be compromised by regional hegemonism.Doubtless great-Power rapprochement is a most positive development. We welcome it. But we must remain on guard that this is not perceived as a licence to unleash new disruptive tensions. Heady political and economic transformations are under way in Europe. These carry an immense potential for the good. The resulting peace dividends could be replicated worldwide. However  these changes can impinge on the world in yet unknown ways. These could lead resources and investments away from the developing world. These could also result in the creation of large insular economic blocs from which the weak and the poor would be excluded. There are fears that in the new world order terrorism would be more rampant. It is to be hoped that none of this will happen. We must encourage the positive counter-forces. These have called for openness  not separateness; tolerance of differing values; dialogue divorced from ideology; and co-operation based on consent. The problems of the world require a concerted response. We are becoming increasingly convinced that only the United Nations can fashion this  through co-operative management and collective security. It is possible that the aspirations of the founding fathers of the United Nations  enshrined in its Charter  will yet be realized. Together  we must work to eliminate the root cause of war  eradicate poverty  tackle indebtedness  reverse environmental degradation  fight drug abuse  and foster social progress. This may seem an ambitious agenda of high aims  but the vigour of our societies can be preserved only through the tireless pursuit of noble goals.Our hopes for a stable decade were shattered by the jolt from the current Gulf crisis. The United Nations has condemned the invasion and annexation of Kuwait. It has called upon Iraq to vacate the annexed territories and to restore the legitimate Government of Kuwait. Bangladesh is steadfastly committed to upholding the United Nations resolutions. We cannot compromise on the vital principles involved. All peace-loving nations have a major stake in preserving the sovereignty  security  political independence and territorial integrity of any State in the international community. These principles are ingrained in our Constitution. We cherish them  and hold them very dear.It was on the basis of these considerations that we sent a contingent of troops to Saudi Arabia  at the kingdom's request. Its role would be purely defensive. Our national Parliament endorsed this decision by a unanimous resolution. This step was considered to be supportive of the cause of peace and stability in the region  and of the broader interests of the Islamic community as a whole.Meanwhile  the world confronts the tormenting trauma of a vast humanitarian problem. Several hundred thousand expatriates  eager to return home  are stranded in the region. Their plight is one of the utmost misery. Bangladesh was among the first countries to urge on the United Nations system the need to activate itself in the repatriation process. This has since been developed into a remarkable triumph of orderly organization by this body. I myself travelled to Turkey and Saudi Arabia to encourage the process. The neighbouring countries  despite their acute constraints  have rendered unstinted assistance. Our gratitude to them is unbounded. Our tributes extend to the relevant United Nations agencies - in particular  to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization  the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies  the International Office of Migration  and the non-governmental organizations. I must make a special mention of the donor countries  which have provided most generous financial assistance. Much more remains to be done. The responsibilities of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan  the Secretary-General's Special Representative  will be onerous. I have no doubt he will discharge them with his usual skill and wisdom.The impact of the crisis on the global economy is great. For the fragile economies of the developing world - in particular  of the least developed countries - the consequences are disastrous. For Bangladesh  these take the form of the cost of repatriation and rehabilitation  loss of remittances  a cut-back in export earnings  the high cost of petroleum and petroleum products  and constriction of development projects. For a least-developed country like Bangladesh this is a problem of immeasurable proportions.Nevertheless  we take solace from the unity and determination of the world community to act together. The super-Powers are displaying an extraordinary cohesion. We fervently appeal to the fraternal people and Government of Iraq to heed our appeals. They must rescind their illegal annexation and resolve their original differences with Kuwait by peaceful means. Bangladesh stands committed to supporting any move in this direction. In this respect  we would welcome any meaningful initiative by the Islamic Conference and the Muslim community as a whole.The agreement between Iran and Iraq finally to settle their long-standing conflict is a development we joyously welcome. It is our hope that this will result in a durable settlement that will ultimately pave the way for stability in the region. The task of reconstruction and rehabilitation must now be the sole focus of concentration in the Gulf. This is why the recent events in the area are all the more saddening.With regard to the Middle Eastern region  we are alarmed by Israel's increased intransigence. The prevalent unstable situation is rendered more dangerous by Israel's negative posture on any move to find a just and durable solution to the issue of Palestine. Let me unequivocally declare that Bangladesh's commitment to the Palestinian cause is unflinching. We condemn Israel's provocative action in settling Jewish immigrants in the occupied territories. We consider reprehensible their atrocious repression of the glorious intifadah. Israel's control of the West Bank  Gaza and the Golan Heights clearly rest on force  and must cease. Israel must withdraw from all territories illegally occupied since 1967. The inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including a State of their own with Jerusalem as its capital  must be restored. In this connection  we reaffirm our call for the early convening of an international peace conference with the participation of all States  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  on an equal footing.Despite significant advances towards a political solution  the Afghans continue to suffer. Millions of refugees are yet to return home in safety and honour. The continued induction of weaponry into the area and civil strife have retarded the immense task of rehabilitation and reconstruction. Settlement of the problem calls also for a truly representative broad-based Government reflecting the popular will. The Afghan people must determine their own destiny. They must be able to choose their own Government without any outside intervention or interference. We must ensure the preservation of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of Afghanistan  and its non-aligned and Islamic character.On Cambodia  we hail the agreement just reached. The Cambodian people have suffered too long  too painfully. We are fully aware  however  that despite this historic step many obstacles remain and must be overcome. Our commitment to a solution does not lie in words alone. From the outset Bangladesh has offered to support the United Nations peace efforts in tangible terms through the contribution of civilian and military personnel. I firmly reiterate this offer today.In our own region - South Asia - the escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India concern us deeply. I urge the leaders of the two countries to exercise maximum restraint. I hope the process of constructive dialogue  recently initiated  can have positive results. Bangladesh remains committed to developing close ties with all our neighbours on the basis of justice  equality  mutual benefit and respect for international law. We have great confidence in the viability of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation. Four consecutive summits have testified to the success of that organization in fulfilling its socio-economic mandate. It has also acted as a harmonizing political force. We look forward to the fifth summit  scheduled to be held in the Maldives in November this year.In divided Cyprus  despite intensification of the search for a solution between the leaders of the Greek and Cypriot communities  an overall settlement has proved elusive. However  possible options for resolution have emerged that could safeguard the legitimate interests and could meet the concerns of both communities. These merit close examination. Our hope is that ultimately they will come to fruition. Similarly  it is our fervent hope that the renewed contacts and recent initiatives between the two Koreas will lead to reconciliation and an acceptable solution. We support the United Nations role in Central America promoting the practical realization of the various agreements reached. In particular  the United Nations efforts in organizing and monitoring the implementation of those agreements deserves praise. We are encouraged by the leadership in the quest for peace provided by the Heads of State and of Government of the region.In Africa too  there is discernible forward movement  of which Western Sahara is an example. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is actively involved there with United Nations support. Institutionalized co-operation among the Maghreb countries is a hopeful sign that the issue may finally be resolved.Epoch-making changes are also taking place in southern Africa. The independence of Namibia  the release of Nelson Mandela  the lifting of the state of emergency and the promise of reforms by President De Klerk are welcome; yet  the daily blood-letting in that unfortunate land is a painful reminder of South Africa's woes. Apartheid is yet to be dismantled. Our struggle  and the active involvement of the United Nations  must continue until such time as South Africa transforms itself into a democratic  multiracial State.In the world today  no region  no country and no people is too far away. Our hearts go out to the Liberians in their suffering. The world must do more to alleviate their miseries. We must make all efforts to bring about peace in the troubled country.We are heartened by the recent successes in the areas of arms control and disarmament; we would mention the super-Power agreements in particular. However  we must bear in mind that weapons and conflicts feed one another. Guns will proliferate if the need for them exists. Therefore  disarmament cannot truly succeed unless we resolutely alter the current global milieu. Time and again  Bangladesh has stressed its commitment to general and complete disarmament. Peace dividends must be devoted to development. Our position is evident in our conviction that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is vital to the maintenance of global peace and security. We would call upon the nuclear-weapon States to enter into substantive negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Also  they must assure and strengthen positive and also negative security guarantees against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. We highlighted our concerns about these issues at the recent Fourth NPT Review Conference. We believe that sufficient groundwork has been laid for our efforts to achieve these fundamental goals before the 1995 review and extension conference.We consider the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and of zones of peace to be amongst the measures which are integral to a non-proliferation regime. There is also an urgent need to address conventional disarmament. Competition among neighbours in this can have  indeed has had  disastrous consequences. The work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean must resume  with all States participating. We must concentrate on holding the conference in Colombo as soon as possible.Recent events have poignantly demonstrated that the roots of conflict most often lie in economic causes. Over past years  there has been growing anxiety about the decline in the course of development. Substantive factors and attitudes combined to aggravate the situation· Mutual accusations and sterile debate between the developed and the developing world led to stagnation and even to deterioration in the situation in the latter. The economic and technological gap between the rich and the poor countries widened. Many developing countries tried to follow the prescription for structural adjustment  at great cost and with great hardship. Collapsing commodity price structures  volatile exchange rates  the shrinkage of aid in real terms  growing indebtedness and diminishing purchasing power threaten to suffocate the developing economies. Against this backdrop  we welcome the results of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  which forged a new global consensus on ways to promote meaningful co-operation. There are substantial opportunities to spell out the elements of this consensus in formulating the International Development Strategy for the current decade  to be adopted by the General Assembly this session.The results of the recently held Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries will be a key supplementary factor. The outcome of the Conference  though falling short of expectations  was in many ways a success. Here I must commend the very positive role played by President Mitterrand and his great country  France. On the critical issues of increased resource flows  external debt  market access for least-developed-country (LDC) products  and commodity-related questions  some progress was achieved. There must now be all-out efforts  both on the part of the donors and by the LDCs  fully to implement the new plan of action. Given the current turbulence in the international scene and the dire impact on that scene of the Gulf crisis  the development of the LDCs will remain an uphill task. Consequently  focus on their problems must be sharpened.We look forward with keen anticipation to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Bangladesh is actively participating in the preparatory process  which is under way. The Conference must produce results that will assist countries  particularly in the developing world  to meet their obligations. We hope the proposed conventions on climate change and on the protection of biodiversity will soon be ready for signature.A mainstay of the consolidation of global peace  development and security is the effort to strengthen the rule of international law. I attach special significance  therefore  to the proclamation of the 1990s as United Nations Decade of International Law. Priority must be accorded to strengthening the world law-of-the-sea order  the completion of provisions governing non-navigational uses of international watercourses  and to formulating a legal regime for the environment.Of paramount importance  in the final analysis  is the enhancement of human worth. The rules that constitute the corpus of human rights must be given meaningful definitions. Human rights are inseparably enmeshed with the right to development. Today  a billion people barely survive on the margin of existence. They cannot be  must not be  denied their most basic  most fundamental right  the right to a decent life. We must ensure that right in this  the last decade of this present millennium. Their journey into the next century must be led by a beacon of hope.In this  the United Nations can  and indeed must  be of assistance. In this forum  let us adopt some resolutions unanimously. Let us resolve to face the future together  in friendship and fraternity. Let us harmonize the dictates of individual national interests with those of global needs. Let us balance the imperatives of self-reliance with those of collective endeavour. Let us strengthen global security so as to face together the dangers that may imperil us. Let us work together in earnest to resolve our differences  so that these in the end do not defeat us.This is our common dream. It is also one that  should we so desire  can be turned into a reality."
"14",671,"BGR",45,1990,"﻿Please accept my sincere congratulations  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish you success and express my conviction that your able guidance will contribute significantly to the successful outcome of our work.I should also like to thank Mr. Joseph Garba  President of the last session for his personal contribution to its efficient and fruitful work.I take this opportunity to extend my greetings to the Secretary-General Mr. Peres de Cuellar  and to express our appreciation of  and high esteem for his efforts aimed at the achievement of tangible results from United Nations activities for the enhancement of its international prestige.On behalf of my country  I should like whole-heartedly to welcome to the family of nations the Republic of Namibia and the Principality of Liechtenstein  whose accession to membership in the United Nations is yet another step towards the consolidation of our Organisation's universal character. It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to address this forum as the freely elected President of new and democratic Bulgaria  an honour because this event  at this historic moment  marks the return  well overdue  of a small and long-suffering nation to the community of free nations and sovereign democracies.The current forty-fifth session is taking place in conditions of radical change in the world. We are witnessing a transition towards a new state of international relations. Rivalry and confrontation are giving way to dialogue and co-operation  to mutual understanding and reasonable compromise. There have been numerous manifestations of this trend lately. Noteworthy among the  is the growing frequency of the summit meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union  the recent declarations of the countries of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)  the constructive spirit of the all-European process in all its dimensions and the positive results of the efforts to resolve regional conflicts.What 1990 will be remembered for are the democratic revolutions in Eastern European this has indeed been the year of Eastern Europe. Hungary  East Germany  and Czechoslovakia abandoned their Communist system and entered on the road of democracy. My own country  too  has a place in this process. Albeit slower than others  Bulgaria is also undergoing deep democratic changes which irreversibly break it away from communism.There does however appear to exist a prejudiced view that changes in Bulgaria are sporadic or at least not as thorough as in some other States. I should  therefore  like to outline to this prestigious international forum my nation's struggle for freedom and democracy. The fight against the communist system started during the regime of Todor Zhivkov. Two years before the dictator's fall from power there emerged independent associations championing human rights  ecological issues  associations of intellectuals and so forth. The regime's attempts to quell or discredit them proved futile. These independent associations were the first forms of organised opposition against the totalitarian Communist system.Todor Zhivkov's fall from power on 10 November 1989 brought about the start of a new stage in the development of the democratic opposition in Bulgaria and of the democratic process in general. The Union of Democratic Forces  which now unites 15 political parties and organisations  was established only a month later. I should like to emphasise  though  that many former members of the Communist Party have also joined the Union of Democratic Forces. The establishment of the Union of Democratic Forces uniting the main opposition parties and organisations has turned the opposition into a major political force which the ruling party had to reckon with. The scores of mass anti-Communist rallies organised by the Union of Democratic Forces in towns and villages during the winter and spring of 1990 broke the ice of fear. The people raised their voice demanding  ""Down with communism”. After taking over the country's streets and squares  the opposition forced the Communist Parliament to revoke article 1 of the Constitution which had guaranteed the Communist Party's leading role.As a result of the popular pressure  the opposition forced the authorities to agree to hold the round-table negotiations on some of the most important aspects of the country's political system. These negotiations went on for nearly three months. They were broadcast live on radio and television and ultimately served as a true political school for the nation. Ordinary people  particularly those living outside the capital  saw for the first time that there was nothing dangerous in criticising and condemning the community Party deified by the totalitarian regime. They saw that those responsible for the crisis could be brought to justice and that the Party could be urged to step down.The successful development of the democratic process caused a deep crisis in the Bulgarian Communist Party. Within it emerged forces aware of the need for internal reform. That Party changed its name from Communist to Socialist and took some steps to democratise its structures. I should note  however  that the course of the democratisation in Bulgaria will continue to depend upon the complicated and contradictory processes currently under way in the Bulgarian Socialist Party. There can be no doubt that parliamentary democracy in the country will be strengthened if that Party manages to transfer  into a modern leftist Western style party.In the round-table negotiations  the opposition forced the holding of elections for a Grand national Assembly  a constituent parliament called upon to adopt a democratic constitution and to pass legislation guaranteeing the success of the reforms in the political and economic spheres. Last June  the opposition carried 37 per cent of the vote at the first multi-party elections in Bulgaria in the last 50 years. Together with the Bulgarian Agrarian Party  a smaller opposition organisation  it now controls 40 per cent of the seats in Parliament.Many believe that the distribution of seats in the National Assembly does not reflect the actual balance of the political forces in the country. The fact that the young people  the intellectuals and the people in the big cities  including the capital  voted for the opposition indicates that it is backed by the most active part of the population. A Provisional Municipal Councils Act bas bean passed recently aimed at dismantling the totalitarian structures at the level of municipalities and guaranteeing the participation of all political forces in local self-government. Thus  the forthcoming local government elections will be hold under equal conditions for all participants.Currently a bill is being debated on the de-politicisation of the army  police  security agencies  the courts of law  the state prosecutor's offices and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Under the provisions of the bill  people employed by those institutions would not be allowed membership in political parties and would be prohibited from organising political activity in favour of any party. This law would be of extreme importance for the complete dismantling of the Communist totalitarian system since it would destroy its backbone  which is the merger of the Communist Party apparatus with that of the State. The Bulgarian Parliament is also expected to pass a privatisation act; a land law that would return to its owners the land forcibly taken from then during the Stalinist collectivisation drive; laws on property  banking and trade; and numerous other laws  mere limited in scope  that should provide the legal basis for our society's transition from a centralized State-run economy to a genuine market economy.The first  and immediate  step on the road to economic reform will be the dismantling of the State monopoly in all spheres of economic life  without which privatization and agrarian reform would be quite impossible. The guarantees for the implementation of this far-reaching programmes are: first  the awakening of a nation that desires to live in the conditions of democracy and of a market economy that releases people's energy and individual initiative; and secondly  the will and energy of the democratic opposition in Parliament  which is fuelling the democratic process and is putting forward initiatives to prevent this process from being halted.In this brief sketch of my country  I must again emphasise that Bulgaria now has a multiparty system; a democratically elected Parliament; an opposition that controls 40 per cent of parliamentary seats and has won the political initiative; free press  radio and television; and political pluralism in the spiritual sphere. In other words  we have an awakening civil society that is eagerly moving towards democracy.This gives me sufficient grounds for concluding that Bulgaria is no longer a Communist or totalitarian State. But neither is it a fully democratic country  inasmuch as it still has not adopted a new Constitution and has not been able to base its economy on free-market principles. Bulgaria is currently in a state of transition from totalitarian rule to democracy - that peculiar transitional state that some refer to as post-totalitarian. The processes  however  are irreversible  and the building of a fully democratic State  with a democratic Constitution  democratic institutions and a market economy  is only a matter of time.The deep democratic changes that have taken place in less than a year - changes that I mentioned earlier - could not fail to leave their imprint on Bulgaria's foreign policy  could not but lead to changes in its principles  aims and priorities.We have categorically rejected the doctrine of limited sovereignty  known as the Brezhnev doctrine  since it infringes our national independence and violates the Bulgarian's national dignity and national pride. We have also discarded the so-called principle of socialist internationalism  which is nothing but an ill-concealed means of subjugating our foreign policy to that of other States. We have abandoned the principle by which the country's entire foreign policy was designed to serve the interests and ideology of a single party enjoying a monopoly of power.In place of the principles that have been rejected  we have adopted new ones that meet the interests of a democratic State. Thus Bulgaria has restored the principle of full national independence and unrestricted sovereignty  which enables us to direct our own foreign policy. The interests of the State and the nation as a whole have taken the place of the principle of one-party domination. No party can now place its own interests above those of the nation.The principle of realism and pragmatism has become an important one in our new foreign policy. Pragmatism  naturally  does not imply egotism with respect to other States  nor does it imply gaining advantage for one's own nation at the expense of others. On the contrary  we are well aware that political pragmatism is feasible only in strict compliance with established international norms  only if the interests of other countries and peoples  no matter how close or remote they must respected and protected.That is why Bulgaria has so firmly supported the resolutions of the Security Council in connection with Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and is strictly observing the embargo imposed against the aggressor. Bulgaria is probably the European country hardest hit by the Gulf crisis. The blow is made even more painful  having occurred at a time when the country is undergoing far-reaching economic reforms. Production is drooping  and there is an acute shortage of goods  raw materials and energy. These factors are accelerating inflationary processes and increasing unemployment.Regardless of the wants and hardships that the Bulgarian people are forced to bear  we shall continue to condemn the Iraqi aggression. We shall continue to demand the return of Kuwait's legitimate Government and shall continue strictly to observe the embargo. We are doing this in accordance with our own convictions  not because we are forced to. I believe that Bulgaria's reaction to the Persian Gulf crisis has demonstrated in practical terms ay country's return to the international community as a civilised member.The unanimity with which the United Nations condemned the aggression against a small and defenceless nation is truly moving. It is indeed encouraging to see countries such as the United States  the Soviet Union  France  the United Kingdom  Germany  and others  joining together against the aggressor. In the conduct of the world Organisation with respect to this crisis we see the archetype of future global guarantees for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all small States  as well as the return of the United Nations to its main objectives and its fundamental role.  However  so long as all this is still in the future - while it has yet to become reality - my country is compelled to seek guarantees for its national independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty. This problem in assuming particular importance now  at a time when the old system of military alliances and imperial relations is disintegrating and a new system has not yet been built  at present the guarantees for Bulgaria's territorial integrity stem from the Warsaw Treaty and our bilateral agreement with the Soviet Union. But things are changing fast.Given that all political realities are in a process of rapid change  our only reliable security for the future lies in faithful adherence to the principles of our foreign policy  whose new priorities ate  directly from those principles.First among these priorities is the desire to maintain good - if possible  friendly - relations with our neighbours  relations based on mutual respect for each other's interests  recognition of the territorial integrity of all countries in the region  and the promotion of economic and cultural ties with each of those countries on the basis of mutual advantage.I should like to emphasise in particular my country's readiness to contribute to the improvement of the situation in the Balkans. We are firmly committed to putting an end to the crisis in Bulgarian-Turkish relations. I am convinced that the time has come to terminate this last cold war in Europe. At the seats time  I should I like to underline that our willingness to reach mutual understanding with Turkey does not mean that we have any intention of abandoning the increasing closeness developing between us and other Balkan neighbours. In other words  let us Europeanise the Balkans  rather than Balkanising Europe.A second priority in Bulgaria's foreign policy is its opening-up to the world by eliminating all economic and political barriers inherited from the old regime. Without this opening-up we should be unable to obtain the new and modern technologies and the investment that are seeded from the successful transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy.A priority for Bulgaria is membership of the united Europe of the future and the comprehensive development of our relations with the United States and all other industrialised nations. This means broad participation by my country in the global integration processes. In this respect we are intensifying our ties with all international organisations and are taking an ever-more-active part in their work. Initially  we are trying to be more active and flexible within the framework of the Helsinki process with a view to its institutionalisation as an international mechanism for consultation and co-operation.A fourth priority is the reassessment of our country's performance at the United Nations  an organisation that we will continue to support. It is our view that the Organisation can further enhance its role in our world both in protecting the national interests of its Member States and in safeguarding world peace in general.As a fifth priority  I should like to point out the adaptation of our national legislation and new Constitution to the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child  to mention only a few.Bulgaria has already undertaken important steps to guarantee the rights and freedoms o£ all Bulgarian citizens regardless of their religious and ethnic affiliation  to bring our legislation into line with international standards in this sphere in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Significant amendments have been made to the Foreign Travel Passports Act  the Law on Bulgarian Citizenship and the Law on Foreign Nationals Stay in the People's Republic of Bulgaria.As of tomorrow  Germany will again be a united State. From this important rostrum and on behalf of the Bulgarian nation I extend our warmest and sincere congratulations to the German nation  with which we have maintained close ties throughout our history. I en convinced that a united  democratic and prospering Germany will promote stability and international co-operation in Europe and the world. Finally  I wish once again to reiterate that I believe the world should know about Bulgaria; my country has embarked irreversibly upon the road to modem democracy and a market-oriented economy. I express the hope of all Bulgarians that the new Bulgaria will earn its place in the community of nations united by the values of freedom  democracy and peace."
"15",716,"BHR",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  allow me  at the outset of my statement  to present my sincere congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  and to pay tribute to your friendly country  Malta. In wishing you success in conducting the proceedings of this session  we assure you of our readiness to co-operate with you in the furtherance of the common goals which our Organisation is striving to achieve.I would also like  on behalf of the delegation of my country  to express our thanks to Mr. Joseph Garba for his skill in conducting the proceedings of the Assembly during his presidency over the previous session  as well as the special sessions held in-between  for his distinguished efforts in the interest of the United Nations.I avail myself of this opportunity to express the greatest appreciation to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his tireless efforts to enhance the role of the Organization in strengthening security and maintaining peace in the world.It is also ray pleasure to extend  once again  to the chairman and members of the delegation of the Republic of Namibia the congratulations of the State of Bahrain on the accession of their country to the United Nations. We regard this as an historic accomplishment by any standard  a true expression of the will of the Namibian people who  after long years of struggle and perseverance  have attained their independence. This is a victory for international legitimacy  as represented by the United Nations. We are confident that independent Namibia will assume its role in supporting the just causes in the world.Similarly  I would like to express  on behalf of my country  Bahrain  our sincere congratulations to the Principality of Liechtenstein on the occasion of its accession to the Organisation. We are sure that it will contribute to the achievement of the objectives and purposes of the United Nations.The forty-fifth session is convening as the United Nations is witnessing an important period in its history  one of transition from the cold war era to an era of détente as a result of a novel and innovative vision that seeks to carry ideological differences and rivalry of interests to a new level of international co-operation that is based on an enlightened dialogue and a clear understanding of world issues.This detente undoubtedly represents the return of relations between nations to their correct course  guided by a political philosophy rooted in adherence to the principles and objectives of the Charter  which the founders of the United Nations had long hoped would constitute the approach to peace in the world and the framework for the security of all mankind.In the midst of their positive orientation towards a new world order came the Iraqi invasion of the territory of the sister State of Kuwait on 2 August to test the mettle of international detente and underscore the fact that  unless there is a concerted international effort to establish an effective security system in the world  this new philosophy will collapse. We agree with the statement in the Secretary-General's report that the world is in dire need of ""a coherent strategy of peace"" and that it is important to emphasise the comprehensive nature of the concept of peace  as laid down in the Charter. However  we do not view peace as a necessity imposed by events and developments or dictated by pressures and influences  but as an approach to the formulation of relations between peoples on a basis of equality and justice so as to preserve the legitimate rights and interests of all parties  guarantee their stability and safety and permit them to direct their energies towards meeting the requirements of construction and rehabilitation. It is also a framework for settling differences and disputes through dialogue and accommodation  an essential requirement of collective life  whether in the past  present or future. Such a peace is a choice that genuinely reflects the aspirations and hopes of our peoples.The Iraqi invasion of the State of Kuwait  that small country noted for its positive interaction with world issues  has deeply wounded the conscience of humanity and caused a huge fissure in the wall of international security. It has also placed world peace atop an erupting volcano at a time when the world thought it had reached an acceptable degree of consensus on the formulation of a common regional and international policy  capable of comprehending and absorbing the détente movement in our new world  as well as a reasonable measure of agreement on the importance of resolving hot regional conflicts through dialogue and by peaceful means.The world was surprised when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait  that peaceful and pacifist country which was bound to Iraq by the strongest and deepest of fraternal relations and shared with it membership in the League of Arab States  the United Nations and several other regional and international organisations  only to be repaid for its noble postures by the victimisation and dispersion of its people. The Iraqi invasion has caused a severe trauma to Kuwaiti society and total upheaval in Kuwait's public life. Business activity has ground to a halt  institutions have been demolished  properties have been seized and all financial and economic activities completely paralysed. Hundreds of thousands of Kuwaitis and aliens residing in Kuwait fled the country in fear and dread of the pilfering  looting  sabotage  assaults  killings and destruction perpetrated by the Iraqi forces  not to mention the raiding of homes and the shooting of innocent unarmed civilians who refused to collaborate with the occupation forces. This amounted to an attempt to destroy the very foundations of the State  obliterate the identity of its people and erase it from the map of the world for all time. In this respect  we cannot overlook the plight of the thousands of foreign nationals displaced from the State of Kuwait and the detention of some of them as hostages to serve as human shields without regard to moral principles or human values.This crisis has placed the United Nations at the forefront of events. The Security Council was quick to act  adopting eight resolutions so far  all demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and the restoration of the legitimate Government of the country. The common will of the States of the world was reflected in resolution 665 (1990)  which expressed the insistence of the international community that economic sanctions be imposed against Iraq by every possible means.Bahrain's position  vis-à-vis the Iraqi aggression is clear and unequivocal. Iraqi forces must withdraw unconditionally from Kuwaiti territory  no recognition of Iraq's annexation of Kuwait nor of any consequences thereof  but insistence on the restitution of the legitimate Government that had existed in Kuwait prior to the invasion as represented in the person of His Highness Sheikh Jaber AI-Ahmad Al-Sabah  the Emir of the State of Kuwait; the rights of civilians in the Iraqi-occupied territory of Kuwait should be respected  their safety guaranteed and their lives and properties protected  in accordance with the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949  in addition to the demand that the Iraqi authorities refrain from effecting any changes in the demographic composition within Kuwait which would constitute a violation of international laws affirming the legal right of all injured Kuwaitis and others to receive fair indemnity for damages and losses incurred by them; and considering as null and void Iraq's decision on the closure of diplomatic and consular missions accredited to the State of Kuwait. We call upon Iraq to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council and to respond to the international community's unanimity with a view to preserving international legitimacy.The acute crisis created by Iraq has caused a basic disruption in the regional security system of the Gulf  constituting as it has a blatant breach of the principles of the United Nations  of all international norms and covenants and of the provisions of international law and fundamental human rights.Since its inception  the Gulf Co-operation Council has worked consistently on co-ordinating political and economic ties between its members  developing the indigenous capabilities of their peoples and proceeding forward on the road to laying the foundations of co-operation between its member States  with the aim of developing positive attitudes on achieving security and stability in the Gulf  in co-operation with all States in the region through understanding and dialogue  as well as respect for the principles of good-neighbourliness  territorial sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. However  the security challenges posed by the Iraqi invasion make it imperative for us to reconsider the question of the security of the Gulf in   new context  that would be compatible with the requirements of the era of detente and ensure the protection of regional and international interests. In this respect  I would like to refer in particular to the need to adopt the necessary international Measures in times of crises  especially those prescribed in Chapter VII of the Charter  which call for the application of measures agreed to by the members of the Security Council in cases where there exists a threat to or breach of peace or act of aggression against any State Member of the United Nations. The widespread condemnation of the Iraqi invasion of the sister State of Kuwait has proved that it is possible to apply the system of collective security in the post-cold war era  especially after the Soviet Union and the United States had agreed on the way to deal with regional crises. The Security Council has been able to adopt the wise and apt resolution 660 (1990) in which it demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Iraq of all its forces to the positions in which they were deployed on 1 August 19S0. Faced with the failure of the Iraqi authorities to comply with that resolution  the Council did not hesitate to adopt its historic resolution 661 (1990) imposing economic sanctions against Iraq and more recently  resolution 670 (1990) strengthening the blockade imposed against Iraq.The international community  which had suffered immensely fro  the effects of the cold war and its negative effects over the past four decades  cannot permit any contravention of international legitimacy in this phase of trust detente which the world is experiencing now. Iraq's occupation of the State of Kuwait was the first serious test of the new international order  since it represented a departure from the general atmosphere of defeat  which stresses dialogue and understanding in resolving international problems and emphasises a balance of interests rather than a balance of power. The States that had already begun reorganising their affairs within the framework of this new international order were not ready to allow a regional Power to depart from these rules. This explains  perhaps  why international unanimity against Iraq crystallised so quickly and why the Security Council adopted such crucial resolutions to confront the crisis and its serious ramifications. There can be no doubt that the 9 September 1990 Helsinki summit between Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev was an important milestones on the road towards the laying of the foundations of a new international order that is based on respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. We fully support the joint statement of the Helsinki summit  which reiterated several fundamental principles  among the most important of which is that no peaceful international order is possible if larger States are permitted to devour their smaller neighbours.It may be appropriate now to pause to consider a few points of special importance to my delegation by virtue of their relevance to regional security and their impact on our vision of the future of the region in which we live and the Arab nation to which we belong.The first point relates to our absolute rejection - which I reiterate - of the logic of occupation by force of the territory of others or the invasion of one State by another and its annexation under threat of the use of arms. The starting point to deal with this subject in all its dangerous and complicated dimensions is that we must not hesitate to tackle it. Nor must we be satisfied with voicing protests that are devoid of content and do not produce results. For if we do so we shall be contributing  intentionally or unintentionally  to the aggravation of the damage to international legitimacy. Our clear ain should be to prevent developments from jeopardising peace and security in the Gulf region and to insist on the implementation of Security Council resolutions in letter and in spirit.The second point relates to the importance of emphasising the right of any State to adopt all legitimate measures of self-defence and safeguard the security and safety of its citizens  in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter  which deals with legitimate self-defence. In that contest  we laud the alacrity of the sister and friendly States - totalling more than 22 from Africa  Asia  Australia  Europe  North America and South America - in responding to the invitation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to join it in the defence of its territory  and in responding to the behests of international legitimacy with determination and firmness in order to deter aggression and preserve peace in the Gulf region.The third point relates to our conviction that the Middle East must be made a zone free of weapons of mass destruction  namely nuclear  chemical and biological weapons. The achievement of that goal will be a step forward towards safeguarding the future of peace-loving States in the region and removing the spectre of the nuclear and chemical threat under which they live. This is a requirement that stems from the legitimate right of those States to self-defence and to deter any attempt to violate their inalienable rights. It is also in keeping with the concepts  values and trends of our age.There are several political  economic and social issues on which our attention and that of the world is focused. Foremost among them is the question of the Palestinian people and the various kinds of suppression and terror used by the Israeli occupying authorities against the intifadah. It is therefore imperative that a just and comprehensive settlement of the question of Palestine be achieved through the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 43 176 of 15 December 1988 and 44 42 of 6 December 1989  with the participation of all the parties concerned and of the permanent members of the Security Council  in order to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and to the establishment of a State of their own on their national soil. The conference should also stress the need for the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the occupied Arab territories  including southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan Heights.As regards Lebanon  it was gratifying to see the parties concerned in this crisis agreeing to the Taif accord which represents a basic foundation for national unity. We welcome the Lebanese Parliament's ratification in August 1990 of that important instrument  and hail it as a historic step towards the implementation of all phases of the accord  the restoration of Lebanon's unity and the preservation of its independence and sovereignty.The world is united in stating that racial discrimination and the policy of apartheid are a blatant violation of human principles and the dignity of mankind  and contravene the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On 14 December 1989  the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session  adopted by consensus the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa  which sets out principles that can be acceptable points for the elimination of apartheid in South Africa.As regards the Cyprus problem  we hope progress can be achieved in the dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General  so that the unity of Cyprus can be restored.The Korean question also occupies the attention of the international community today owing to positive developments on the political level in the two Koreas. We reiterate our support for all efforts aimed at reuniting the two parts of the Korean peninsula and at realising the hopes of the Korean people through the accomplishment of national unity. The political charges in the world today  notably the policy of detente between the two super-Powers and the tendency of the majority of States to abide by the provisions of the Charter and the principles of international law have not been reflected in an improvement of the deteriorating economic situation of the developing countries  which continue to suffer from the excruciating economic crises that are the legacy of the 1970s and 1980s. Perhaps the debt crisis  the negative effects of which the world began to suffer in the early 1980s  is the most striking of the problems that developing countries have been facing of late  since it has led to economic recession and in the inability of a number of those countries to meet their financial obligations. There are indications that the adverse effects of the deteriorating economic conditions in the developing countries will not be limited to those countries  but will spill over and affect the developed countries as well.It is our sincere hope that international co-operation can be strengthened in order to settle this indebtedness within the framework of the United Nations. We hope too that the obligations set out in the economic declaration of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalisation of economic growth and development of the developing countries  will be duly honoured and implemented in isolation from political differences. We also hope for success in efforts to secure the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. Since the founding of the United Nations  this Hall has witnessed numerous debates and discussions on the problems  crises and dangers that beset the world. Those debates and discussions were held in the hope of securing the support of the United Nations in resolving them  and containing their causes. Our viewpoints on those issues sometimes converged but  more often than not  diverged.The reason we are now hopeful and optimistic is that the current session of the General Assembly is convened at a time when the world is experiencing the easing of tension with regard to a number of international issues and an important transformation in the functions of the United Nations  the trustworthy custodian of the world's interests and a major partner in facing up to the dangers that confront it. This puts our Organization back on track  for the role prescribed for it by its Charter is that of a centre for co-ordinating the actions of nations and a vehicle for adopting the important decisions required for the preservation of international legitimacy and respect for the provisions of international law and the principles of justice  with all that this requires in clarity of thought and flexibility of action.We look forward to the day when this living edifice for peace which the authors of the Charter envisioned is completed  so that it may proceed with sure steps towards achieving affluence and prosperity for all the peoples of the world."
"16",754,"BHS",45,1990,"﻿I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Given your experience and political skills  we are confident that the affairs of this Assembly will come to a successful conclusion under your wise leadership. May I take this opportunity to express my appreciation and congratulations to your predecessor  Ambassador Joseph Garba of Nigeria  who was exemplary in his conduct of the affairs of the General Assembly.I also wish on behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas warmly to welcome Namibia and the Principality of Liechtenstein to membership in the United Nations. I also extend our heartfelt congratulations to Germany on its reunification. Our hope for a more enduring world peace has been challenged by Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The Bahamas urges all nations involved to exhaust every effort to resolve this situation without further violence. Central to international relations are the prohibition of the threat or use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. These are principles which small States  such as the Bahamas  hold dear. Hence  the Bahamas joined the world community in denouncing the invasion and occupation of Kuwait  and in calling for the immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi troops and the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait. The Bahamas has endorsed all action taken by the Security Council in this regard and  in particular  it has undertaken to uphold the sanctions imposed under Security Council resolutions until they achieve their desired results.A comprehensive peace in the Middle East is urgently needed. Therefore  we support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and involving all parties to the conflict. We urge those directly concerned to create conditions that would ensure the success of such s conference. He again reiterate our full support for Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised borders  and reaffirm our commitment to the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.Continuing violence and dissension lead us to conclude that the pillars of apartheid remain intact. The opportunity presented by the conclusion of the Pretoria Minute between the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and all efforts to remove obstacles to negotiations for a democratic  non-racial South Africa must be energetically pursued.It is in this context that the Bahamas welcomed the consensus adoption by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session of the Declaration on South Africa  which is drafted in full compliance with international principles. It ought not be that we adhere to these principles sometimes  disregard them at other times and shun them in favour of yet other principles at other times. Sanctions should not be lifted until there is real and irreversible movement towards the abolition of apartheid in South Africa. These conditions have not been met. The Bahamas  therefore  continues to support sanctions  and urges the international community also to maintain and renew its resolve.The experience in Namibia clearly indicated that change is possible  even in seemingly intractable situations. We have witnessed what could be accomplished by a people's drive for self-determination  when supported by the commitment of the international community  The Bahamas would now wish to see a commitment to the process of peace and democracy demonstrated to the fullest extent in Haiti.The Government and the people of Haiti have made clear their desire to move their country forward on the road to democracy and development. The Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  meeting recently in Jamaica  once again took note of this encouraging position  and reiterated their unequivocal commitment to the goals and objectives which Haiti had set for itself.We believe that the United Nations must also be actively involved in Haiti's quest for democracy  and we are confident that the Organisation will overcome attendant difficulties and respond favourably to Haiti's request for security and other assistance in the holding of elections.We must envision more for Haiti. In keeping with the decision of the Heads of CARICOM  the Bahamas would urge the convening of an international conference on the reconstruction of Haiti  following successful democratic elections in that country. We believe that an effective solution to this situation will greatly facilitate the maintenance of peace and stability in the entire Caribbean region. We are pleased that the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances will come into force in November of this year. The Bahamas stands ready to join other States parties to the Convention in the strict implementation of its provisions. We consider that action taken by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders  specifically in the area of organised crime  and the adoption of model legislation in areas including extradition  will greatly facilitate the process of implementing of many of the provisions of the Convention.Startling and dramatic events in Latin America last year considerably elevated the search for solutions to the illicit drug problem. This year has been one of urgent and intense international activity  aimed at devising new strategies to counteract the drug problem. At the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly  convened in February of this year  the commitment to fight the scourge of drug abuse was affirmed at the highest political level  as demonstrated by the adoption by consensus of a political Declaration and a global programme of action. To our satisfaction  it has been widely recognised that measures to reduce demand must not be neglected and must be given equal emphasis with production and trafficking.The international community took the opportunity to review  at the level of experts  the capacity of the United Nations to lead the fight against drug abuse and illicit trafficking and to arrive at a better understanding of the complex illicit drug trade. Indeed  the Bahamas already has in place strong regulations and laws aimed at counteracting money laundering and at forfeiture of the proceeds of drug crimes. We are convinced that  with adequate safeguards to protect legitimate international banking  we can deprive international drug cartels of the proceeds of their evil trade  and destroy their sole purpose for existing. Does the political will exist to halt and reverse the deadly affects of drug abuse on our societies and to stem the violence it engenders? The answer must be ""Yes”.At the national level  the Bahamas follows a comprehensive strategy encompassing interdiction efforts  prevention  public information  severe sanctions for drug offenders and compulsory testing for security forces. Our co-operation with other States at the bilateral and multilateral levels  particularly in operational activities  has been widely recognised as being exemplary.Consequently  the traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into and through the Bahamas has been drastically decreased  and there has been a slowing  though not a halt  of drug abuse by Bahamians. We will continue to take vigorous national action  and will join in international initiatives to make drug control more effective. The first year of the final decade of the twentieth century is ending with signs of both hope end disillusionment. The rise in the price of energy  the massive increase in external-debt servicing and the loss of or reduction in foreign-exchange earnings have all combined to sake the 1980s a lost decade for development. The United Nations and individual Member countries should pay increasing attention to reversing that trend.Indeed  in the Bahamas we work even harder in traditional economic sectors such as tourism and banking. He follow the axiom that we must do better what we know how to do well. He must make our good better and our better best. That has certainly been our experience in tourism and financial services.At the same time  we continue to exploit every window of opportunity for diversification  restructuring and investment. Ws seek investment not only in agriculture  fisheries and tourism  but also in the sophisticated service and light industrial sectors with high employment and export and import-substitution potential.Political  social and economic stability is a critical element in maintaining confidence and hence in stimulating investment and output. But stability alone is not sufficient. The challenge is to shift our emphasis to the economic and social well-being of moat of the planet and to keep it on a path of sustainable growth. I have therefore instructed my delegation to focus store on economic development and investment promotion and on reorienting the Organisation to deal afresh and more effectively with the economic issues I have mentioned.Because of important linkages with the economies of the United States of America  Canada  Japan and an integrated Europe  the Bahamas especially applauds the determined efforts of those countries to bring their economies into balance and encourages them to pursue a fresh and vigorous programme dramatically to increase and redirect real transfers of public and private finance  aid  technology and trade to enhance world economic development.We invite the United Nations itself to adopt a fresh approach and to take another look at areas which have held out promise in the past but have yielded little success in the development of many developing countries. The Bahamas is of the view that every effort must now be made to ensure that the 1990s is a decade of opportunity. Greater effort must be exerted to reorient the global economy to make it more responsive to the needs of the developing world and to sustain growth and development.The Bahamas is therefore encouraged by the international consensus on the Declaration adopted by the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly. We consider particularly relevant its call for specialised agencies with specific developmental mandates to play a vital role in international co-operation for the revitalisation of development in the 1990c.The importance of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations to alleviating the plight of developing countries cannot be exaggerated. Hence comprehensive reform in areas of trade of particular interest to developing countries will become a realistic prospect. The Bahamas advocates work for the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Sound. In this view the Bahamas hopes also that the conclusions reached by meetings of the least developed countries in Paris this year will help reverse their marginalisation in the world economy.Strategies for development must also be environmentally sound. The Bahamas firmly supports the Conference on Environment and Development  scheduled to be held in 1992. We are confident that the opportunity will be grasped not only to consolidate current efforts to save the world's environment from degradation  but to establish a new and affective regime for Managing and safeguarding our environment  particularly the marine environment.Member States are increasingly requesting the United Nations to assume a leadership role in a myriad of social  economic and humanitarian questions. We have collectively taken decisive strides to address crucial international issues  including drug abuse  illicit trafficking  debt  poverty  development  crime and apartheid. Commitment to the well-being of the children of the world was reaffirmed by Heads of State and government in the recent historic Summit for Children.High hopes and expectations are being placed in the United Nations; yet its weak financial situation continues to jeopardise its ability to perform Expectations must be matched with requisite financial commitments. We hope that arrears will be addressed as a matter of priority so that the Organisation may cease having to juggle resources to survive. It is our joint responsibility to ensure the Organisation's operational efficiency so that its prospects for positive accomplishment can be enhanced.You see  the United Nations remains our best alternative to international chaos and our best approach to international order. Important new dynamics have been introduced by the rapprochement of the super-Powers  and by dramatic events in various parts of the world such as Eastern Europe and Namibia. Collective security has been allowed to work for the first time. As a result  the Organisation has been greatly strengthened. As always  the Bahamas pledges to continue to be a committed and active participant in all efforts to improve our Organisation and our world. "
"17",826,"BLR",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to you  a representative of neutral and non-aligned Malta  which is making active use of its standing in the world to promote peace and international co-operation  on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at its current session  which will mark the forty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. We are very glad to see in the United Nations family Namibia and Liechtenstein  which have joined the United Nations during this memorable year for the Organisation.First of all  I should like to express my deep respect for the United Nations  which has done so much to strengthen confidence and understanding among peoples. By its many activities and initiatives  the United Nations has convincingly proved how indispensable it is to the world community of States.I feel obliged to emphasise that  under- the influence of objective processes  our complicated and diverse world is becoming ever more interrelated and interdependent  and it is in ever greater need of a mechanism capable of constructively looking into its common problems and searching for mutually acceptable solutions. The role of this mechanism was assigned to the United Nations from its very inception  but only now  when there have been truly great changes in world events  when the idea of the supremacy of the interests of all mankind over all other interests is being more and more widely accepted  can the United Nations carry out fully and with the necessary effectiveness its mission as the greater unifier of the world's peoples. It can be said without exaggeration that in recent years a rebirth of the United Nations has begun  and it is gratifying that this process is continuing to gain momentum. I am firmly convinced that this unique Organisation can see opening before it abundant new possibilities for a successful harmonisation of the interests of individual States and those of the community of nations as a whole. The time has surely come for the United Nations to become in fact the collective intelligence of all mankind. All of us are greatly in need of this. A pressing need for international support is certainly being felt by our Republic  which has started on the path of a fundamental reordering of all its social  political and economic structures. That path will undoubtedly lead it to the highway of genuine democracy.In July of this year the Parliament of Byelorussia  which had been formed as α result of free democratic elections  adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty. As a result of that extraordinarily important document  our people is becoming the true master in its own house and is opening great possibilities for full participation by Byelorussia in the activities of the international community  whether in the political  economic  cultural or other areas of co-operation. The Declaration states ""The Byelorussian SSS has set itself the goals of making its territory a nuclear-free zone  and the Republic a neutral State."" We understand that it will not be easy to attain these goals. Many factors are involved here  and we shall need considered  realistic and stage-by-stage measures.I should like to inform members that one of the first steps in this direction has already been taken. A month ago the Byelorussian SSR took part for the first time  as an observer  in the Conference of States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Of course  for such a State as Byelorussia the question of neutrality is no less complex  and perhaps even more so. That is why the Republic is vitally interested in the success of international efforts at all levels which can ensure the creation of the conditions necessary for it to acquire the status of a nuclear-free zone and a neutral State  Fro  this rostrum  I wish to declare that we are ready to take an active part in this process in order to create a safe future for our own people and for other peoples. That is the reason why our Republic intends to watch closely the development of processes on the European continent. Byelorussia is situated at the crossroads of Europe. Therefore front time immemorial it has been doomed to be an area of military activities in most major conflicts.There is no need to remind members of the plight of our people during the Second World War  suffering all the horrors of enemy invasion. Deadly flames burnt out our soil and left their tragic mark on literally every family. That is why for Byelorussia the idea of an ""all-European house''' is a guarantee for the safe future of its peace-loving people  which has suffered so much.We intend to take an active part in building that house and in creating common economic  ecological  cultural  legal and informational spheres on the continent. The signing in Moscow on 12 September of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany concludes  in my opinion  one of the most important primary stages of construction and creates favourable conditions for further efforts.Byelorussia is particularly interested in the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of Europe  in rapid progress towards a continent completely free from such armaments and  naturally  in the establishment of nuclear-free zones in other regions of the world.  We believe that the most important way to reduce military confrontation is through the firm establishment of the ideas of purely defensive military doctrines and armed-forces structures and through the widespread practical application of the principle of reasonable sufficiency of defence.In our view  military factors in security should increasingly be replaced by non-military ones. The creation of all-European political structures  the transition to a new Europe and from mutual understanding to interaction  mutually beneficial trade  joint efforts in various spheres for the benefit of peoples  including co-operation in preserving their national identity - all of those constitute the basis which will make the all-European house safe and stable. That way is the way of the future.I must emphasise that this is the path that Byelorussia is going to take. We are ready to develop constructive co-operation with representatives of all countries end systems. We should like to establish particularly close contacts with our neighbours in Europe  including the countries of Central Europe - in other words  that region to our west with which Byelorussia has had historical ties.Endeavouring to ensure security and prosperity for its people  our Republic is no less interested than other States in preventing a global nuclear conflict or any other armed conflict. Such conflicts  aside from being destructive of the foundations of security and ruinous for the participants  place an additional burden on those States which bear the financial costs of peace-keeping operations. Of course  those expenditures are necessary. However  they constitute a very heavy burden for various States  including ours. It is surely tine to formulate this question in a different ways those States which are guilty of illegal actions should reimburse to the world community the cost of restoring the peace. In Byelorussia  as probably throughout the world  the events in the Middle East are a cause of extreme concern. In my opinion  the unprecedented solidarity shown by members of the Security Council during this crisis is an encouraging sign for a safe future in this region and everywhere on our planet. It is quite clear that this requires careful attention on the part of ail countries of the world community.The Byelorussian SSR supports the Security Council resolutions aimed at a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Persian Gulf region. We believe that the United Nations has the right to expect the Government of Iraq to comply with the Security Council's demands  the most important of which is the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from the State of Kuwait in order to restore that State's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.I should like to point out that in recent years Byelorussia has done much to consolidate the efforts of States aimed at preventing the creation of new weapons of mass destruction. We intend to continue our active work in this important area  and we are convinced that avoiding the danger of introducing new military technologies  especially in the field of weapons of mass destruction  is more reasonable than painful efforts to eliminate new weapons from military arsenals. How dangerous even the peaceful use of nuclear technologies are is something that we unfortunately have learned by our own bitter experience. Four years age Byelorussia fell victim to the consequences of a horrible disaster - one that did not take place in our territory.The accident at the nuclear power plant in the small town of Chernobyl became a great calamity shared by the Byelorussian people as well as the Ukrainian and Russian peoples  a tragedy of truly planetary proportions. The malfunctioning of one single nuclear reactor contaminated enormous areas and endangered the health of the population in many countries. But the heaviest burden is that borne by the people of Byelorussia. Seventy per cent of the radioactive fall-out appeared in the territory of the Republic. Not just a narrow strip of land adjacent to the reactor  as was thought initially  but the entire - and Ī emphasise this - the entire territory of the Republic has become a zone of national ecological disaster.Today Chernobyl is beating in our hearts. It beats with the radioactive discharges in Geiger counters in our fields and in the streets of our cities and towns. It is in the deceptive tranquil beauty of those forests and rivers that no one may enter. One must see the despair of a peasant unable to cultivate the land on which his ancestors had grown crops for centuries  the grief and helplessness of a mother who sees her children dying before her eyes  the silent sorrow of old people forced to leave forever the beloved villages and towns where they had spent their entire lives and where their families are buried.Our Republic suffered and is continuing to suffer enormous damage. More than 2.2 million people  that is every fifth resident of the Republic  18 per cent of the most productive farmland and 20 per cent of all forests are in the zone of long-term radiation. The external and internal radiation doses absorbed by Byelorussia's population at the time of the accident from short-lived radionuclides and still being absorbed from long-lived radionuclides are the highest known in practice anywhere in the world. According to the most conservative estimates  the direct economic loss alone amounts to about 10 annual budgets. Restoration will require more than financial resources. There is a need  an immediate and pressing need  for equipment  modern medicines  state-of-the-art know-how and technology. There is even & need for food because we have been forced to stop agricultural production on a large part of our territory. Unfortunately  the true scale of the tragedy did not become dear to us immediately  since it was the first time in world history that such an event had occurred. How it is evident that the grave consequences  which will be felt for centuries  and the extent of the radioactive contamination make Chernobyl  without exaggeration  the greatest disaster in the history of mankind.The Chernobyl tragedy has spread far beyond our frontiers. There is an inescapable spread of radionuclides. We must stop it. We must acquire experience for mankind on how to cope with the consequences of such a disaster. That is why I appeal in my grief  on behalf of our people  to the entire world community. Today our borders are open to receive help  and we hope that a growing awareness of the scale of the disaster will step up this help. We must eliminate the threat to the health of people in dozens of countries.Our people has always borne its burdens on its own shoulders. We are doing everything in our power to eliminate the consequences of the disaster. However  I wish to stress once again that its dimensions are so vast that without concerted international efforts the task will be impossible. From this lofty rostrum I should like to express the deep gratitude of the Parliament and Government of Byelorussia to all States  all organisations and all people of good will who  responding to our appeal  have extended a helping hand at this painful time for our people. We thank them all most sincerely for their great and noble actions. Our special gratitude goes to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his efforts and to all members of the Economic and Social Council for the unanimous adoption of the resolution on co-operation to eliminate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. In this hall  whose walls have heard descriptions of the grief and the tears of millions of people who have fallen victim to various disasters  I make an appeal  on behalf of the Government of Byelorussia  for the solidarity of peoples and States at a time of unprecedented disaster  that of radioactive contamination with direct global consequences. Any support  any offer of help will be welcomed with gratitude. Byelorussians as a people are facing Hamlet's dilemma not in a merely philosophical but in a horrifyingly literal sense.The Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Byelorussian SSR states:""The Byelorussian SS5 shall use its freedom und sovereignty first and foremost to save the people of the Byelorussian SSR from the effects of the Chernobyl disaster.""We believe that the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session will take major measures. In our opinion  it is necessary to adopt a special resolution reflecting an understanding of the planetary scale of this disaster and spelling out specific measures to co-ordinate the activities of the United Nations specialized agencies aimed at overcoming the global and local consequences of the disaster.No would also consider it justified to transfer Byelorussia  for the period of recovery  from the category of donor country to that of receiving country in respect of United Nations technical assistance. We hope that this proposal will be met with understanding and support by States Members of the United Nations and the members of other international organisations. We have no intention of becoming totally immersed in our own problems and will continue to be open to the problems and sorrows of the entire planet. For example  the Byelorussian SSR  together with the world community  is now involved in setting up effective international co-operation for environmental protection  for the acceleration of the economic and social development of developing countries and for the observance of human rights and freedoms. We support the idea of convening in 1992 a United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.In order to ensure decent living conditions for our people and to survive in this difficult  even critical  situation  we must change over to a democratic State structure that emancipates the thought  initiative and energy of people and focuses on the individual and on his rights and interests.We also need a much more efficient economy. In search of a more socially oriented and efficient economic way of life  we are moving towards a market economy. Such a rapid transition from one economic model to another is a difficult matter. Now we are engaged in a careful study of world experience. Naturally  we are interested in the models that have produced good results within relatively short periods of time. However  there is a problem in applying useful world-wide experience to our circumstances and adapting our circumstances to that experience. Therefore we are keenly interested in expert opinion  consultative services  effective joint ventures  capital investments and the creation of export potential. For these purposes  my Government is ready to work with foreign partners in bold and innovative ways.We are prepared to trade in industrial and agricultural products and to engage in more complex forms of economic co-operation. And I am sure that you  as plenipotentiary representatives of your States  will convey to your Governments our readiness for the closest and most diversified kind of co-operation. In turn  I wish to assure you that we will spare no) efforts to make such co-operation mutually beneficial and fruitful.The people of Byelorussia  which underwent many ordeals and enormous suffering during the Second World War and whose vitality has once again been sorely tested by the Chernobyl disaster  wants good relations with all. It wants peace  stability and prosperity.It is the duty of us all  the duty of the world community  to justify the aspirations and hopes of our peoples  to ensure that the end of the second millennium is recorded in history as a time of seized  not missed  opportunities.I wish the President and the Secretary-General success in their difficult but noble work."
"18",861,"BLZ",45,1990,"﻿The work of this Organisation over the past year has heightened the reality of the United Nations as a dynamic  credible and strong institution that is responsive to the new challenges facing the international community. We are particularly impressed by the conclusions reached at the special sessions of the General Assembly on apartheid  the international fight against drugs  international economic co-operation and the plight of refugees  and more recently by the effective measures taken by the Security Council on the crisis in the Gulf.Against that backdrop  the delegation of Belize is heartened at your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. We wish you well and assure you of our co-operation in your challenging task. Your appointment can without a doubt b· regarded as a tribute to Malta  with which we share a Commonwealth heritage and membership of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Malta is an example to the smaller States within this Organisation  and its importance has been noted in its delegation's ardent efforts on issues such as aging  the protection of the environment and the promotion of the concept of the common heritage of mankind. Your own accomplishments  Mr. President  and your special concern for human rights  stand you in good stead to steer the Assembly through the current session.I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation to Major-General Joseph Garba for his accomplishments during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Allow me to pay a deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  whose dedication and energy continue to inspire us.My delegation welcomes the Principality of Liechtenstein to the family of nations  and looks forward to an increasing role for the smaller States in our guest for global harmony.This session of the General Assembly takes place at an extraordinary time for the world. The crisis of the past few months in the Persian Gulf brings home forcefully the realisation that peace is more than the absence of war. The easing of East-West tensions and the arms control agreements between the super-Powers brought a new hope for peace and a high degree of optimism. The end of the cold war coincided with an incredible wave of human freedom sweeping across many continents  but the semblance of peace was shown to be structured in a fragile framework.The United Nations was created at San Francisco after the Second World War for the express purpose of maintaining international peace and security. Chapter VII of the Charter contains a blueprint for an international security system with an enforcement capacity to deter aggression and prevent local disputes from erupting into firmed conflict. Had it been implemented  it could have gone a long way towards establishing the rule of law worldwide  and saving the world both from the scourge of war and from the waste of resources on the instruments of war. But the Charter's promise was not kept.Some years ago  the Independent Commission on International Security Issues - the Palme Commission - recommended a structure for preventive peace-keeping  involving fact-finding missions and military  collective security forces  all to be deployed in advance of armed conflict. Is it not time for us to re-examine these proposals  and move to strengthen the United Nations security system? The recent events are a chilling reminder that even in these times of apparent peace  small  vulnerable States must be on guard to protect their sovereignty and territorial integrity.We cannot condone the invasion of Kuwait  whatever the pretext for it. Aggression cannot be tolerated. The use of force to settle differences cannot be permitted. The international stand taken against the Iraqi aggression  the imposition of sanctions  is logical and imperative. At the same time  we support the efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in the Gulf which would result in the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This crisis dramatises the crying need for peace and justice in the entire Middle East. Cannot this crisis be converted into an opportunity for a comprehensive peace settlement?The Arab-Israeli conflict  with the struggle of the Palestinian people for justice and their right to self-determination and independence at its core  has rightly been an issue of central concern to the entire international community. The implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions  which could guarantee independent statehood to the Palestinians and also Israel's security  must be the objective of a United Nations sponsored international conference. Belize also reaffirms its full solidarity with Lebanon in that country's legitimate demand for the unconditional withdrawal of all occupation forces. We must bring an end to the senseless bloodshed in that ravaged country.Belize avails itself of this opportunity to welcome Namibia's membership of the United Nations. We salute the leaders of Namibia and the crucial role of the United Nations in the negotiating process that led to Namibia's independence.My delegation also welcomes Mr. Nelson Mandela back into the world of struggle for the liberation of his people. We reaffirm our support for the international community’s maintaining a firm stand against the South African racist regime until apartheid is eliminated and the majority of the South African people can exercise their basic right to equal opportunities and equal participation in the political process.A few days ago  we witnessed the unification of East and West Germany. This remarkable transformation evolved through the will and the work of the people of Germany. We wish the new State well  and anticipate that this move will usher in a period of reconciliation  peace and co-operation in line with a new world order.Unified Germany should be an inspiration to the people of the Korean peninsula in their search for mutual confidence as a means to resolve an ideological dispute  to the benefit of mankind.In our own region  Belize applauds the elections and peaceful transfer of power in Nicaragua as в significant step in the resolution of the conflict in that country  and in Central America as a whole. The former President of Nicaragua  Mr. Daniel Ortega  and President Violetta Chamorro have made an invaluable contribution to the cause of peace in that troubled region. We are of course aware that many problems still remain in establishing democracy and in national reconciliation. The situation in El Salvador continues to be of concern  enmeshed as the country is in a civil war in which there can be no winners. Peaceful dialogue  respect for human rights and the rule of law are the essential ingredients for a just and lasting peace for the people of El Salvador.The search for a democratic path in Haiti continues. The holding of national elections and the establishment of institutions committed to the democratic process are the objectives to which Belize  as a member of the Caribbean Community (CABICOM)  is committed to assisting in every way possible. The Prime Minister of Belize has been personally engaged in this endeavour  along with former United States President Carter. It is our hope and prayer that the people of Haiti will be allowed to emerge from the long night of terror and tyranny into a dawn of peace  justice and freedom.We turn now to the problem of refugees in Central America. Refugees and displaced persons remain a humanitarian problem of Herculean magnitude. For this reason  the Belize delegation recalls with satisfaction the successful meeting earlier this year of the Follow-Up Committee of the International Conference on Central American Refugees (CIRBFCA). We commend the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  as well as the pledges of the international donor community  in response to the needs of our societies  affected by the thousands of refugees who have come to our shores in search of peace and in hope of a better life  the ask for the continued co-operation of the international community in dealing with this phenomenon  whose social impact on small countries such as Belize can be devastating  unless addressed in a timely and constructive manner. Promoting peace and economic development is still the challenge we face. We meet in the shadow of the Gulf crisis with its attendant economic uncertainties caused by the heavy increases in fuel prices. We meet as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports that over a billion of our fellow human beings live in absolute poverty  that nearly 900 million adults are unable to read and write and that 40 000 children who could be saved die every day in our world because of underdevelopment and poverty. In many countries in Africa and Latin America the 1980s have witnessed stagnation  or even reversal  in human achievements. With the decline in commodity prices and the continuing high prices for manufactured goods and oil  the inevitable result is the worsening unequal exchange affecting most of the third world.It has been rightly said that true development should be measured not by growth rates but rather by what has been termed the quality of life. The decade of the 19903 must focus on human development  particularly in the least developed and developing countries. Belize subscribes to the view that human freedom is vital for human development; that people must be free to exercise their choices; that the process of development must create an environment in which people individually and collectively may develop their full potential and have a reasonable chance of leading productive and creative lives. The challenge we face is to manage economic growth  to make better use of our human resources  to develop the productive sector of the economy while addressing the basic needs of our people for food  water  education  housing  health care and  of equal importance  the creation of jobs - the assurance of human dignity.The primary responsibility for attaining those objectives is ours; but a favourable external environment is vital for the support of human development strategies for the 19908. In the words of Barber Conable  President of the World Bank: ""increased flows of financial development assistance are needed if developing countries are to succeed in implementing poverty reduction strategies.Official aid flows have fallen as a percentage of industrial countries' gross domestic product  just as the need has been most acute. This is unacceptable."" Technical co-operation from our partners in development must be restructured if it is to help build human capabilities and national capacities. As the UNDP report for 1990 points out  in many developing countries the amount of technical assistance flowing each year into the salaries and banks of foreign experts far exceeds the national civil service budgets. More successful technical co-operation in the 1990s requires that programmes should focus more on national capacity-building - through the exchange of experience  the transfer of competence and expertise and the fuller mobilisation and use of national development capacities.This development challenge has become all the more pressing in many of our societies because of the scourge of drugs. The demand for  production of  traffic in and illicit consumption of narcotics threaten the physical health of people and the political  economic  social and cultural structures of nations. Belize is deploying a major effort  in collaboration with neighbouring States  such as Mexico  and all friendly Governments  to eliminate this serious threat to our societies.The development challenge of the 1990s brings with it the clear realisation that sustainable development must be perceived as a matter of global ecological security. In 1992 the world community will convene in Brazil to discuss environmental concerns. We look forward to the adoption of a global plan of action to reverse the degradation of the environment and ensure its preservation. In Belize our government and people share a firm commitment to protecting our forests  our wildlife  our coral-reef system and our natural resources for generations of Belizeans yet unborn. But there are new challenges to our environment which require attention and assistance. There is  for instance  the phenomenon of rapid urban development  which demands new and innovative strategies and resources to deal with the issues of water and sewerage  garbage collection  sanitation  slum clearance  housing development and urban planning with proper amenities for healthy living. The effectiveness of Government responses and municipal action to these issues will largely determine human development in our growing cities of tomorrow. We are encouraged by the political resolve of the world community to give children a better future. The recently concluded World Summit for Children has provided a fresh impulse to press for the goals of adequate nutrition  primary health care and basic education for all our children in the decade ahead. These may not be the issues that attract headlines in our newspapers and electronic media  but they are no less deserving of our highest priority. It is this investment today that will determine tomorrow's future.Life in the twenty-first century for our children and future generations will be determined by how we can best manage to overcome the challenges of our time. The young people of today do not understand the logic of war. We can learn a great lesson from them and give peace a chance. This is our hope and prayer."
"19",908,"BOL",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf  allow me to express warmest congratulations to Mr. Guido de Marco upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this forty-fifth session. Given his personal qualities  his presence here is a guarantee of even-handedness and fairness.Allow me also to pay a tribute of admiration and support to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and  through him  to the United Nations and its specialized agencies.We wish on this occasion to welcome to our Organization the Principality of Liechtenstein  confident that it will make a valuable contribution to the continuing efforts of the United Nations and its Members for a better world.We likewise hail the presence in our midst of a free and independent Namibia  which throughout its struggle enjoyed the support of my country. We are living in amassing times  when unusual  sometimes unforeseeable  changes have occurred and continue to occur - changes that are of the greatest import to the history of mankind. We have seen the collapse of anachronistic political confrontation  a vigorous resurgence of democracy  broader respect for human rights  and other positive developments that allow us a glimpse of better times for future generations. But  unfortunately  we are far from living in an ideal world. There persist enormous inequalities between the developed and the developing countries  and  despite the new climate of detente and dialogue  we can still see conflicts bringing destruction and suffering to some regions. Moreover  political liberty still requires the firm underpinning of economic liberty.Just when we thought that the new mood of dialogue and detente would finally hold sway in international relations we were taken unawares by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Bolivia - a country long dedicated to peace  supported the resolutions of the Security Council.Consistent with its tradition of pacifism and strict compliance with the principles of the Charter  Bolivia believes that the time has come to address regional problems in a climate marked by rational and constructive dialogue. In this regard  we call upon the parties to the Cambodian problem to spare no effort to arrive at a peaceful and negotiated solution under the auspices of the Organization.With regard to the situation in the Middle East  Bolivia  as it has done in the past  will support every effort aimed at a negotiated solution - in particular  the proposal to hold an international peace conference  under United Nations auspices  in which all parties concerned would participate. The fall of the Berlin Hall and the ensuing German unity are bound to give us great satisfaction. We believe these events to be indicative of the new course in relations between East and West  for this is the peaceful destruction  by the will of a people  of one of the last of the stigmas that are a legacy of the Second World War. My country is observing with high hopes the process being pursued by the Governments of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Korea in this new climate of detente and dialogue. We fraternally urge both parties to assert every effort towards reunification  for the benefit ultimately of the noble Korean people.We the States Members of the Organisation  have other urgent problems to face on the heavy-laden agenda of the Assembly.The scourge of drug trafficking and drug addiction continues to afflict all people. Its frightful prevalence  matched only by the arms race  has already spread all over the world. It is safe to say that no society is free from this evil.The illicit profits from drug trafficking have found their way into the formal economic channels and are a source of corruption  violence and destabilisation of the democratic processes attained by our peoples at so great a cost.Much remains to be done in our joint endeavour to eradicate drug trafficking and to save its victims. We should however  recognise that important  meaningful steps have been taken to that end. We hail the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of which my country is already a signatory.Bolivia has offered ample evidence of its political determination to eradicate this evil. Just a year ago  in this same forum  the President of Bolivia Jaime Pas Zamora presented to the international community the broad outlines of the thesis of ""Alternative Development""  the key elements of which are the creation of new sources of employment  growth and diversification of exports  the attraction of increased capital flows  and the opening of new markets.Bolivia approaches the resolution of the problems linked to coca and its derivatives through a national development strategy that seeks not just crop Bolivia substitution  but substitution of the coca economy  a task which requires the involvement of the producer countries and the rest of the world community.	We can afford no delay in introducing new patterns of production that will provide farmers employed in planting coca leaves with an alternative livelihood  and this implies a change in the structural process of socio-economic development.Bolivia has put forward the thesis of alternative development on various occasions and in different forums. That thesis has been recognized and incorporated in various international documents  but we are still awaiting fruitful and realistic international joint action. Its full acceptance allows us to believe that its implementation will lead us to the resolution of this problem. We reiterate today that the success of alternative development will be the result not only of the efforts of the Bolivian people and Government  but also of the positive economic and trade response of the international community.Another item that deserves priority attention at this session of the Assembly is the environment. Dire poverty brings environmental deterioration in its wake  and this in turn leads to a vicious cycle of ecological blight and human misery.In Bolivia  environmental protection and conservation have taken on new dimensions and concrete measures have been adopted. We have declared an ""ecological moratorium"" throughout Bolivian territory for five years  beginning with the present administration  which will mark a milestone in the dynamic relationship between development processes and the protection of nature. Protection of the environment is the expression of the political will of the people and Government of Bolivia to break with the irrational past in the management of our natural resources. It also reflects Bolivia's response to the international community's concern with this issue. As regards the environment and development  Bolivia holds that protection of the environment must be harmonized with the processes of development and economic growth so urgently needed by poor countries. Conservation of nature cannot imply condemning our peoples to backwardness  poverty and underdevelopment. On the contrary  the mechanisms that link the environment and development will have to be based on strategies for rational economic growth  always linked with respect for the interests of the international community and the region in question Bolivia views President Bush's Americas Initiative as an innovative alternative designed to mitigate the onerous burden of external debt while simultaneously bringing sufficient resources to bear on an active programme to preserve the environment.We are confident that the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  in which Bolivia will take an active part  will give rise to practical  effective decisions with regard to the solution of this problem in conformity with the principles laid down by the General Assembly in resolution 44 228 and the preparatory process for the world Conference so auspiciously begun in Nairobi last August.I must also mention a problem which weighs heavily upon my country and which has been the subject of numerous debates in this Organization as well as in regional organizations for many years. I refer to Bolivia's land-locked status.In this same forum last year Bolivia's President recalled that when it lost its Pacific Ocean territory Bolivia also ceased to be a maritime nation  as it had been upon attaining independence. The President addressed an appeal to the countries involved to face this problem is the new integration-minded spirit that befits the twenty-first century. It is in that spirit of fellow-feeling and integration that we turn to the Assembly. Bolivia once again calls upon the international community to grasp the importance of this problem  which the Organisation of America States (OAS) has repeatedly declared to be one with hemispheric implications.In this period of major changes  when old differences are being overcome by political will and constructive imagination  it is incomprehensible to the Bolivian people that the problem of its land-locked status  rooted in the past century  should not be resolved on the basis of fraternal dialogue and commonality of interests. Bolivia is convinced that the solution of many of the problems besetting Latin America can be found only through integration. It is in that spirit  and by virtue of our geographical position  which makes Bolivia a crossroads  that we are taking part resolutely and optimistically in processes of integration and co-operation such as the Latin American Integration Association  the Latin American Economic System  the Andean Group and the Plata Basin and the Amazon Pact  initiatives which are intended to focus efforts and harmonize action in pursuit of their respective objectives.With respect to co-operation and development for the elimination of poverty  permit me to speak briefly about my country's economic and political situation and about the Bolivian people's efforts to achieve a better life within a democratic  pluralistic system with full respect for human rights.The economic process in Bolivia has been examined in various forums and by various world leaders. The success o£ an economic and financial stabilisation policy has checked galloping inflation and instability has been acknowledged. This was no easy matter for the Bolivian people. Each citizen was required to make a great measure of sacrifice and to postpone the attainment of their most legitimate rights and aspirations for a better life. We have not yet resolved structural problems that are basic to socio-economic development. We have been unable to improve the level of employment  which has been further constrained by economic and financial adjustments. We have not alleviated the health problems affecting the inhabitants of my country  and the benefits of education are not reaching vast sectors of the population.The necessary economic revitalization that was to follow the stabilization process is proving slow and difficult. Our development continues to be hampered by the adverse effects of the 1988  such as unequal trade relations and international finance  the collapse of commodity prices and  principally  the crushing burden of external debt.I saw have the honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the Group of 77  since my country  Bolivia  is the current Chairman of that important group of 127 developing States Members of the United Nations.The Group of 77 has on many occasions expressed its concern at the economic stagnation of our countries throughout the past decade. But it should be stressed that a new political turning-point has been reached by the members of the United Nations with the adoption by consensus of the historic Declaration of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalisation of economic growth and development of the developing countries. That gave rise to new hopes.I urge the international community to take the steps needed to put into practice without delay the commitments and policies set out in that Declaration. Likewise we appeal to the international community to adopt and implement the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade  which is now in the final phase of negotiation. The Group of 77 views the Strategy as eminently suitable for finally overcoming the economic lag with which the majority of our countries are grappling today.I wish also to express our concern over the possible impact on the economies of developing countries of the series of structural changes taking place in the world economy.We are witnessing important political and economic changes which  together with the international community's growing awareness of the common problems we face  are bringing about a new pattern of international relations.Those changes and transformations are leading to an increasing globalisation of the economy and to greater interdependence among countries. While each State  Bolivia and each nation is responsible for adopting its own policy for economic development  such policies depend also on the existence of a favourable international economic environment. Because interdependence has different effects on different countries depending on their capacities and their impact on the world economy  it can advance the development policies of developing countries  or it can hamper them and cause them to fail. Accordingly  that process must be handled with greater equity and justice in order to avoid the increasing marginalisation of developing countries  especially in the financial  trade and technological spheres. Such marginalisation could have grave consequences with respect to improving the possibilities and standard of living of more than three quarters of the world's population.My country  Bolivia  wants fervently to ensure that all these statements may help strengthen the universal task of ensuring peace  development and integration in the democratic world  which made this a historic century through the establishment of the United Nations."
"20",955,"BRA",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  please accept my congratulations on your election. Your talents will ensure that the Assembly’s work is conducted in a fair and efficient manner. I wish also to convey to your predecessor our appreciation of the important tasks he accomplished. May I also assure the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  that Brazil has been following  and supports  the diplomatic activity he has undertaken in the discharge of his functions. We recognize in him a dynamic Secretary-General dedicated to the lofty purposes of the United Nations. A few days ago  Liechtenstein was admitted as a new Member State. On behalf of Brazil I extend my welcome to Liechtenstein and wish it every success at the United Nations. I am addressing the General Assembly for the first time. I note with emotion that the general debate is opening precisely at a time when many and profound changes in Brazil and throughout the world are bringing about a revision of concepts and misconceptions that for decades have asphyxiated the community of nations. I wish to convey to the Assembly the views of the people of Brazil and their new Government on the prospects for peace  freedom and progress throughout the world  and on the role to be played by this Organization in the years ahead. I am convinced that the dawn of the new era we are striving to create will certainly shine forth from this privileged forum of reflection and analysis. The brilliance of that dawn will depend on our individual and collective endeavours towards world peace  the prosperity of nations and the growing solidarity among the peoples of the world. In the last 12 months a number of events have transformed the outlook of international relations  especially at the East-West level. Peoples who had been subjected to authoritarian regimes resolutely and definitively chose to follow the path of democracy. The end of the cold war represented the liquidation of a bitter legacy of disappointment  confrontation and risk to the very survival of humanity. The relaxation of international tensions has shed light upon the understanding of our common destiny  emphasising the global nature of the relationship among peoples and between mankind and the environment. New and promising trends have almost led us into euphoria and complacency. But the vulnerability of the international order  the destabilising effect of certain regional crises and the seriousness of economic problems would warrant caution and reserve. The crisis that has befallen Kuwait presents an unexpected and serious threat to collective pace. The Brazilian Government deems it essential that the mandatory resolutions adopted by the Security Council be immediately complied with.These resolutions were adopted in response were adopted in response to the clamour of international public opinion. Their legal basis is found in the Charter. All parties involved must therefore abide by them  not as a sign of weakness but as an inescapable legal and political obligation. This seems to be the only just and peaceful means to restore tranquility to the region and the world at large. It is our belief that all States are profoundly committed to peace and to the agile and effective use of diplomatic means to avoid conflict. By immediately and fully complying with the resolutions  Member States have in turn unequivocally indicated that a breach of international legal order is intolerable in times when even conventional weapons have awesome destructive force and the international economy presents a network of complementary interests. They have also expressed their firm support for United Nations efforts in the region as a whole  where many a people deserving  as all others  of peace  security and prosperity have for so long been vexed by crises. Brazil is particularly concerned with the fate of the long-suffering Lebanese people  torn by internal strife  their sovereign capacity to decide their own destiny thwarted by the presence of foreign troops. I reaffirm the determination of my Government fully to comply with Security Council resolution 661 (1990) within its domestic jurisdiction.The decisions of the Council affect the economic interests of Member States quite differently; and Brazil  which  as is generally known  had been struggling with difficulties prior to the crisis  ranks among the countries outside the region that have been most adversely affected. Closely attuned to the more positive trends of contemporary history  Brazil is undergoing a process of deep transformation which sets it irreversibly on the path towards full democracy  economic liberalisation and social justice. Elected by my fellow citizens in the freest elections ever held in our history  I have taken upon myself crucial personal and political responsibilities before 150 million Brazilians. The mandate conferred upon me by the people is that of swiftly promoting modernisation and fully integrating the country into the world economy in order to render it more competitive and so that a its people may reach the levels of well-being to which their talents and industriousness entitle them. It is my commitment to rehabilitate both the State and society  to guarantee fully functioning democratic institutions  to restructure and revitalise the economy  to defeat inflation  to unleash the creative forces of the private sector  and to fight the misery which still torments a portion of my people. It is also my duty to protect the most vulnerable segments of society. This explains why I have given top priority to children and the young. Children  it has been repeatedly stated  embody the future  and this is particularly true in a country like Brazil  with a predominantly young population  which anxiously seeks modernisation. We are aware that our country faces dramatic problems in this respect. We make no secret of these problems nor of our resolve to solve them. The comprehensive initiatives we have launched on behalf of children indicate how seriously committed we are to converting Brazil’s potential into a lasting reality. I therefore welcome with enthusiasm the initiative for convening the World Summit for Children  with which Brazil associates itself and in which I intend to participate personally in an intensive and constructive manner. As a result of important ongoing changes  deep-seated pessimism is vanishing and opposing views are in the process of being reconciled. Authoritarianism is doomed. Political and psychological attitudes based upon steady progress towards freedom  democracy and improved dialogue among nations are asserting themselves. At this point no Government can avoid or be excluded from the debate on the prospects for a future world order. In Latin /america we have reached  not without difficulty  an advanced stage of democratic evolution and respect for human rights  which constitute for us a source of pride and renewed encouragement. In our region  as in others  men  women and above all the young have new energies and hopes. Once again Latin America was proved itself worthy of the dreams of emancipation of its peoples and is reconciled with its true democratic calling. In Africa remnants of the colonial past are crumbling at the same time that the last bastion of segregation and racism is finally beginning to break apart. Together with my fellow Brazilians I salute the independence of Namibia  a process which my country consistently supported  and we wish the young State the realisation of its enormous potential. I also welcome the release of Nelson Mandela  which was enthusiastically applauded in Brazil  and I wish him every success in his courageous struggle. The international community’s agenda has become global in scope. The United Nations is faced with the task of establishing a new framework for peace and prosperity. it is no longer possible to conceive of a world chronically split into feuding halves. Neither ideology nor poverty can be allowed to come between human beings.The trend towards globalisation holds true for every quadrant of the world  East and West  North and South. The yearning for freedom  dignity and better living conditions knows no boundaries. New opportunities must not be missed lest we run the risk of replacing the obsolete East-West confrontation with the aggravation of the North-South crisis and of adding new mistakes that may jeopardise the future of international society.The Brazilian Government is prepared to discuss the basic outline of a new international structure that can ensure peace and further co-operation. It would not suffice merely to preserve the current global political and economic arrangements and even less to repeat the past  recent or remote. The highly antiquated concept of power  as the capacity for destruction and as an expression of economic hegemony  should be finally abandoned. It is necessary to dismantle its practical apparatus. Thus  first  military alliances must undergo profound transformation in order to reflect and interdependent world we now live in. Secondly  partial negotiation on disarmament should be expand in order to assume a general and complete scope  above all in the fields of nuclear and chemical weapons  in response to the expectations of the international community. Lastly  regional tensions must be thoroughly addressed in diplomatic and political terms in order that they may be eliminated as hotbeds of global instability. Above all it is imperative to articulate a new concepts of world power as a revolutionary capacity for invention  production and construction for the benefit of all nations and all peoples. Peace is multifaceted and should translate at the international level the trends towards democracy  participation and representation. Democratisation of the world order is a prerequisite for a peace that is both just and sound  free from any kind of threat. Peace must mean more than the abolition of conflicts  of threats and of the hegemonic preponderance of the most developed or most powerful. Thus  the major international institutions must reflect the new realities and be capable of accommodating the rapid and fruitful increase in contacts among States and the formation of multiple groupings. This comprehensive concept of peace is illustrated by the new pace set for the process of dialogue and integration in South America. Day by day the understanding within Amazonian  Andean and Southern Cone groups of nations gains in substance. Outstanding among these efforts is the determination displayed by the Governments of Brazil and Argentinian in establishing a common market before December 1994. The process of integration under way in the Southern Cone involves  in addition to Brazil and Argentina  the fraternal countries of Paraguay  Uruguay and Chile.In Latin America a pioneering initiative of diplomatic co-operation  the Group of Rio  grows stronger and has now attained political maturity. Our region is thus in a position to engage in a dialogue with the centres of the world economy  the United States  Western Europe and Japan  in order to explore new opportunities for economic exchange and co-operation. In that regard the economic initiative recently launched by the United States Government met with a positive reaction on the part of many Latin American countries. It will certainly be consolidated in the next few months. In the South Atlantic the sons of peace and co-operation established by a resolution of the General Assembly gains in substance and  with the relaxation of international tensions  will encompass new elements of global interest  such as the protection and preservation of the marine environment. In this field our sons of peace and of co-operation may play an innovative role on a global scale  provided more committed financial and technological support is available. Brazil ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco and has reiterated in international forums its respect for its purposes and those of related International agreements. Recently Brazil and Argentian publicly announced that an intense exchange of views is taking place among interested parties on the implementation of the Treaty of Tlatelolco. That pioneering Latin American initiative in the field of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons proceeded all other efforts  whether regional or universal in scope  devoted to the same objective. I believe  however  that the time has come to go on e step further. Brazil today discards the idea of any experiments that might involve nuclear explosions  even if only for peaceful purposes. We trust other nations will consider the possibility of following the same path. All changes that seek to consolidate freedom and democracy to strengthen true peace and international security  to cast away old myths and to reconcile efficiency with justice are of interest to Brazil. Not every new development on the international scene  however  is forward looking. The structure of power have  in essence  not yet been altered. In fact one may even fear a reinforcement of the international stratification  both economic and political. This could include a biased discrimination hindering access to scientific and technological knowledge. Efforts towards disarmament are still incipient and their diplomatic handling has never been so remote from multilateral forums. Military incidents in different parts of the world demonstrate that many regional security problems have not yet been addressed. Racialist and xenophobic outbursts are unfortunately recurring in some quarters. Nevertheless  we have not abandoned optimism. History shall not be rewritten. We think that  faced with the global challenges of modern life  humanity will march - despite present difficulties and obstacles - towards new  peaceful and productive forms of co-existence. The global structure shall allow for new strides in the pursuit of human happiness. We are not condemned to the twin threats of violence and political confrontation. A promising agenda is being announced which includes  not only the reactivation of economic development and international co-operation  but also issues involving the observance of all human - political  economic and social - as well as concerted efforts to protect the environment on a global scale and the fight against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs. As East-West tensions disappear  the question of establishing new guidelines for the international economic order asserts itself with renewed vigour. There persist the perverse practices and mechanism of protectionism and managed trade. Such partial openings as may occur are based on the rigid observance of the principle of reciprocity  to the detriment of more fragile economies. It is unsettling that efforts on behalf of economic and trade liberalisation should share the stage with the present neo-protectionist wave. As it opens up its economy to the world  and in the understanding that an open world economy will be established  Brazil is participating in the current Uruguay Round and is confident that these negotiations  conducted within the framework of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  may correct the persistent disorder and atrophy affecting international trade. The use of expert subsidies and other domestic support measures on the part of developed nations has reached excessive levels  strongly affecting developing nations otherwise capable of increasing the world’s supply of agricultural or agro-industrial products. It is deplorable tat the protectionist arsenal currently in use by the developed world should under the increase in the level of world food production  while hunger still afflicts a large portion of mankind. We look forward  with great hope  to balanced results in all areas currently under negotiation at the Uruguay Round  which may strengthen multilateralism and nullify restrictionist trends. We do not want the freezing of North-South inequalities or the continued stifling of free competition by artificial means. In the context of well-known economic difficulties faced by the major economic Powers  both domestically and in their relations with each other  there looms the risk that the megablocs will not be guided by global interests  by the logic of economic openness and a sense of the whole. On the contrary  there is a risk that they will degenerate into veritable “trade fortresses”. Twin challenges have come to further cloud that outlook. The first concerns the orderly absorption of East European countries into the world market in such a way that this far-reaching and positive development does not disrupt traditional North-South trade and investment flows nor add further cause of disarray to the already precarious state of the economies of the developing countries. The second challenge derives from the persistent and radical economic inequality among nations  a fact that is in itself one of the major obstacles to the full development of social and economic forces on a world scale. The issue of economic development and international co-operation must be placed at the top of the multilateral agenda. In Brazil a comprehensive and coherent programme of social and economic reform is being developed which  in order to be swiftly implemented  calls for a prompt inflow of foreign funds  granted on favourable and mutually beneficial terms. Such measures as have been adopted are already reversing and economic situations the prospects of which were distressing  and are paving the way for the immediate restoration of international co-operation with our country  Brazil. We trust this effort will meet with a positive response from our most significant partners in the developed world. We wish to make the best of the present moment  in which the new supersedes the old in so many ways. Brazil wishes to play in full its role in the conception of a global framework of peace and co-operation. In this regard  by adopting the Declaration on International Economic Co-operation last May  this Assembly came to recognise  through the unanimous voice of its Member States  that the economic revitalisation of the developing countries is the major challenge of the present decade. Brazil is seeking economic efficiency and desires that the economy of every developing country become productive. Such a goal may be reached if the world economy is better organised. This is a responsibility shared by all countries. The persistence of hunger  the deprivation of minimum amenities and the extreme economic hardship in many areas ultimately affect the whole by way of environmental devastation  systematic violation of human rights  and the production and illegal trafficking in drugs. The conscience and the way of life of every society are thus disastrously affected. The last decade  though propitious for public liberties and political pluralism  was at the same time cruel and parsimonious towards economic and social development. Development  however  is crucial for the consolidation of democratic institutions. The titanic efforts of many of the peoples of the developing world came to naught by virtue of the enormous and continuing transfer abroad of assets essential to economic growth and investment. Finding a permanent solution to the problem of foreign debt is a task of urgent and overriding concern for the future of the developing countries  and especially Latin America. The economic recovery of our peoples is an unavoidable imperative that cannot be sacrificed and that will not be sacrificed. Economic stabilisation and modernisation initiatives in developing countries and  especially  their fuller integration into the world economy  would be threatened if the foreign debt problem were to retain its present features. It seems indispensable that a serious  frank and creative dialogue should bring about solutions at the international level making for the resumption of the process of economic growth and the development of our peoples. The second major issue of the new international agenda concerns the environment. I wish to extend from this rostrum an invitation to the world to come to Brazil in 1992 for the great United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  perhaps the most important international meeting to be held in this century  by virtue of the issue it addresses  which is of vital interest to mankind  and in the light of the expected number of participants  including some at the non-governmental level. I invite all Heads of State and Government to attend that event. Brazil welcomes you with open arms. That meeting will lead to a more precise definition of the generic concern for the environment  and it will also allow agreements to be concluded on the basis of a sense of shared responsibility on the part of all international actors. For this to occur  it is incumbent upon Governments to take up their responsibilities and to revise their objectives. Brazil stands ready to do its part and is already doing its part  confident that other countries will do the same. We are energetically tackling Brazil’s environmental problems. Despite serious economic difficulties  grave social problems and the huge expanse of our territory  the Government and society of Brazil are already making efforts in the realm of the environment that compare favourably to those of other countries. As environmental monitoring develops in Brazil  we are proceeding to establish a zoning system for the country  notably in the Amazon  so as to delimit scientifically the large areas that must be fully preserved  as well as those that will serve economic development in different degrees and under rigorous discipline. Like all other developing countries  Brazil needs easier access to technologies that will permit the elimination of damages to the environment and that are environmentally safe. Such technologies should be used for the benefit of all countries. There is an urgent need for financial conditions to be established at the international level which will allow such technologies to be applied in competitive terms. The countries that throughout history have contributed most to the pollution of the environment have the greatest share of responsibility in this respect. By facilitating the availability of technologies and resources  these countries will play a crucial role in reversing the situation of environmental calamity unjustly inherited by the present generation and in offering appropriate solutions. The benefit should not be monopolised or concentrated among the few but should rather be spread out as much as possible. In a spirit of fairness we foresee that the more developed countries will commit greater resources to the correction of environmental problems. Such correction must not  even indirectly  widen the gap between rich and poor countries. A higher level of international solidarity is called for as regards the user of modern  low-cost technologies. Aware of the fact that access to technology  as well as to its production and use  is a new and accessory economic paradigm  Brazil cannot but express its strong concern with the barriers that still persist to free exchange in such a decisive.What is at stake is nothing less than our chances for integration into dynamic core of the world economy. Those countries that are subordinate in the field of technology will also be subordinate in the new international division of labour arising from technological development. International barriers portray the grim policies that virtually aside countries of late industrialisation. The concern of Brazil is understandable not only of economy of its technological capacity — which is among the most advanced in the developing world — but also because we live under democratic normalcy  with truly functioning institutions and a Government which is uncompromisingly faithful to the rule of law and to its international commitments. I could not fail to refer to the importance that the issue of human rights is gaining on our common agenda. In view of the current expansion of democratic ideals  international consideration of this matter will gain in scope and incisiveness. Brazil firmly supports this trend. We believe  in fact  that the world is on the threshold of a qualitative leap in this area. Affronts to human rights must be denounced and fought with the same vigour wherever they may occur. One of my paramount concerns in this field is preserving the life and customs of the indigenous communities of Brazil. To this end  my Government has taken drastic measures during the first six months of its mandate in an attitude of absolute respect for an unyielding protection of the rights of the Brazilian Indian. A great deal remains to be done and will indeed be done. By its efforts  the international community can be of precious help in creating world-wide conditions which would guarantee the observance of human rights in their broadest sense. It is today incumbent upon all countries to take up new obligations in ensuring the individual greater freedom of movement across borders in eliminating every vestige of discrimination and protecting the rights of foreigners. Human rights must be increasingly understood in their entirety  without artificial or specious distinctions among their various modalities. Every feature of the new world structure points to the growth of the United Nations. Important institutional changes in this Organisation may be foreseen  even before its fiftieth anniversary  to translate into terms of multilateral diplomacy the international realities emerging everywhere. The world did not stop in 1945  and a new phase in history has been in the making in the past 12 months. The United Nations  in particular  is giving evidence of increased diplomatic energy. However  the renewed tendency on the part of the permanent members of the Security Council to act as a bloc in certain instances does not seem to be in itself enough to steer us towards an institutional redefinition of the Organisation and of the Council itself.For the United Nations  as the foremost  if not the only  forum of universal scope  to be able to respond to current challenges  it will prove necessary to return to the original political intentions of the Charter  which have so often been misinterpreted  even in recent times. Those intentions struck a clear balance between the prerogatives of the permanent members of the Security Council and the preservation of the sovereign equality of Member States. The latter is a fundamental principle which should be followed as part of the negotiation process in all organs of the United Nations  including the Security Council. The new multilateralism must be truly innovative and true to the principle of equitable representation  lest it become a sterile formula or a disguise for a deeper political crisis. The last few weeks have not only clearly   directly an dramatically illustrated the system of international relations  but also exposed its capability and vulnerability. Never before have politics and diplomacy been so necessary on the multilateral scene.As we build new political and economic structures  increasing claims for justice and participation in the international order are to be added to our quest for efficiency. Our common endeavour in this Hall is  after all  the search for a modernity applicable to all nations  one in which we all identify a human face. What we wish for  from the depth of our hearts  is a world of peace  co-operation  prosperity  justice - a world built upon the basic principles of international law  a world in which we may discern on the horizon the better future that our peoples so dearly hope for  deserve and are sure to achieve. May God be with us.   "
"21",999,"BRB",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  I am pleased to join those who have congratulated you on your well-deserved election as President of the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am particularly delighted that you  a representative of a small island State  should have received this honour  at a time when the United Nations has achieved such pre-eminence.May I also take this opportunity to endorse the tributes paid to your distinguished predecessor  his Excellency Major-General Joseph N. Garba  for his masterful management of the forty-fourth session  and to express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar for his steadfast stewardship as Secretary-General of the Organisation. On behalf of the government and the people of Barbados  I should also like to avail myself of this occasion to extend a warm welcome  on behalf of the Government and the people of Barbados  to Liechtenstein  as it joins the community of nations within the Organisation.A mere two months ago  the world seemed poised on the threshold of a new and exciting era. Prospects for world peace were better than at any other time within the 45-year history of the United Nations. Today  the crisis in the Gulf caused by Iraq's blatant aggression in invading neighbouring Kuwait is placing a damper on those prospects  and is a reminder of the fragility of peace. The Government of Barbados condemns the invasion of Kuwait and calls for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi forces. We consider the invasion a flagrant violation of the norms of international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.At the beginning of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  no one would have predicted the significant changes which would take place throughout the world in less than one year. An end to East-West confrontation has led to significant political  social and economic changes in Eastern Europe. Today we salute the peoples of Germany on their reunification and welcome them to the United Nations as a single State.In a similar vein  my Government is heartened by the dialogue now taking place between the Governments and the peoples of the Korean peninsula. We look forward to the early and full representation of the peoples of Korea in the United Nations in keeping with the principle of the universality of the Organisation.My delegation is particularly encouraged by developments in southern Africa. The people of Namibia have gained their independence and have taken their rightful place in the Organisation. In South Africa  we welcome the release of Mr. Mandela  the unbanning of the African National Congress and other political parties and the relaxation of some other restrictive measures. The delegation of Barbados is also encouraged by the two rounds of talks at Groote Schuur and at Pretoria and by other areas of progress  as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the progress and in the implementation of the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa  adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session.But a great deal more still needs to be done before the system of apartheid can be abolished and a truly representative non-racial democratic society established in South Africa. The steps towards that goal  set out in the Declaration adopted at the special session  have been reaffirmed in resolution 44/244  unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on 17 September 1990. We view the developments which have occurred merely as steps in the right direction. We call on the international community to maintain all forms of pressure  including sanctions  to ensure that the evil of apartheid is eradicated from the face of the Earth. The war between Iraq and Iran has come to an end  the conflicts in Afghanistan and Central America have been largely resolved  and the long-standing crisis in Cambodia seems to be on the way to an acceptable resolution. One feature of the current wave of success is the primary role played by the United Nations and in particular by the Security Council. With the demise of super-Power confrontation and ideological polarisation there now exists a refreshing spirit of co-operation  and prospects for lasting world peace have never been so good. For the first time in its existence the United Nations now has an ideal opportunity to build and maintain the world order for which the Organisation was created. To do so successfully  of course  requires commitment and adherence to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.The decisive manner in which the Security Council has gone about its business in recent weeks provides tangible evidence of the crucial and unique role of the United Nations in preserving world peace and security. For as grave as is the crisis in the Gulf  it has also provided an admirable opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which the international community can co-operate in the quest for peace and justice. It is to be hoped that this new-found spirit of co-operation will prevail on other occasions when the national interests of the super-Powers happen to coincide.Of course we fully support all the United Nations Security Council resolutions which  among other things  condemn Iraq's aggression  call for its immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and impose mandatory economic sanctions on the aggressor. Iraq's aggression not only is a threat to international peace and security  but also brings sharply into focus the inherent vulnerability of small States to assaults on their security  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and it points to the vital need small States have for the United Nations to safeguard their interests. It is thus critically important that the United Nations should prevail in the current crisis  not because this may be in the strategic interest of the  ore powerful nations but because what Iraq has done violates fundamental principles of international law which govern relations among States.If any good is to come from this crisis it is my Government’s fervent hope that  after the withdrawal of Iraqi forces and the restoration of the sovereignty of Kuwait  the Organisation will turn its urgent attention with equal vigour to finding a peaceful and comprehensive settlement of the outstanding conflicts in the Middle East.The new-found spirit of international political co-operation  marked by the decrease in ideological tensions  presents a golden opportunity for the powerful and industrially advanced States to bring about a major redistribution of resources in the creation of a new world order.However  we fear  with some justification  that the industrialised nations may be directing their attention internally  within the Worth  at the expense of the South. As the East-West divide narrows  the North-South gap seems to widen. And so we rewind the countries of the North that developing countries continue to face burdens such as the net outflow of resources  increasing trade protectionist  the reduction of concessionary and other financial flows  and ever-increasing oil prices. Unless the international community addresses these critical problem I fear that the international peace and security for which we all so desperately yearn will continue to elude us. Through new and creative solutions let us reap the dividends of our investment in peace - perhaps in different ways  but equitably distributed.While Barbados is concerned about the economic plight o£ developing countries in general  I take this opportunity to highlight some of our own special problems as a small  middle-income  inland  developing State. My country  Barbados  is excluded from the debt-relief programme of the international financial institutions because we were not classified as a least developed country. Other debt-reduction plans do not address our peculiar situation. Continued access to concessionary financing is being effectively denied us because of an over-emphasis on the gross national product (GDP) per capita criterion  precisely at a time when our economy faces great challenges. The irony is that we are being penalised for sound economic management.The Government of Barbados is of the view that а more dynamic and realistic approach to the provision of development assistance must be adopted. This should give due emphasis to the regional and subregional dimensions of development. For it has become abundantly clear that development will  in the final analysis  be fragile if the need for regional linkages  co-ordination and complementarily are not recognised. In addition  increased emphasis must be placed on enhancing the role of developing countries as suppliers of the inputs  both material and advisory  for regional technical assistance programmes funded by the United Nations.Perhaps no greater challenge faces mankind in the closing decade of this century than that of fostering environmentally sound economic development. This task has been entrusted  as it should be  to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Brazil in 1992. The success of the 1992 Conference will depend on our ability reach agreement on measures to e chance resource and technology transfers to developing countries. This is essential if developing countries are to be enabled to play their role in implementing more sustainable patterns of development. Today there is widespread international concern about the problem of drug trafficking. This concern was evident at the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly and at the seventeenth special session  devoted to international co-operation against illicit production  supply  demand  trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.It is the view of my delegation that one of the major advances at the seventeenth special session was the recognition that the demand for narcotic drugs is as deserving of concerted international action as the supply. Further emphasis was given to the demand component by the Declaration adopted at the World Ministerial Summit to Seduce the Demand for Drugs and to Combat the Cocaine Threat  held in London in April this year. We believe that the measures contained in the London Declaration will greatly complement the existing multilateral framework to combat drug abuse.In my country  Barbados  our Parliament this year passed new and extensive legislation to combat drug trafficking. Provision baa been made to forfeit and confiscate the drug-related assets of convicted drug offenders. Penalties for drug-related offences have been sharply increased and new offences relating to drug trafficking have been created. I am happy to report that Barbados will shortly accede to the Vienna Convention on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.It is my Government's belief that an indispensable condition for peace among nations and the rational development of the resources of this planet for the good of all peoples is the observance of human rights and democracy. It is for that reason that the government of Barbados pursues policies of creating and strengthening international instruments for the promotion of human rights. It is for that reason that the Government of Barbados will speak out wherever and whenever flagrant abuses of human rights and violent usurpations of democracy occur. It is also for that reason that we condemned the recent violent assault on the democratically elected Government of our sister republic of Trinidad and Tobago.In pursuance of our policy to support instruments that promote human rights  I am happy to announce that I have today deposited my country's instrument of ratification of the historic Convention on the Sights of the Child.Barbados looks forward also to the adoption of a Convention on the Protection of the Sights of all Migrant Workers and Their Families  so that thousands of men and women from developing countries who contract to work in foreign lands will be protected from exploitation and abuse.The international community is familiar with the efforts of the Haitian people to achieve social and economic progress within a stable democratic framework. The Heads of Government of Caribbean countries have  over the years  followed the situation in Haiti with deep concern for the welfare of the Haitian people. Caribbean Community Ministerial Missions and Working Groups of Senior Electoral Officers from Caribbean States have visited Haiti in the past year  seeking to help our sister Caribbean country in its efforts at democratisation and economic development. At their meeting in Jamaica  in July 1990  Reads of Government of Caribbean States reaffirmed their willingness to co-operate with the Government and people of Haiti  with the United Nations and with the Organisation of American States in providing assistance for the holding of free and fair elections in Haiti. The General Assembly at its forty-fifth session will be asked to consider a resolution co-sponsored by Caribbean and Latin American States requesting assistance with the electoral process in Haiti. We hope that that resolution will receive the unanimous support of this Assembly and that its provisions will be implemented without delay.Despite the serious threat to international peace and security currently confronting the world - indeed  ironically  almost because of it - the forty-fifth session of the Assembly has opened in an unprecedented atmosphere of optimism  expectation and confidence.At this critical juncture in history  States Members of the United Nations must use this momentum to forge a co-operative approach to the management of our planet Earth that addresses the root causes of conflict  inter alia the extreme economic and social inequalities between and within States  hunger  poverty and disease.Man  who has created the computer and conquered the moon  who has split the atom and decoded the gene  now has the chance in an age of entente to harness his creativity intelligently towards the development of the whole human family and towards the preservation and enhancement of the environment in which he lives. It is appropriate and necessary that the United Nations should take the lead in structuring the new agenda for development for all by the year 2000."
"22",1031,"BRN",45,1990,"﻿I should like to join other representatives in presenting my warm congratulations to Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta on his unanimous election as President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.I wish also to express our appreciation to the outgoing President Mr. Joseph H. Garba  and to the Secretary-General for providing us with leadership which has inspired confidence throughout the past year. At the same time Brunei Darussalam welcomes as members of this Organisation the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Republic of Namibia.Today is a special day for the world community. Brunei Darussalam would therefore like to take this early opportunity to extend its heartfelt congratulations to the German people on the momentous occasion of the unification of their homeland. We similarly congratulate the Republic of Yemen and the Yemeni people on their peaceful unification earlier this year. These events are the high points of a year in which a number of encouraging prospects have seemed to indicate that the political situation in the world is improving.At this Assembly last year we noted several of these positive signs. Since then w. have seen relations between the super-Powers become much less tense. This  in turn has led to a number of constructive meetings between previously hostile parties. At these meetings the broad principle o£ negotiation rather than confrontation has appeared to dominate. To this extent detente has been seen in action.As a result we have observed several pleasing initiatives. In our own region  we commend the continuing efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the other countries that are seeking a solution to the Cambodian problem. The level of accord reached thus far by the Cambodian parties over the framework document has been encouraging. Final agreement will be a considerable achievement  and we urge all concerned to bring this about.In the Korean peninsula  we have witnessed signs of reconciliation between two adversaries. This could lay the foundation for lasting peace between North and South. Following this  we hope that the application of either or both of them for membership of the United Nations will receive favourable consideration. We have noted moves towards the resolution of the Afghan conflict. These may encourage the Afghans to settle their disputes and start rebuilding their homeland.Finally  the independence of Namibia was an occasion of great joy to us all. It came about as the result of much hard work by the United Nations  and showed that this Organisation can be a powerful  active force for peace.These are positive examples of progress. They serve to convince us that the trend towards reconciliation and co-operation between the major Powers can assist us all. Above all  such progress can help to bring about control over the flow of arms  a reduction in the excessive level of weaponry  and regulation of the transfer of arms technology. It may thus permit us to look forward realistically to a time when the arms race has been halted throughout the world. Nevertheless  at present  there appears to be only moral force to protect us against violations of the United Nations Charter. Therefore our hopes for the future are linked to the belief that it is crucial that the role of the United Nations in the resolution of international disputes be enhanced.In that way  Brunei Darussalam believes  members of the international community can contribute to a détente that is world-wide by encouraging regional organisations to co-operate with one another in support of the principles and Charter of the United Nations. Regional organisations may thus begin to emerge as significant forces for the protection of global peace and security. It is by engaging in such new roles that the major Powers may place their own hard-won détente at the service of world-wide peace.It is important  however  to recognise that detente is not to be judged solely from the perspective of Europe. Peace and stability is the concern of all regions. Therefore  while acknowledging a number of positive moves towards the creation of a safer world  we detect grave tendencies that threaten world-wide peace.In particular  we observe contradictory trends. These reveal that traditional security  which in European countries may have begun to assume a less dominant character  is still a matter of considerable concern to the rest of the world. At a time when developed nations are more free to concentrate on welfare and even more development we face the disturbing fact that less developed countries are engaged in an arms race of their own.The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is a demonstration of how vulnerable small nations can be in the face of such contradiction. It also reminds us how fragile the newly emerging global order is. Thus  in urging the international community to reject and condemn such acts  and in expressing its own condemnation of all such violations of the United Nations Charter  Brunei Darussalam not only notes current events but also recognises their deep-seated causes.Hence  we draw the attention of the Members of this Organisation once more to specific regional matters. These  we believe  are often the deep-seated cause of wider conflict.In this respect  we refer to the core problem of Palestine. Brunei Darussalam reiterates its total condemnation of Israeli policy in that country with regard both to the actions of the Israeli army and to policy relating to the immigration of Soviet Jews. We therefore wish to record again our support for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East  involving the permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We refer to South Africa  where the complete and irreversible dismantling of apartheid has yet to be brought about.We refer similarly to matters of great global importance  such as damage to the environment  the problem of debt  international drug-trafficking and underdevelopment. These are no less threatening to peace than arc acts of open hostility. Although initiatives taken in these areas have afforded us cautious optimism  other problems remain unsolved and must be addressed with even greater urgency. Only when that is done can we hope to see the emergence of a world that all nations  regardless of their size  geographic location or level of economic development  regard as prosperous and stable.Today I have stressed that an era of peace  stability and prosperity cannot be fashioned solely from the viewpoint of one region of the world  no matter how powerful that region may be. This means that we cannot be complacent. The global peace and stability that we all seek is certainly promoted by the climate of East-West detente that has developed during the past year. However  it will not emerge for the benefit of all unless we strive together to prevent new problems and to solve the many long-standing ones that have been shown to threaten the very existence of many nations and their people. "
"23",1073,"BTN",45,1990,"﻿I have the honour to convey to you. Sir  and through you to all representatives the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King of Bhutan  for the success of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly.I should like to take this opportunity to extend to you the warm congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Given your wisdom and experience  Ī am confident that you will guide our deliberations to successful conclusions. I should also like to put on record our appreciation for the skilful manner in which Mr. Joseph N. Garba conducted the proceedings of our last session.The comprehensive and incisive annual report of our Secretary-General deserves our highest commendation. People all over the world have c witnessed with gratification the potential of the United Nations and the realisation of the high hopes they place in it. That renaissance of consciousness in the Organisation is in large measure due to the unrelenting efforts of the Secretary-General and his senior colleagues in the United Nations system.We are indeed living in challenging times. The rolling tide of change has reached unprecedented heights. Physical walls that divided peoples and nations have been reduced to rubble. Ideological barriers have been dismantled. Mistrust and hatred have given way to understanding and co-operation. Years of hostility between the super-Powers and their allies have ended. A truly new epoch has begun in their bilateral relations. In a remarkably short span of time  the world has seen an irreversible trend towards reconciliation between nations that not very long ago were bitter foes. Ws must encourage that growing trend towards reconciliation to ensure enduring global peace and progress. The recent changes of historic proportion have led to an unprecedented integration of Europe. The unification of Germany  which we heartily welcome  has become a reality. We are confident that a strong and united Germany will make valuable contributions to Europe and the world. All this has opened up new opportunities for growth and development in the world. The positive fallout of the improved super-Power relations is also evident in the narrowing of differences in many regional conflicts and  in some cases  in their resolution.Namibia is one telling example. Its independence and accession to membership of the United Nations early this year were the logical culmination of the long-drawn-out struggle against colonialism. Even in South Africa   a new beginning has been made. The release of Nelson Mandela has effectively set in motion the inevitable process towards freedom  equity and justice. We hope the commencement of negotiations for a new constitution embracing power-sharing will soon lead to the establishment of a united  non-racial South Africa. Until much time as apartheid is abolished and a representative government assumes office  my delegation supports the continuation of economic sanctions.The spirit of growing co-operation in international relations is evident in the fact that the five permanent members of the Security Council are joining hands to end the Cambodian tragedy. We appreciate their initiative and the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in the search for a lasting solution to the Cambodian problem. The framework defining key elements for a comprehensive political settlement agreed to by the five permanent members and subsequently endorsed by the concerned parties as the basis for settling the problem during the Jakarta Meeting gives cause for optimism. We welcome the establishment of the Supreme national Council as a prelude to restoring the country's independence and territorial integrity under a truly representative government. The situation in Afghanistan is being viewed with realism. The internal in-fighting resulting from the interplay of outside interests and counter-interests had relegated the concerns and sensitivities of the people of Afghanistan to the periphery and undermined the Geneva Agreements. We welcome the recent initiative of the two super-Powers to end the stalemate and we support any effort that will usher in a broad-based Government and bring about an effective and lasting solution to the problem. As the cold war draws to an end and the United Nations is set to play its central role in promoting international peace and co-operation  the time has come for the United Nations to settle the last remaining legacy of the cold war - the issue of Korea's membership in the United Nations. In today's international community  the Republic of Korea is the only country that remains outside the United Nations in spite of its strong desire to become a Member. The Republic of Korea has become an important member of the world community  maintaining diplomatic relations with 143 countries and enjoying full membership in most of the international organizations  including 15 specialized agencies of the United Nations. In our view  the admission of the Republic of Korea to United Nations membership should be determined strictly on the merits of the case and in accordance with the membership criteria set forth in the Charter. The question of the Republic of Korea's membership should not be subjected to extraneous considerations such as the resolution of inter-Korean issues. My delegation therefore strongly supports the admission of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations as a Member.Peace and diplomacy  however  have not prevailed in the Middle East. Just as the world was beginning to trust and appreciate the emerging international order based on the rule of law  the confidence of the international community was rudely shaken by recent events in the Middle East. The blatant use of force by Iraq to settle its dispute with Kuwait is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and the basic principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and is contrary to all norms of international behaviour. Respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of States are the cardinal principles governing relations among nations. Unless Iraq is made to disgorge its ill-gotten gains through the economic embargo and whatever other means the United Nations considers appropriate  no small State in the world will be safe in the future. And let us not forget that the vast majority of United Nations Members are small States.The manner in which the Gulf crisis is resolved will determine how the international political order will be maintained in the post-cold-war world. In that context  it was heartening to hear the United Nations speak with one voice when confronted with that great challenge. Squally significant was the first joint crisis-management exercise by the super-Powers. That is manifest in the various Security Council resolutions that have been adopted and which we fully support. At last we have seen the Security Council emerge from the shackles of the cold war to play its role as envisaged by the founding fathers. My country has joined other peace-loving nations of the world in condemning Iraq's aggression and calling for its immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. We do not recognize the Iraqi annexation of the State of Kuwait  We uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and its legitimate Government of His Highness Sheikh Jaber AI-Ahmad AI-Sahah  Amir of Kuwait. We call upon Iraq to abide by the Security Council resolutions and settle its differences with Kuwait by peaceful means through dialogue and negotiation.The first crisis of the post-cold-war era is a sobering shock. Must the world order so assiduously built over the years disintegrate in one misadventure? This calls for some mechanisms designed not only to settle disputes but also to anticipate and prevent conflicts. In his 1939 report on the work of the Organization  our Secretary-General said: ""Efforts to prevent possible conflicts  reduce the risk of war and achieve definitive settlements of disputes  whether long-standing or new  are part and parcel of a credible strategy for peace."" (A 44 1  p. 10) Those wise words merit our unconditional support. We believe the United Nations should play a central role in creating this collective security structure. In this connection  we fully support the proposal by the Foreign Minister of the USSR  Mr. Shevardnadze  to reactivate the work of the Security Council's Military Staff Committee. Such a body would not only enable the United Nations to enforce its decisions but provide a mechanism for preparing and co-ordinating action.To digress slightly  I wish to express our deep appreciation and admiration for the brilliant address by Mr. Shevardnadze at the current session of the General Assembly. His perceptive and visionary remarks do credit to him and his great leader  President Gorbachev  who through their great statesmanship have done more than anyone else to usher in a new and more humane political order in the world.The saga of the Palestinian people's struggle for justice and freedom continues. For almost three years the intifadah has survived against all odds and become a symbol of the resurgence of Palestinian nationalism. The world cannot afford to ignore it  much less deny it. My country has always supported the right of all nations in the region to live in peace within secure borders. This applies equally to the Palestinian people  who have every right to an independent homeland. In our view  the present Gulf crisis once again underscores the urgent necessity for settling the Palestine question. Unless this is done  the Middle East  with its vast oil reserves  will remain a constant threat to world peace and stability. In this regard  we call for the early convening of an international conference for the settlement of the Palestine question.The theory of containment and deterrence has lost much of its appeal and relevance. As the paranoia and misconceptions prevalent in the super-Power relations during the cold war have disappeared  the entire perception of their traditional security arrangements has undergone a dramatic change. They are now engaged in a highly constructive dialogue on disarmament  dispelling the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Sadly  however  while the super-Powers' dialogue has entered a productive phase  it is ironic that there should be a drive by many countries to increase their arsenals of war. Apart from the uncertainty over the extent of nuclear arms proliferation  definite evidence of the acquisition of chemical and bacteriological weapons by a large number of countries has emerged. Equally unfortunate is the massive diversion of resources by the developing countries for military expenditure at the cost of the basic needs of their peoples.The thaw in the cold war and the expected peace dividend offer the opportunity to underscore once again the relationship between disarmament and development. The time is now opportune to reduce defence expenditure and divert the financial and other productive resources to the solution of urgent global problems. We hope the international community will give meaning and substance to the concept of development through disarmament and not use the present uncertainties to restore defence expenditure. In this spirit  we reiterate our call to convene a fourth special session on disarmament.Many hold the view that the achievements in the political arena have not been matched in the field of economic co-operation. The world economy still dismays pervasive uncertainties. The wall that divides the developed and the developing countries is firmly in place. Their relations continue to be affected by severe disparities and inequities. We  however  believe that there is reason not to despair  developments over the past year have opened up new and exciting opportunities. The increasing co-operation between major Powers  the integration of Eastern European countries into the world economic system and the relatively peaceful international climate have generated a greater willingness to deal with the problems of the current world economic system.The consensus to convene a World Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992 and the establishment of the Preparatory Committee indicate a convergence of views among Member States on the vital question of environment. The urgent need for collective action is supported by a great deal of scientific evidence on the diminishing capacity of the environment to sustain life. These environmental challenges are no longer confined to nations or regions but global in scope  threatening the very survival of humanity. Indeed it is only the strength of our resolve to transcend our narrow national interests and act in global unity and harmony that will determine the fate of future generations. We hope the 1992 Conference in Brazil will be a watershed in international collective efforts to repair the damage and redress the ecological imbalances that threaten our fragile planet. The World Summit for Children was a highly significant  vent  for it was a reaffirmation of our obligations under the United Nations Charter ""to save succeeding generations"". The Summit was a solemn occasion to rediscover this truth and realign our focus on the needs of the children. It was also a recognition that human resource is both a means and an end to development. The joint commitment reflected in the Declaration provides a concrete step in ensuring the survival and well-being of children as a measure of successful development efforts. May I take this opportunity to commend the dedicated executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund  Mr. Grant  for his untiring crusade on behalf of the world's children.My delegation is happy at the outcome of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris recently. Although the Programme of Action adopted for the 19908 has not fully met the expectations of the least developed countries  the international community has made a strong commitment to arrest the further deterioration in their socio-economic situation and to reactivate and accelerate growth and development in those countries and to set them firmly on the path of sustained growth. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to urge the donor community to translate its commitments in Paris into concrete action. We have every confidence that the national effort  of the least developed countries  supplemented by adequate financial and technical assistance from the donors  will accelerate economic growth and improve the quality of life of the copies in the least developed countries by the end of this decade.The road to development has not been smooth and easy for the Kingdom of Bhutan. One of our main national development objectives is economic self-reliance. In its realisation we face not only all the constraints of a least developed country but also the geographical handicap of being landlocked. Our remoteness from the sea adds to the high cost of transportation of all our goods and services. The creation of an internal transport and communications network in our rugged terrain to maintain an effective national link constitutes a formidable challenge. Given our situation  external assistance will thus continua to play a major role in our modernisation process  although it is our intention to keep such assistance to the bare minimum.Here I wish to acknowledge the useful contribution of our development partners  particularly India  Japan  Switzerland  Denmark  Austria  Norway  the United Kingdom  Australia and the Federal Republic of Germany  and various specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations  particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)  the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)  the World Health Organization (HĦ0)  the World Food Programme (WFP)  the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  the United Nations Volunteers (UNV)  the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)  the United Nations Department of Technical Co-operation for Development (UNDICD) and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  in the realization of our development goals. They have played an active part in all aspects of our national life and moved us closer to our objective of economic self-reliance.The 1990s is the decade of the future. What is done and left undone now will determine the quality of life in the future and perhaps even the very survival of mankind. Most propitiously  the recent past has seen great forces of reform and rethinking at work in international life. The notion that the United Nations was a theatre of debate rather than consensus  rich in rhetoric and poor in action  has been proved wrong. Even in the most compelling circumstances the United Nations has continued to be the navigating light  however dim  shining in the darkness  guiding mankind's path away from destruction. Multilateralism has provided effective answers to the many ills of our times. The United Nations has now re-emerged as the conscience of the world. It is certainly our best hope for the future. We must do everything possible to preserve and strengthen it for the sake of global peace and security  and for the well-being of all our peoples. "
"24",1114,"BWA",45,1990,"﻿Allow me  Sir  at the outset to extend to you most sincerely the congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under your wise and experienced leadership this session will be a successful one.It is with a great sense of pride that I salute your predecessor for his very creative and productive stewardship of the forty-fourth session. The adoption by consensus of the historic Declaration on Apartheid  the Convention on the Sights of the Child  and others carries the imprint of his inspired leadership of that session. We owe him a heavy debt of gratitude.Under the steady  wise  careful and purposeful leadership of our Secretary-General  the United Nations has continued to make impressive strides in the quest for peace in our troubled world. A few months ago  we welcomed into the family of our world Organisation the new  independent State of Namibia  free and sovereign at last  thanks to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar's tenacity of purpose. We salute the Secretary-General.I join those who spoke before me in extending to the Principality of Liechtenstein a warm welcome into the family of the United Nations. The addition of a Member to our Organization adds another step in its progress towards universality.The orderly evolution of a logic of peace in international relations has continued to gather momentum despite intermittent spasms of crisis and conflict that occasionally threaten to restore the old order. The cold war can now safely be pronounced dead and buried. The Second World War has at long last lost its residual vestiges with the termination of the four allied Powers' troubled superintendency over Germany. Germany has been reunited. We share the joy of its people.Polarised ideological lines between and among nations have become blurred  if not anachronistic  λ new epoch in the march of our common history has begun in earnest. In the words of the Secretary-General ""As we survey the political scene  we see the dawn of a new era in Europe  streaks of light in some regions and the darkness of old animosities and new hatreds enveloping others."" (A 4Ş 1. p. 3)In Eastern Europe  we continue to be touched by the infectious spirit of renewal which has manifested itself in the inexorable resurgence of democratic pluralism. There has been pain and suffering in some of these dramatic developments  but  increasingly  the message they all convey is one of reconciliation and hope. We salute the architects of these positive developments and wish them well as they settle down to design new ways of life for their societies and fashion a new age for their beloved Europe.The rest of our troubled world is opt happy yet. Bloody civil wars have continued to unleash their all-consuming fury on innocent populations in many lands. Regional conflicts have yet to become a thing o£ the past  despite the end of the cold war from which they have often in the past derived their fuel  their raisons d'être. There is enough reason to hope  however  that the relaxation of tension between the East and the Vest will have a catalytic effect on the search for solutions to these conflicts. The guns of these wasteful conflicts  which have for so far been sowing death and destruction in Africa  Asia and Latin America  must be silenced. The situation in Afghanistan pains us a great deal. Why should Afghanistan continue to bleed so much  after the removal of foreign troops  which this Assembly demanded for almost a decade? The answer is that some parties to that tragic conflict have not shown any faith in the efficacy of the Geneva Agreements  having chosen a military solution to settle the conflict. This Assembly roust insist on the implementation of the Agreements.In South-East Asia  the intractable problem of Cambodia is now ripe for solution  if the very laudable efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council can be nurtured to fruition. A national supreme council comprising the leaders of the warring factions has been established to administer the country during the implementation of a United Nations plan. This positive development represents a precious opportunity  not to be wasted in political posturing and wrangling. Cambodia and its people have suffered long enough.Botswana welcomes the steps  however tentative  that have recently been taken by the two parts of Korea towards reconciliation and mutual accommodation. The recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea  it is to be hoped  signals the beginning of the end to the division of Korea  and the ushering in of a new era of reconciliation and peace for that troubled peninsula. We urge the two sides to deploy every effort to reunite their country.There has still been no movement of note on the Cyprus question. We urge the parties to intensify their efforts  taking advantage of the increasingly effective good offices of the Secretary-General  to find a lasting solution to this vexing question.We had all hoped that the end of the eight-year-long war between Iran and Iraq would usher in a new era of peace and stability in the Gulf. Our hopes have been shattered. The Gulf has once again become a cockpit of violent conflict. The brutal invasion and annexation of the small  peaceful Kingdom of Kuwait by Iraq has shocked us all. The invasion has had very serious reverberations all over the world  in keeping with the very sensitive nature of the Gulf area  a war psychosis has been stirred up over the crisis  with unpredictable consequences.The ghastly reality of tens of thousands of foreign nationals who had been working and living peacefully in both Kuwait and Iraq and who suddenly find themselves stranded in the desert without food or shelter is an outrage to our humanity  to say the least. Even worse is the possible fate of those foreign nationals who remain in Iraq as hostages or human shields; or  worse still  of those who might be held hostage to hunger and starvation.Iraq must heed the voice of reason  vacate Kuwait and restore its independence and sovereignty as demanded by resolutions of the Security Council  which Botswana fully supports. Aggression must not be allowed to pay.It is our fervent hope that the crisis can still be resolved peacefully  for we shudder to contemplate the consequences of a violent solution. We hope that the leaders of Iraq will  sooner rather than later  find the wisdom and courage to extricate their country from the strait-jacket of defiance and bellicosity in which they have placed it. The fortunes and misfortunes of the Gulf are  of course  intertwined with those of the Middle East as a whole. The area remains one of endemic conflict and intractable problems. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait exacerbates this unhappy state of affairs.The bloody revolution of frustration that has been raging in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has now assumed the characteristics of a quiet  forgotten revolution. The Gulf crisis has become the dominant news item  and occupies the front burner of international concern and preoccupation. And yet  the Palestinian question remains very much alive and cries to the heavens for a solution. Nothing will deter the Palestinian people from continuing to yearn and struggle for a homeland of their ova  and as long as this is the case  there will be no peace  no security and no stability in the Middle East  either for Israel or for its neighbours.Botswana continues to hope that Israel will find the wisdom and courage to negotiate a lasting solution with the genuine leaders of the people of Palestine. Israel must  for the sake of its own survival  come to terms with the aspirations of the Palestinian people.In Latin America  the Falklands issue remains unresolved  even though relations between the contending parties have improved considerably. It is our hope that the United Kingdom and Argentina will use these improved relations to negotiate an end to their dispute over the Falklands. The dispute cannot be wished away or ignored. The longer it is ignored  the more it will haunt and bedevil the peace and stability of the South Atlantic.The brutal civil war goes on in El Salvador  War and suffering have become a way of life in that troubled country  and will remain so as long as the parties to that tragic conflict cannot stop the bloodshed and come to terms with the wrongs and injustices of their common past  and seek amicable solutions to them. The people of El Salvador deserve the peace envisaged for them and other Central American nations in Esquipulas II.Let me now come closer to home. When we met here last year at the forty-fourth session  Mr. Nelson Mandela was still in prison. Prospects for change in South Africa were very dim. South Africa was still set in its violent and cruel ways  unrelieved even by the appearance on the political scene of α new loader of the National Party  whose statements seemed to convey a message of hope to a hopeless and desperate nation.A year later  South Africa looks different. Mr. Mandela and his life-sentence colleagues have been released. Scores of other political prisoners have also regained their freedom. Two crucial talks between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Government have been held - in Cape Town in May and in Pretoria in August - and have been pronounced a success.The dramatic opening of a chink in the citadel of apartheid by President F. W. de Klerk on 2 February 1990 had been preceded by the adoption of the historic Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa by the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Adopted by consensus  an historic achievement by itself  the Declaration states in paragraph 1:""A conjuncture of circumstances exists  which  if there is a demonstrable readiness on the part of the South African regime to engage in negotiations genuinely and seriously  given the repeated expression of the majority of the people of South Africa of their long-standing preference to arrive at a political settlement  could create the possibility to end apartheid through negotiations."" The Cape Town and Pretoria Minutes  two of the most promising manifestations of the possibility of a negotiated and peaceful end to apartheid and its repressive structures  have changed the face of South Africa. The Minutes have not ended that tragic country's reputation for brutality and violence. They have not created the requisite atmosphere for full-fledged negotiations  and yet in a very real sense  the South African tragedy is ripe for solution  as never before  even in spite of the recent wave of violence.Pretoria has gone some way in the implementation of the Declaration on Apartheid. The report of the Secretary-General  contained in document A 44 960 of 1 July 1990  gives credence to this assessment. Mandela and several other prisoners have been freed. The state of emergency has been lifted  except in Natal. Some apartheid laws  among them the Separate Amenities Act  have been repealed. Hospitals have been desegregated. And  finally  promises and assurances for more affirmative action on the remaining repressive 1шг have been made  particularly through the medium of AKC-Government talks.""The prospect of a non-racial democracy in South Africa in the not-too-distant future is no longer unrealistic."" (A 4S 1. p. As observes the Secretary-General in his incisive report on the work of our Organization. Indeed  all the leaders of South Africa  black and white alike  stand poised face to face with their most fateful moment of truth. A golden opportunity to collaborate in the shaping of a new South Africa has been landed on their lap. The opportunity must not be wasted. Thus far  the ongoing exploratory talks have been limited to two parties  the AMC and the National Party. The other parties have been derisive  hostile or dismissive about the talks  describing them as a sell-out  a charade or capitulation by the AMC.Wisely  the AMC has made it clear that it does not consider itself the anointed and sole representative and spokesman of black South Africans. Mr. Mandela has called for the formation of a broad front of the black leadership to face the leaders of the  white community ate the  conference table. We fully support that call; because in unity there is always strength  and black South Africa needs unity and strength.The violence now ravaging the lives of hundreds of innocent people  black people  in the townships  must be dealt with by a black leadership that is united in purpose and determined in its commitment to the realisation of the new South Africa we all seek. The new South Africa cannot be brought about in pools of innocent blood spilt by the crude weapons of tribalism  political factionalism and thuggery. Such a state of affairs can only retard  if not thwart  the process of change in South Africa.This applies also to those in the white community whose ""invisible hand"" might be busy stoking the fires of a racial conflagration in a pernicious attempt to preserve the status quo. The onus is on the South African Government to seek out this invisible hand and cut it off to save the gains that have thus far been made in the guest for a new South Africa.We are very worried that some elements in the South African police  encouraged and abetted by the right wing  may have thrown in their lot with those who seek to preserve the status quo at all costs  and are thus bent on ensuring that President de Klerk and Mandela are impeded in their efforts to prepare South Africa for change.We are  nevertheless  convinced that change in South Africa is inevitable. The first bold steps towards a new South Africa have been taken. The United Nations and the world at large have encouraged peaceful change in the country  and must continue to do so. In the final analysis  however  the destiny of South Africa can be shaped only by its people. The people of Angola have suffered long enough. The civil war there is: as senseless as ever. We are  however  encouraged by reports of progress in the ¡recent talks between the Angolan Government and UNITA. It is hoped that the parties will declare a ceasefire and commence negotiations for a peaceful resolution of their conflict.Angola's tragedy is Mozambique's tragedy. In Mozambique  too  an utterly senseless and brutal civil war has been wreaking unspeakable havoc on that war-weary country. The Government has long shown its readiness to negotiate with the rebels  who  unfortunately  have thus far failed to demonstrate any serious intention to respond positively. We urge those who still give sustenance to NENAMOČ for whatever reason  to desist and thus save the people of Mozambique more senseless mayhem and bloodshed.	So long as the question of Western Sahara remains unresolved it cannot in reality be said that with Namibia's accession to independence in March this year Africa has rid itself of all vestiges of colonialism.Fortunately  the way now seems to be clear for a solution that will end  once and for all  the painful colonial limbo in which the people of Western Sahara have been wallowing ever since the abdication of their former colonial Power. The Secretary-General's report of 18 June 1990  contained in document S 21360  is encouraging indeed  containing  as it does  the rudiments of a proposal for the resolution of the Western Sahara question. It is our fervent hope that the parties will co-operate fully with the United Nations Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity to develop and implement the proposals without delay.As East-West tension gives way to global co-operation  the challenge now is how to take advantage of this climate for the benefit of all mankind. There are major challenges regarding means to safeguard the global environment in such a way that it can continue to sustain development far into the future  and also how to bridge the ever-increasing gap between the rich North and the poor South. We should now be able to direct more attention and effort towards increasing the well-being of our people.In this context  we are encouraged to note that the dialogue towards realising these objectives is already under way. The United Nations special session on international economic co-operation and the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which was held recently  focused on issues such as our ever-increasing indebtedness and falling commodity prices. The lack of stability in the pricing of our commodities has made our products highly risky ones around which to plan our development. The crisis in the Gulf and the resultant sharp movements in oil prices will only compound the problem.Our efforts to prime our economies will be to no avail unless the international community takes bold steps to address these problems  which are seriously affecting our development efforts.We remain hopeful that the reduced defence spending in the industrialized world will release significant funds for foreign aid and that a fair portion of the so-called peace dividend will be channelled to the least-developed countries.In addition to the two conferences that I have just mentioned  a conference on development in Africa was held in Maastricht  Holland  in June this year. This conference  which was co-chaired by the President of the Republic of Botswana and Mr. Robert McNamara  former President of the World Bank  addressed the economic problems facing sub-Saharan Africa. It was agreed that the development of Africa is a long-term process and that it must be a human-centred process. The achievement of food security and assured universal access to health care and to education and employment opportunities must be the primary objective of this process. The war against the scourge of narcotic drugs and their consequences is far from won. Demand for these dangerous drugs is as insatiable as ever  while the supply continues  unabated and inexhaustible. But we cannot afford to be daunted  for that would be tantamount to acquiescing in the needless destruction of generations of young people - mostly young people - who are being lost in ever-increasing numbers to an insidious drug culture. Those within whose borders drugs ore produced must spare no effort to eradicate production  while those within whose borders the drugs are consumed must spare no effort to eradicate demand.The adoption  on 30 September 1990  of the Declaration on the Survival  Protection and Development of Children represents a momentous milestone in the history of mankind. For the first time there is a universal commitment to the welfare of the child  to which Botswana is very proud to subscribe. The Botswana Government has always placed the plight of children at the top of the agenda of priorities in the formulation of its development policies. In Botswana  education - from primary school to university - is free. Current statistics indicate that 85 per cent of our children have access to formal education  at least at the primary level.Botswana has also taken important strides in the provision of adequate health facilities. These have resulted  during the period since 1980  in a rapid reduction in the child mortality rate. In 1988 the immunization rate reached 98 per cent  and in the case of malnutrition the figure has now been reduced to under 1 per cent. Our commitment to primary health care remains the top priority in our development strategies.Botswana has subscribed to the Convention on the Bights of the Child  which was adopted last year at the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Together  the Convention and the Declaration on the Survival  Protection and Development of Children constitute a formidable foundation on which the future of our world's children can  and must  be securely constructed. It is our cherished hope that the spirit of 30 September 1990 will stiffen the resolve of nations to join forces to combat poverty  illiteracy  disease and unbridled population growth and thus create a hotter and safer world for our children.The United Nations - this repository of the hopes and aspirations of mankind - has entered a new era. All those who have already spoken in this debate waxed poetic about the indestructible virtues of our Charter  to which  without exception  they reaffirmed their unswerving fidelity and commitment. They spoke eloquently about their determination to infuse the Organisation with a new dynamism  a new mission  a new sense of purpose. Botswana shares fully those expressions of renewed faith and confidence in an Organisation that  only a year ago  was reviled as an empty symbol  He  too  reaffirm our faith in it. It is our fervent hope that  in particular  the Security Council's new-found vitality  so amply demonstrated by the unusual facility and rapidity with which it has been reacting to the crisis in the Gulf  will be ardently sustained and replicated in respect of other crises.

"25",1158,"CAF",45,1990,"﻿The current international backdrop to this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  which was founded in 1945 out of the ashes of the Second World War so as to prevent any recurrence of war  has brought our institution closer to its original purposes and principles than ever before.This unprecedented moment  which we trust will leave its lasting and indelible mark on the human spirit and on the conduct of nations  is characterized by the following! growing awareness of States of their interdependence; the will  and henceforth the collective resolve of States  to try to improve their mutual relations by way of dialogue  harmony and co-operation; and the slow but persistent efforts to establish a new world order better suited to take account of the values of freedom  democracy  ideological openness and economic and social development.The admission of the Republic of Namibia to membership in our Organisation attests to the major changes occurring today and confers upon the Assembly the further prestige that has so long been awaited.I am here today to express the Central African Republic's deep desire to see this new effort by the community of nations to bring greater serenity to international relations take root  and at the same time to state my country's concerns over the serious uncertainties still weighing over the future of mankind and jeopardising the developments in progress.Before doing so  I should like first to extend to the Republic of Namibia and to the Principality of Liechtenstein the warmest congratulations of the Central African Republic on their admission to membership in the United Nations; this has brought the goal of universality of our Organisation closer to realisation. My country extends to its sister Republic  Namibia  its best wishes for success and prosperity in building up the nation  and trusts that the same spirit of collective solidarity it earned by the nobility and maturity of its struggle for independence will be turned to the advantage of the new State.I extend my country's thanks to Mr. Joseph Garba for the successful way in which he carried out his mandate as President of the Assembly at its last session  and I express my deep conviction that this session will be equally successful  given your outstanding qualities and your mastery of the international scene.His Excellency General André Kolingba  President of the Republic  Head of State  provided eloquent proof of his constant faith in the objectives and ideals of the United Nations by taking part personally in the World Summit for Children. In that spirit  he extends his warm wishes for the success of the Assembly's work  and once again reaffirms his deep gratitude to the Secretary-General of our Organisation for his tireless and unceasing commitment to restoring to the United Nations the political and moral authority it needs to handle multilateralism in a world in the throes of change.In response to the long-frustrated wishes of the majority of peoples on the planet that the infernal cycle of the arms race should be brought to a halt  there has bloomed a new spirit of detente  compromise  concertation and co-operation  whose most obvious effects are now being seen in all aspects of the relations almost all States maintain with each other. This spirit is one cast in the form of a modern-day crusade in two directions: reducing the likelihood of military confrontations; and thawing out the ideological competition.The resurgence of interest in restoring international peace and security which this demonstrates is reflected in the desire to redress several situations in which there is latent or explosive tension that  through their persistence  have for a long time tended to destabilize international relations. The main examples of this resurgence are:The achievement of significant results in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union towards reducing their nuclear arsenals. These are most praiseworthy efforts  which should be taken up by other countries  in order to render meaningless the balance of terror on which relations between States have so far been based;The beginning of a fruitful dialogue in South Africa  the final stage of which will necessarily involve the eradication of apartheid  the advent of a democratic society  and the more harmonious coexistence of all the States of the subregion;The initiatives at the world and subregional levels to find  by means of law alone  a settlement to the frontier dispute between Chad and Libya  and to put an end to the devastating consequences of the situations still prevailing in Angola  Western Sahara  Liberia  Cyprus  Afghanistan  Cambodia  El Salvador and Guatemala;The unanimous reaction of the international community that Iraq should abide by the principles of international law violated by its invasion and annexation of Kuwait;The constructive attitude evinced by the concert of nations over the reunification of Yemen and of Germany. Here  we would salute the far-sightedness of those who brought this reunification about.The Central African Republic  which has always made dialogue for peace the basic principle of its domestic and foreign policies  welcomes the renewed interest shown by States' collective and resolute crusade for the great trends underpinning  through compromise and concertation  the preservation of world security. In Lebanon  sovereignty and territorial integrity have not yet been fully recovered. Israel has a right to a legal existence in a context of peaceful coexistence with the other States in the region. Palestine's dream of a national homeland should cease to be vain and illusory. In the Korea peninsula  the effects of international détente should lead to a quickening by the two States of an independent and peaceful reunification process.All those situations  by the risks and dangers they entail  are severely limiting the hopes born of the crusade of which I spoke; that crusade is to a great degree selective  defending the major and immediate interests of the great nations of the world.Allied to the crusade for peace  since the winds of freedom have become a constant in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the democratic movement has established itself  there has been a second type of crusade  one directed towards making respect for democratic values and for human rights a universal model. The Central African Republic  while recognizing the inadequacies of the approach  which has often generated confusion about the nobility of the objective  has since 1981 endorsed those concerns of the international community  through the leadership of General Kolingba  President of the Republic and Head of State.The state of law now in force goes hand-in-hand with a political philosophy of patience and tolerance  and includes a multitude of areas: apart from the traditional separation of the executive  the legislature and the judiciary  there are the multiplicity of candidates in free and democratic elections; freedom of speech; freedom ι ; movement; proscription of arbitrary acts and degrading treatments; harmony and concord between all sectors of the population; and open dialogue with civilian society - in short  human rights receive greater protection and more guarantees. These immense democratic gains  which are unprecedented in the history of the Central African Republic  are to be consolidated and expanded by the next congress of our party  the Central African Democratic Assembly; it will do so in strict conformity with the attitudes and characteristics of the Central African people's civilisation.Democracy  which is a product of history and of the state of mind of peoples  by reason of its many demands requires of nations an equally determined crusade for development. The never-equalled contribution of the Western States to those of the East  made with a view to stabilising the democratic advances there  is in this respect indicative of the spirit of solidarity we expect the world to show the States of Africa  Asia and Latin America  which are facing the harsh trials of destitution and poverty  and are going under  while the North turns a blind eye. The last issue  which is truly crucial to the future of international relations  is the question of the situation of the poorest countries in the world. That situation  which has often been mentioned from this rostrum  is worsening as the years pass by.There is enormous uncertainty in this area at this time because although there is an encouraging shift towards economic recovery in the developed countries at this time of economic crisis which is disrupting the world  most developing countries  particularly those in Africa  are still suffering greatly from the impact of this economic crisis.The development programmes of many of those countries  such as the Central African Republic  have been crushed  under the joint impact of the adverse factors of a continuing drop in commodity prices - and their economies largely depend on commodities - under the burden of debt and because of the negative net transfer of capital away from them.Despite the real efforts and the sacrifices made  often at enormous cost  to take initiatives for development  nothing that would really promote continuing and lasting economic progress has really been achieved. The growth rate is still close to aero in these countries  and this is a point that was made in the World Bank  report for 1989 on development in the world.The hopes born at the time of the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development have given place to apprehension in the face of the rather selective and limited implementation of the programme by the developed countries. This also shows that there has been a drop in multilateralism despite the assurances resulting from the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  held last April. New initiatives and new Measures must be envisaged at a time when the burden of the consequences of the situation in the Arab-Persian Gulf has to be taken into account so that these countries are not excluded from development definitively.What is needed are appropriate programmes that would transform the productive structures and create conditions for sustained and lasting economic progress and that would thus lead to a resumption of economic growth and development in those countries. In fact  these are precisely the conclusions arrived at the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which was held recently in Paris. The Central African Republic welcomed that Conference  in particular because it is itself a developing  land-locked and least developed country.My delegation hopes that the Declaration adopted at the end of that Conference and the 12 measures announced in support of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s will  in fact  be given practical effect on the basis of a stronger partnership so that these countries will have the bases for sustained and lasting development.Given the interdependence between the developing and the developed countries  we would also like to see greater solidarity and more dynamism so as to promote the mutual search for the conditions required for prosperity and development for all.The proposal by Senegal  India  Venezuela and Egypt for resumption of the North-South dialogue is part of this overall approach  and we would like to see it implemented.If we are to have this world of solidarity  which recognises the values of peace  democracy and development  which we all whole-heartedly long for  then we have to find solutions to all the pending problems. In addition  what is needed is that States endeavour to work for these values so that the values may spread throughout the world. If the uncertainties in international relations today reflect the limits of States’ commitments to these values in their mutual relations  than these values  which underlie the international community  will not survive for long.This session  which is the forty-fifth anniversary of the founding of our Organisation  must give States an opportunity to think together  collectively  about what path they should take to develop and strengthen their capacity regularly to review these values.	At a time when the United Nations Decade for International Law is just beginning. States must renew their commitment to the Charter  which organises multilateral co-operation for a common world of peace  development and solidarity  based on the primacy of law and universal respect for human rights."
"26",1203,"CAN",45,1990,"﻿I would like to offer you my congratulations and profound best wishes  Sir  as you assume your important duties as President of the General Assembly at this session. The wisdom and the understanding you bring to this position are particularly appropriate for these historic times. I am confident that you will do great honour to the legacy left by your predecessor.A few days hence the leaders of over 80 countries will gather here to discuss the pressing plight of tens of millions of innocent children around the world - the horrors of hunger and disease  the debilitating consequences of illiteracy  the abomination of abuse. The Prime Minister of Canada has the honour to co-chair that World Summit for Children  which will focus our attention as never before on what this Organisation must still do: construct a world order that allows all nations  all peoples  all colours and creeds to live on a planet that is prosperous  peaceful  free and just.There is an old Indian saying from Western Canada:""We do not inherit this land from our parents; we simply borrow it from our children.""That idea motivates the Children Summit  as it must this Organisation. We live in uncommon ties. Never before has the opportunity for this body to exercise its intended mission been greater/ and never before have the risks and challenges been so daunting.	.This past year has seen the tearing down of old barriers/ the disintegration of walls - walls of the mind and real walls - walls we once thought permanent.We in the West/ perhaps to an extreme used to view the world through the prism of the cold war. That prism determined many of our priorities and guided our actions. That prism was a prison  and it has now been shattered. The consequence has been liberation. Liberation for millions of people in Central and Eastern Europe who now experience democracy where they only recently dreamt of it. Liberation for the minds of men and women who can now turn to old problems long neglected and new problems now before us. Liberation for the world/ which is now being freed from the tensions of a European balance of terror that penetrated to the farthest corner of the globe. And 1."" aeration for this Organization/ where the words of the United Nations Charter can cease to be distant goals and may now become descriptions of our common action. The past year has seen progress in many regions and on many issues.Namibia  the last colony in Africa  is now its newest democracy. We take great pride of the role that the United Nations played in assisting Namibia to make its transition to independence - a role that was made possible by the international force involving 109 Member of the Organisation.In South Africa Nelson Mandela is now free  and he and President de Klerk are on the verge of beginning a process of negotiation with a view to building a non-racial  democratic South Africa. We applaud this process and impatiently wait the day when we shall see clear and irreversible changes in the apartheid regime. We call upon all South Africans to show the necessary good will to bring  to end to the violence which is casting a shadow over the negotiation process.In Cambodia the parties to that long  bloody conflict may be on the path to a peaceful settlement.   All Cambodians welcome the unanimity displayed by the Security Council when it approved last week a framework for a comprehensive political solution to this conflict. Ш hope that this will soon set Cambodia on the road to a just  peaceful and lasting settlement. Canada unequivocally supports that effort and we have already pledged $1.5 million to help the United Nations give effect to its plans.Elsewhere in Asia the Government of South Korea has in our view taken a welcome initiative in beginning talks with its northern neighbour. We hope that Korea will become a full and active Member of the Organisation.In Latin America the unique experience and expertise of the United Nations in peace-keeping has been invaluable. The cease-fire in Nicaragua  the successful conclusion of the democratic process there  and progress in the talks in El Salvador and Guatemala may finally bring hope to a region torn too long by conflict and ideology. In the Persian Gulf the United Nations is playing the role it has not been able to play for decades. Thanks to the Organisation  the international community has been able to bring its authority to bear on a country which has grossly and clearly contravened the United Nations Charter's prohibition on policies of aggression and has thereby endangered the serious efforts of all the Members of the United Nations to settle disputes peacefully.The Security Council's ability to act in concert is without any doubt testimony to the new era of co-operation now opening to us. But it is also a warning to Iraq that the United Nations will not relent until Iraq has withdrawn its forces from Kuwait and restored independence to that small country.We obviously need more than resolutions. All the Members of the United Nations - each in its own way - should ensure the effectiveness of the measures adopted so far and should use whatever diplomatic resources are available to them to persuade Iraq to withdraw its troops. Iraq's aggression is a litmus test for what the United Nations can now become. It we succeed here the United Nations will send a clear and unambiguous signal to others that the world is now different  that it will not tolerate aggression and that international law is to be served and not ignored.Now is not a time for complacency. That we are succeeding in some parts of the world means we have yet to succeed in others. That we have solved some problems means there are many still to solve.In Lebanon a grave situation continues  and  while we take heart from constitutional progress made in the past year  all members of the international community  collectively and individually - must make efforts to restore Lebanon's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the Middle East  although the world is focused on the Gulf  the continuing Arab-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli disputes are unresolved and threatening. A just and lasting negotiated solution based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to self-determination  is more vital now than ever before.In the Western Sahara some progress has been made through the great efforts of the Secretary-General to encourage dialogue directed to peace. The real difficulties persist and a settlement has yet to be reached»And in the Horn of Africa the cycle of conflict  poverty and starvation continues. While we can take pride in the way the United Nations and its agencies provided food to those in need  only a lasting political solution will end the terrible curse of famine in that region.Around the world the challenge is all too clear: unequal levels of development which perpetuate poverty and spawn conflict; a world population which will expand by 3.5 billion people over the next three and a half decades; 14 million children dying each year from illness and hunger; a generation debilitated by drugs; the proliferation of weapons - chemical  nuclear and conventional; and an ailing environment  whose air is being poisoned  whose oceans and lakes are becoming cesspools  and whose forests are being destroyed as if they were disposable. This is not the picture of a planet of promise: it is the picture of a planet in pain.My own country  Canada  is a place blessed by Providence. We are prosperous. We are free. We are at peace. But we too have had to confront the need for new attitudes and new approaches to our own problems  including the situation of our aboriginal people. Although we failed this year in finding a new constitutional accommodation for our country  I can promise the Assembly that Canada will succeed in renewing our Confederation. We shall do so with that same flexibility  imagination  tolerance and compromise which have made Canada; a nation of so many cultures  into what Barbara Nard once called ""the first international country"".I have raised those values because they are precisely the ones that speak of the needs of this Organisation and this world. In this new era compromise must cease to be seen as second best; it must become the instrument of our common cause.In the years between the two world wars and in the depths of the cold war  there were debates about whether a State's interests were best pursued through unilateral action or through co-operation and compromise. That debate is now over. It is over not because one side won but because the world has changed. The choice today is not between realism and idealism  unilateralism or co-operation; it is between success and failure. Co-operation is now the new realism and pragmatism is the only path to progress. We either work together and succeed  or we work separately and fail. We need new action. But we also need new attitudes - ideas that animate  ideas that indicate what is no longer feasible and what is now necessary.I believe our first challenge is to redefine the concept of security. Security has ceased to be something to be achieved unilaterally. Security has ceased to be something to be attained through military means alone. Security has become multidimensional and it has become co-operative. In a world where poverty and underdevelopment plague most of the planet  the developed world cannot pretend to be secure simply because it alone is prosperous. In an era of nuclear and chemical weapons  of ballistic missiles  of terrorism  of interdependent markets and economies  of diseases  the development of prosperity throughout the world; is not a question o£ charity but a question of security. That mandates continued emphasis on official development assistance  on more open and free markets  on innovative debt strategies. These are not only economic or humanitarian actions; they have become security imperatives.In a world where the frontiers of States may be secure but the air  land and water are being poisoned  environmental action is also a fundamental security question. And in a period of burgeoning population and rapid industrialisation  where winds and waters know no borders  environmental security will be only achieved through co-operation. That mandates an approach to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development that is aggressive and innovative. It requires a realistic dialogue between the developing and the developed world about environmental damage that threatens all States  rich and poor. As part of that effort» Canada will vigorously pursue the possibility of a world forestry convention by 1992.A now concept of security also requires that we address »ore effectively the political and Military tensions that persist in so many regions of the world. While there is such to be done globally  I believe that a new focus on regional approaches to security is more necessary and more promising than ever. It is more necessary both because of the consequences of conflict arising from interdependence and because of the destructive nature of modern weapons. And it is more promising because the absence of East-West tensions now frees countries and regions to pursue solutions to local problems on local terms.Security is more than the absence of war; it is the presence of peace. That requires a shared sense on each side that the survival of the other is in its own best interest. That means building trust and confidence. Canada believes that a regional approach to confidence building has much to offer. That approach can involve a variety of measures dialogue itself designed to exchange perspectives and increase understanding; greater transparency in terms of military capacity; agreements to inform other members in the region of activities they night consider threatening in the absence of warning; and eventually institutions and processes of conflict resolution and crisis prevention.Confidence building is not a blueprint or a grand solution. It does not prejudge outcomes or impose solutions. It is not rigid. It is in fact what the Organisation has always done best. It is step-by-step. It is functional. It is flexible. The success of such an approach in Europe is undeniable. Obviously  specific measures taken in Europe nay not apply to other regions. Those regions will require approaches tailored to their nature and requirements. But the fundamental principles of confidence building apply.It is for that reason that  in addition to proposing new initiatives for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  Canada has suggested that the countries of the North-Pacific region could benefit from similar approaches to confidence building. Those might include advance notification of military manoeuvres  an Open Skies regime  and military data exchanges. Other regions of the world - the Middle East  Latin America - might also benefit from a regional approach to confidence building.One of the key elements of confidence building is verification. Verification provides proof  and proof triggers trust. That is why Canada co-sponsored the resolution adopted by the General Assembly calling for an experts' study on verification to be conducted by the Secretary-General - resolution 43/81 B. A Canadian chaired that study and we will take the lead at this session of the Assembly in proposing a resolution that will call on the United Nations to promote increased dialogue between diplomats and experts on verification issues; to establish a United Nations data bank of verification research material; and to support and expand where appropriate the powers of the Secretary-General to engage in fact-finding missions as they relate to the possible violation of existing arms-control agreements.There is one persistent security problem above all others that the international community has failed to address satisfactorily. That is the problem of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and proliferation of their means of delivery  as well as conventional weapons  which have become so destructive. We all recognize that arms do not cause conflicts. But we must also recognise that arms can make conflict more likely and that they make that conflict more destructive when it occurs. The progress between the super-Powers on the reduction of their stockpiles of nuclear weapons is welcome  as is the progress made to date in ensuring a successful conclusion to the conventional-force-reduction talks currently under way in Vienna. Those negotiations can- and must succeed. But to reduce capabilities and enhance confidence in one region and with some weapons is only part of the challenge. There is much more to be done.In the area of nuclear proliferation  the just-concluded Review Conference of the Non-proliferation Treaty  despite consensus on almost all issues  was unable to agree on a concluding document  that failure should alert us all to the dangerous prospect of the unravelling of that vital international Treaty. Canada believes that movement is needed on all sides. We welcome the joint American and Soviet commitment to a step-by-step approach to further restrictions on nuclear testing. We believe that commitment should be followed up immediately  with the final goal being a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing.At the same time  we have been deeply disturbed by a tendency among some others to adopt positions that can only act to undermine the vital consensus which underlies the existing treaties on non-proliferation and nuclear testing. Clearly  compromise and forward movement are required on the part of everyone. But the pursuit of other objectives should not be allowed to threaten those existing agreements that have become so vital. It is Canada's firm view that both the non-proliferation Treaty and a comprehensive test-ban treaty are too important for international peace and security to be held hostage one to the other.Regional nuclear arms and the threat of chemical proliferation and use have been raised starkly again by the situation in the Persian Gulf. We must move quickly to a comprehensive and global ban on chemical weapons. We urge all parties at the Conference on Disarmament to ensure that the opportunity for a successful agreement is not lost and that agreement is reached soon. During this session of the Assembly  Canada  along with Poland  will seek to strengthen the commitment of all members to that end.In addition  there is the very important issue of arms transfers and the arms trade. It is critical that peace in Europe not he purchased at the price of a more innovative arras bazaar elsewhere. That arras bazaar has stunted development by hijacking scarce resources. It has distorted whole economies. It has increased bloodshed. It is important in that context that all parties to the conventional-force-reduction talks in Europe take steps to ensure that weapons affected by that agreement not end up as contributions to potential conflicts elsewhere in the world.The continued proliferation of ballistic-missile technology is particularly worrisome. Ballistic missiles raise the prospect of the delivery of weapons of mass destruction into the heart of enemy territory. That possibility not only means great potential suffering; it also induces regional arms races. That is why Canada has so strongly supported the recent expansion of the membership of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The Assembly should focus on that issue and call for all Members to take measures to control the export of that technology. Canada will play a leading role in such an effort.Canada also believes that is important to make arms transfers and procurement as transparent as is prudent and practical. Transparency builds confidence and is recognition of the obligation we all have to the common interest. That is why Canada has strongly supported the work of the United Nations Group of Government Experts on Arms Transfer Transparency and why we look forward to studying its report in detail. That is why we support the widest possible voluntary reporting to the United Nations of military expenditures  procurement and arms transfers. I am pleased to announce that  this year for the first time  Canada will be releasing an annual report on its exports of military goods.There is  with arms  a demand side and a supply side. Measures can be taken to restrict supplies to stabilising and prudent levels. But demand must also be addressed  and that is why a regional approach to confidence building is relevant to the issue too.Finally  Canada believes that much more can be done to ensure that the United Nations unique capacity to provide peace-keeping forces for regional conflicts remains effective and efficient. Ï am pleased that Canada was able to help breathe new life into the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations  which has now provided the United Nations with new proposals to improve present peace-keeping activities and to plan for new ventures. However  more work and even greater commitment will be needed to ensure that the United Nations is provided with the capacity and the resources to mount varied  speedy and successful peace-keeping operations  be they in Cambodia  Central America  the Western Sahara or the Persian Gulf.In particular  Canada would support a United Nations effort to secure a clear indication from all Member States of the forces and equipment they could make available in future United Nations peace-keeping operations. We believe that effort could include an inventory of civilian resources. That might include police forces  communications and logistics personnel and elections experts and observers  who could be utilized not only to keep the peace but to prepare for peace. If there is one thing that recent events make clear  it is that democracy and freedom are fundamental factors in building a co-operative security structure for our new era. In Central and Eastern Europe  Latin America  Asia and parts of Africa  there is a new recognition that democracy is necessary because democracy works. That is not the victory of one ideology over another. It is the victory of common sense. Democracy allows Governments to gauge and reflect the needs of their societies. Democracy allows individuals to express their views and exercise their abilities. Democracy and development go hand in hand  since it is the open market which feeds prosperity and leads  almost always  to democracy.Democracy limits the conflict which inevitably results from repression. Democracy is flexible  and because it is flexible it does not snap. Democracy  at bottom  is the politics of pragmatism and the politics of security.It is our belief in the role of democracy in building security that has led Canada to propose a democratic development unit for the Organization of American States. That proposal has been accepted. It is that same belief that has led Canada to put forward human rights proposals in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which will strengthen the rule of law and the rights of minorities throughout Europe  It is the same belief that has led Canada to contribute  bilaterally and through the Commonwealth  to democratic dialogue and preparations for constitutional talks in South Africa.That is also why Canada applauds the July decision of the Organisation of African Unity to endorse a new charter dealing with democracy and development and why we supported financially the conference which produced it. And that is why we provided election assistance this year to Haiti  Bulgaria  Czechoslovakia  Namibia and Nicaragua.Canada believes that there is a further role for this Organisation in encouraging democratic development. Through supporting the co-operation of the various regional organizations in exchanging information and improving co-ordination  and through encouraging Member States in their many recent efforts to strengthen democracy  the General Assembly can act as a catalyst in reinforcing both democracy and security. As we move forward  I believe there are several guidelines we can usefully adopt as we seek together to build a structure of co-operative security.Guideline 1 is that co-operative security is multidimensional. It is based on the recognition that there are many significant threats to our livelihood  our health  our development and our very existence.Guideline 2 is that co-operative security accepts that links exist between threats. It recognizes that few threats can be managed satisfactorily without also addressing others  that peace requires prosperity  that stability requires justice within and between States  that democracy  development and disarmament are all related.Guideline 3 is that co-operative security is functional. It seeks to avoid blueprints and grand schemes and focuses on institutions and approaches which work  which produce results.Guideline 4 is that co-operative security requires dialogue and compromise. It accepts the fundamental truth that conversation is almost always better than conflict and that conversation leading to compromise is the best way to solve problems.Guideline 5 is that co-operative security builds on the link between stability and change. It demands that we accept that order and predictability are not an alternative to change  but rather its foundation  and that order in turn requires growth and flexibility if it is to endure.Guideline 6 is that co-operative security rejects blocs. Blocs perpetuate distrust. They build a tension between regions and groups which is no better than tension between States. They perpetuate a ""them versus us"" psychology which may satisfy sentiment but which does little to solve problems. Guideline 7 is that co-operative security rejects stale rhetoric and sterile ideology. It sees no advantage in stereotypes and sees much damage in the prejudice perpetuated by them. It rejects - as Canada  for example  does - such blemishes on this Organisation as the odious resolution equating Zionism with racism adopted 15 years ago by the Assembly.Guideline 8 is that co-operative security recognizes that true security is impossible without justice. It accepts that democracy within States is a force for stability and prosperity and that justice between States/ whether through development assistance/ debt relief or fairer and more open terms of trade  is a necessary component of a secure world.Today in Ottawa on our Parliament Hill a statue was unveiled to Lester B. Pearson; a great Canadian leader and world statesman  a true friend of this Organization. Mr. Pearson was present at the creation of the United Nations. We helped build its Charter. We helped mould its mission. We played a central role in establishing the Organization's great tradition of peace-keeping. There was no cause to which he was more committed than the construction of an effective United Nations system. Out of the ashes of the Second World War and the First World War before it he sought to build a structure of co-operative security which would prevent Armageddon and build a world which was prosperous/ free and just for all. Lester Pearson never saw the United Nations fulfil its intended purpose. His dream was dashed by yet another war  the cold war.That war is now over. The promise is renewed/ and the dream rekindled. Yet the challenges remain more acute/ more demanding than ever before. Let us do now what we have been unable to do before. Let us shake off our past failings/ confront our present and in so doing build a new future. Let us behave as United Nations. "
"27",1264,"CHL",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  I come before this Assembly with joy and great emotion  as the authentic voice of the Chilean nation  which has only recently been reborn to democratic life. With deep satisfaction I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to conduct the proceedings of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I should also like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Garba of Nigeria on his positive and dynamic performance during his recently ended term as President. I also extend my greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. We  in Chile  are proud of the prestige which this great Peruvian diplomat has brought to the United Nations. His visit to our country just a few days ago was an honour for us.As members are aware  Chile has distinguished itself throughout its history for its freedom-loving spirit  its respect for law and the soundness of its democratic system. We have recovered those values and we have done so in peace  without rancour  looking to the future and with a broad sense of hope and reconciliation.The logic of war that divided Chileans into friends and enemies has been overcome by the logic of peace where we all recognize each other as compatriots  no matter what our differences may be. The average Chilean is enjoying a fuller life in  liberty and greater security without the fears of the past  in happiness and with hope because he is aware that he is respected  and his dignity is valued. We also know that he has been called on to participate with his contribution to the common cause of building the future of our homeland·In renewing these traditions of a democratic people  Chile  through me  expresses its greetings and gratitude to the United Nations and to all the peoples and individuals the world over who stood by Chilean democrats in their struggle to defend the dignity of man and win back their freedom.The issue of human rights occupies a special place in the relationship between Chile and the United Nations. We have been tireless promoters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since its inception. We have fostered a concept of human rights that goes beyond the physical protection of the person to encompass political  social  economic and cultural dimensions  and we have advocated the supremacy of these principles. For Chilean democracy  human rights have never known any frontiers.In the recent past  however  the pendulum swung in the other direction. When serious violations of human rights occurred in my country  the United Nations never once relaxed its scrutiny of events in Chile. This position of vigilance  expressed in repeated condemnations of the situation obtaining at that time  constituted a valuable contribution to the restoration of democracy  for which I should like publicly to express my gratitude today.This experience has strengthened our commitment. We know full well that unqualified respect for human rights is a universal imperative that constitutes the moral and juridical foundations of all civilized life in both the national and international spheres. We likewise believe that the defence of human rights is an ongoing and universal endeavour  which must never be used for discriminatory purposes or in the service of other foreign policy objectives. Human rights must be protected everywhere and at all times.We therefore deem it important to inform the international community about the spirit which has moved us to assuage the wounds that were inflicted on the national spirit by the grave human rights violations which occurred in the past.We are tackling this problem with prudence  equity and a great sense of responsibility. There is a need to clarify and ascertain the truth about what happened in the past so as not to keep endlessly alive a constant source of anguish. Nevertheless  we do not wish to hold back the march of history or  even less  to encourage sterile enmities. The aim is to seek the truth and  together with it  genuine reconciliation among Chileans.Towards this end  my Government has ordered the establishment of a special commission known as the ""Commission on Truth and Reconciliation""  whose mandate is to investigate serious violations of human rights. That Commission is gathering the information that is available and will make a report in the relatively near future. Given its administrative character  the Commission is not intended in any way to take the place of the courts of law. The Commission  which is composed of individuals of the highest moral calibre and national prestige  is working in absolute independence and is receiving the co-operation of the various segments of society.In this way  with good will on the part of all  we hope to satisfy the Chilean people's yearnings for peace and understanding through law and on the basis of truth  justice and reconciliation. As it embarks upon a new stage  Chile is facing the challenge of consolidating democracy as a form of political coexistence based on the freedom of the individual  with economic growth and social justice. This  I believe  is a challenge that is common to all developing countries.Experience reveals that it is possible for a time to have economic prosperity without democracy  but such prosperity does not put down lasting roots because the lack of freedom will encourage abuse of the weak  mainly the poor  by the strong  will stifle the initiative and participation of many people  and will create a suffocating climate of oppression and consequent rebellion which will render stability impossible.It is possible to have democracy without economic growth  but well-intentioned efforts to improve the living conditions of those who have less by redistributive measures that bring about greater equality without increasing the supply of goods will inevitably lead to serious economic crises  and these crises will endanger the entire social system and  of course  democracy itself.Without social justice  any democracy  no matter how prosperous it may be  will live under the permanent threat that the understandable agitation of the poor for equity will disrupt the economic development process and jeopardize the stability of the political system itself.In order to achieve peace and stability in national life it is therefore essential simultaneously to ensure democracy in the political sphere  growth in the economic sphere and justice in the social sphere. This is precisely the task undertaken by the Chilean people.If we are to be successful in that undertaking we need to pool our domestic efforts and ensure that they are orderly  and we must also have the understanding and co-operation of our friends around the world  especially the major developed countries. Our best efforts may be reduced to naught if equity and solidarity do not prevail in economic relations between our countries.This is a problem that vitally affects the entire developing world. If we wish to remain faithful to the principles that presided over the founding of the Organization we must be consistent in pursuing the idea that world peace is closely linked to the reign of freedom  economic and social progress and rising standards of living for all the world's peoples. As long as there are peoples ground down by hunger or poverty  or others who  although their plight is less dire  must grapple with insuperable obstacles in their efforts to achieve growth and advancement  the cause of peace will continue to be threatened.The activities of the various specialized agencies of the United Nations  of the international financial system and of programmes of co-operation between industrialized countries and developing nations are without a doubt very important contributions towards the solution of this problem. However  I would venture to make an appeal to the most highly aware and responsible leaders in the major developed countries to weigh fully the impact their own decisions may have on the enhancement or the decline of freedom  justice  progress and peace in our world.We cherish the hope that the new climate of peace between the great Powers will enable the richest nations to shift the resources they have been spending on defence towards the objectives of economic and social progress in the developing world.We reaffirm the basic tenets that have guided Chile's foreign policy and that largely reflect the national consensus. Those tenets are fully in keeping with the values  principles and objectives that constitute the raison d'être of the United Nations.Within that framework the main objectives of Chile's foreign policy are as follows: first  to restore our country's influence in the world by means of realistic action inspired by the values and principles to which we have already referred  with special emphasis on the defence of human rights; secondly  to make our international relations more universal in the political  economic  social and cultural fields; thirdly  to promote economic integration and political co-ordination in Latin America  including the development of modern concepts of security which strengthen peace and democracy in the region; fourthly  to pursue an open and modern external economic policy linking Chile to the dynamic centres of growth and technological innovation; fifthly  to foster relations of co-operation and understanding with the developing countries; and  lastly  to strengthen multilateral organizations and Chile's participation in their activities.The world is rapidly undergoing a transition to a new international reality. We welcome the strengthening of freedom  the greater respect for human rights and the expansion of democracy  all of which augur well for the progress of mankind.Now more than ever there is a need to intensify the struggle against authoritarian systems of every stripe. Today  the ideological excuses for dictatorships are crumbling. There is no possible legitimacy for rule by force. Full enjoyment of the fundamental freedoms of the human person is the necessary condition for any civilized society. My Government therefore strongly supports and attaches great importance to the consideration of appropriate ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of the principle of periodic and genuine elections  which is under way in the Commission on Human Rights.We view as extraordinarily positive the end of the cold war  the guest for agreement and the climate of friendship and co-operation between the great Powers. We extend a most cordial welcome to the united Germany and to the new European democracies. That spirit needs to spread to the other nations and make it possible to end the numerous conflicts and tensions that have dragged on for years in different parts of the world.This new situation has strengthened the political and moral unity of the United Nations and must give an impetus to political dialogue aimed at improving the international situation. The time has come decisively to quicken the pace of efforts aimed at achieving general and complete disarmament  a ban on the use of nuclear weapons  the cessation of nuclear testing and a total renunciation of the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons.It would be counter to that spirit and an unacceptable threat were the dread and now defunct cold war to be replaced by an intensification of regional  ethnic or religious conflicts. The United Nations must remain alert to this situation and must take action under the Charter whenever it deems it necessary.The unanimous international condemnation of the invasion of Kuwait is an expression of those desires and principles and a reflection of the repudiation and just indignation aroused by such conduct  which is a flagrant violation of the norms of international law and a grave threat to the dawning era of peace and co-operation. Chile fully supports and is scrupulously complying with the decisions that the Security Council has taken on this matter. My Government reaffirms its conviction that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) constitute an adequate basis for guaranteeing both Israel's right to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries and the Palestinian people's right to a sovereign State.There are other areas of tensions in the world that also give cause for concern. We are confident that solutions will be found to those problems by peaceful means  in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Chile also condemns all forms of racism and racial discrimination and  in particular  the harmful apartheid regime. My country fervently hopes that the new avenues that are being explored with imagination and political will by the Government of President De Klerk and the African National Congress  through its leader. Nelson Mandela  will lead to the final demise of apartheid through peaceful negotiations that will lead to democracy without discrimination and based on respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Forty-five years have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations  and today it is gratifying to be able to give the Organization high marks for its very important work in the field of decolonization. The full implementation of the Declaration on decolonization must eliminate colonialism before the beginning of the next millennium. In this new world environment each region must promote collective security in order to reduce mistrust and strengthen peace within the framework of the international treaties and agreements in force.We wish to highlight the extraordinary contributions various Governments have made  with the support of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations  with the aim of bringing greater tranquillity to Central America.Chile is privileged to be geographically situated in a region where wisdom and common sense have prevailed  as evidenced by the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Argentina in 1984 and the strengthening of co-operation between our two countries.Chile's traditional vocation has been one of participation and co-operation in Latin America. We believe it is essential to promote regional and subregional political linkages. The establishment of large-scale economic zones in other parts of the world forces us to reflect  among ourselves and together with other groupings  on the best way of dealing with these new phenomena and avoiding the risks implicit in the protectionism they represent.The region is experiencing an important period in which its economic structures are being opened up and modernized. This entails adjustments and varying paces of domestic change which must be taken into account in agreeing upon pragmatic forms of co-operation. Our aim is to advance towards stable and lasting trade and investment agreements which will make it possible to overcome the traditional obstacles to our reciprocal trade. We have already taken important steps in this direction with various countries and shall continue to advance down that path.No nation can remain unaffected by world-wide trends towards more open markets and the establishment of large-scale economic zones. What is needed  therefore  is a review of the prevailing policies and existing structures in the developing regions and an effective policy for gaining access to markets in the industrialized countries.The developing nations will not be able to introduce greater openness into their economies and expand their exports unless they receive reciprocal treatment from the most advanced countries. We have noted recently with disappointment that both tariff and non-tariff barriers not only subsist but are increasing; such barriers hamper or even prevent the export of our goods to markets in the industrialized countries. In our view  external co-operation is absolutely essential in order to facilitate world-trade flows and introduce greater flexibility with respect to debt-servicing obligations.In the light of what I have said so far  my Government will consider in a positive spirit the so-called Americas Initiative announced recently by the President of the United States  who has proposed the establishment of a free-trade zone in the Western Hemisphere. In our view  this is a constructive step towards an improved continental relationship.If detente proves to be effective and lasting  we can envisage a United Nations which  instead of having to focus the bulk of its efforts on avoiding the armed confrontations that result from a divided world  can devote itself to solving problems common to us all  such as the struggle against drug addiction; problems of the family  women  young people  the elderly and the handicapped; environmental degradation; food shortages; terrorism; the development of health and sanitation  and a whole range of other problems dealt with by the Organization. The solutions we find will help bring about better conditions for mankind.In November this year Chile will have the honour of acting as host to the most important meeting ever held within the Antarctic Treaty System for the protection of the environment of the frozen continent. Chile  like all the parties to the Treaty  is profoundly committed to this objective. Our planet is undergoing profound changes  and today more than ever before there is a need for imaginative and creative vision in dealing with the current international realities. Practical ideas must be sought without neglecting moral values or beliefs. We must maintain our passion for fighting against injustices  but a calm attitude and a realistic approach are essential to the guest for the most effective ways of solving these problems. With this realistic approach we must recognize that the economic resources available to the United Nations are meagre  and this situation is compounded by the great diversity of the issues with which the United Nations has to deal.We are therefore in favour of streamlining the United Nations system to the fullest extent possible by avoiding duplication and achieving greater co-ordination between specialized agencies and greater financial and administrative efficiency. That will make more feasible a speedier response to the problems we are facing. We strongly support the efforts being made now to this end.On the whole  it is clear that the advance of democracy has made for greater humanization in the political sphere. There is greater respect for the individual  and the individual is more protected and less vulnerable. However  at the same time  there is a counter-trend towards increased dehumanization in the social sphere. Equality of opportunity is declining  the individual is increasingly defenceless against his environment; employment is difficult to find and hold on to; and people are unable to make ends meet with their earnings  while large segments of the population live in conditions of extreme poverty.The world social situation is  in our view  the most serious problem that must be solved  since it poses a threat to international stability.There is an urgent need for international social justice; in order to prevent the economic difficulties of the least developed countries from being transposed to the political sphere and affecting the processes of economic modernization and political democratization.We must therefore deal with social issues from an interconnected global perspective  giving health  education  housing  employment  the status of women  youth development and other related matters the urgent priority they require. We join in the many appeals for such an approach which have been made from this rostrum.The accurate diagnosis and comprehensive analysis with which various studies and reports of the Organization have provided us are marred  however  by the lack of specific proposals for combating the evils which have been weakening our societies. We therefore consider it of the utmost importance to give the Secretary-General the mandate he needs so that  in the shortest possible time and drawing upon the vast store of information that already exists  he can propose specific action-oriented measures for alleviating the most serious social problems that have been identified.It is especially encouraging that in the next few days the Heads of State and Government of nearly 70 countries will be meeting to adopt a declaration of political commitment and a plan of action for a better future for the world's children. This is a symbol that the new consciousness for which we have been calling is already emerging  for behind every disadvantaged child is a disadvantaged family. Troubled children symbolize the problems of the world. We must be aware that today's ill-treated child is tomorrow's cynical citizen. In contrast  the child who is secure and protected will without any doubt be a builder of the new and harmonious world we all fervently desire.The international community stands on the threshold of a new era. The fundamental change brought about through the end of the cold war opens up the broadest prospects for increasing and enhancing international co-operation in the twenty-first century. For the first time in its 45 years of existence the United Nations has an opportunity to devote itself to this basic task without having to deal with the limitations imposed by attempts to mediate in the bipolar confrontation  which  since it affected virtually every area  made it enormously difficult to make progress towards constructive understanding.In the context of this new reality  I have a message of peace and optimism to convey on behalf of the people of Chile. Recent events have given mankind reason for hope. Were it not for the grave crisis that has been irresponsibly created in the Persian Gulf that is causing such damage in many different parts of the world and that is responsible for the dangerous uncertainty in which we are living  we might say that the world is advancing towards a higher stage of humanization with all that that entails for the enhancement of peace  freedom and justice.Civilization has advanced as the acceptance and general compliance of the norms that must govern the behaviour of men and the conduct of nations are becoming widespread  thus making possible life in harmony  co-operation and the well-being of mankind.All nations  whether weak or strong  must understand that the United Nations is prepared to ensure that those norms are enforced  that we cannot remain indifferent in the face of any flouting or disregarding of those norms  let alone approve such behaviour. The United Nations exists to support and promote peace  justice  law and the well-being and progress of all. These are the foundations of the national and international commonweal and the underpinning of a civilized order for mankind.Chile believes that all of us - ""we the peoples of the United Nations"" - on the threshold of the twenty-first century face a future that is not without obstacles but that also offers a wealth of promising prospects  whose realization will depend on our determination to work together to abide strictly by the principles of the Charter and to practice the principles of solidarity.In keeping with its means and possibilities  Chile wishes to take part with faith and enthusiasm in this lofty endeavour. This is a new opportunity that has been given to our generation to build a better world. It is a vital challenge to all our peoples and Governments. "
"28",1310,"CHN",45,1990,"﻿I should like to begin by warmly congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am sure that you will fulfil the lofty mission entrusted to you by the Assembly with eminent success. I would also like to express our sincere thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Garba  for his excellent contributions. I also wish to pay a tribute to Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuellar for his outstanding contribution to strengthening the role of the United Nations in current international affairs. Furthermore  I wish to take this opportunity to express our warm welcome to the delegations sent by newly independent Namibia and to Liechtenstein  which is attending the current session of the General Assembly as the 160th Member of the world Organization.The current session is the General Assembly's first in the 1990s. Reviewing the 1980s  we can see that the world has taken an uncommon course. Thanks to the efforts of the peoples of all countries  military confrontation has been reduced and the factors for peace have increased. Profound changes are taking place in the world today. German unification will soon become a reality. Co-operation between various regions of the world is increasing. The trend towards multipolarization has grown noticeably. However  power politics continue. Political  economic and ethnic strains have become increasingly evident  and tensions and complicated situations have emerged in some regions.World attention is held by the situation in the Persian Gulf  which has drastically deteriorated in recent weeks. China is opposed to Iraq's armed invasion and annexation of Kuwait  an action that  in China's view  constitutes a violation of the United Nations Charter and a gross trampling on the accepted norms governing international relations  and is thus entirely impermissible. It is in keeping with its principled position that disputes between States should be resolved through friendly consultation without resorting to force that China has voted in support of the nine Security Council resolutions concerning the Gulf crisis  with a view to maintaining those basic norms and restoring peace and security in the Gulf region.The Chinese Government has adopted a serious and earnest attitude towards the aforementioned Security Council resolutions. Despite its heavy losses resulting from enforcing sanctions  China has strictly implemented those resolutions. That gives full expression to the sense of principle inherent in China's foreign policy and to its dedication to upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and fulfilling its obligations as a permanent member of the Security Council.The Chinese Government supports a political settlement of the Gulf crisis within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We call on Iraq to respond to the mediation efforts of the Arab countries and the United Nations Secretary-General by immediately withdrawing its forces from Kuwait  so that the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country can be restored. We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint and avoid resorting to force. We appeal to the international community to make joint efforts on the basis of Security Council resolutions to ease the tension there  and we urge the parties concerned to resolve the dispute through peaceful negotiations.The Gulf crisis has occurred at a juncture where the old world pattern is being replaced by a new one. That causes people to ponder the direction in which the world is headed and the kind of political order that is necessary in order to preserve peace. Post-war history shows that the bullying of the weak and small by the strong and powerful  and the trampling on others' sovereignty can only cause conflicts and endanger regional and world peace. Normal international relations can be ensured only when all countries observe the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful co-existence. Those five principles embody the most fundamental norms of international relations and are in full accord with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. They have stood the test of international vicissitudes and enjoy wide support in the international community.The establishment of a new international political order on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence meets the needs of the times and is urgently desired by the peoples of all countries. Such a new political order should  in China's view  include the following points: first  every country is entitled to choose its own political economic and social systems in accordance with its own national conditions. Secondly  all countries  and especially the big Powers  must strictly abide by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Thirdly  all countries should respect one another  seek common ground while putting aside their differences  live together in amity  treat each other as equals  and carry on mutually beneficial co-operation.Fourthly  international disputes should be settled on a fair basis through peaceful means without resort to the threat or use of force. Lastly  all countries  big or small  strong or weak  are entitled to take part in the discussion and management of world affairs on an equal footing.Regional issues are closely related to world peace. The Middle East remains the most turbulent and unstable region  posing a direct threat to world peace. The Chinese Government supports a political settlement of the Middle East question  which should provide for Israel's withdrawal from all Arab territories under its occupation  mutual recognition between the State of Palestine and the State of Israel  and peaceful coexistence between the Arab and Jewish peoples.We support the convening of the International Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the five permanent members of the Security Council. We appreciate the positive efforts made by the Arab League to achieve a solution to the question of Lebanon and support any settlement plan that helps safeguard the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. We hope that the parties to the Middle East question will pursue their dialogue and strive to advance the Middle East peace process.The relaxation and stabilization of the situation in the Korean peninsula are the common desire of the people of the region. China supports the unremitting efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. Recently  the north and south of Korea held the first meeting between their premiers since their division 45 years ago. That is an important event in the process of improving relations between the north and south of Korea. We hope that the north and south of Korea will take that meeting as a starting-point and  through dialogue  further remove antagonism and misunderstanding with a view to ultimately achieving the peaceful unification of the country.The Cambodian question has lasted for over a decade now. It has not only brought dire suffering to the Cambodian people  but has also gravely jeopardized the peace and stability of the South-East Asia region. The time is now ripe for a settlement. The five documents worked out by the five permanent members of the Security Council constitute the framework of a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian question. Major progress was made in the meeting of the Cambodian parties held in Jakarta not long ago. It is important to urge the Cambodian parties to elect Prince Sihanouk as President of the Supreme National Council so as to ensure its normal functioning. We maintain that the Paris International Conference should be reconvened as early as possible so that the documents of the five permanent members will be elaborated for adoption  with a view to achieving eventually a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian question. It is our sincere hope that the various Cambodian parties will achieve a genuine national reconciliation and work together to bring about internal peace  stability and development of their country.Over the past year  further progress has been made in the field of disarmament. The United States and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement in principle on partial reduction of their strategic nuclear weapons and agreed to cut down their respective chemical weapons. Fruitful results can be expected of the negotiations for the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. The United Nations Disarmament Commission has reached consensus on some agenda items which dragged on for years. The negotiations for a treaty on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons are also going on in depth. Progress in all these respects are well received in the international community.However  it must be noted that the task of disarmament is still arduous. We hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will continue to make efforts to drastically reduce their respective nuclear and conventional armaments  stop their qualitative arms race and completely destroy their chemical weapon stockpiles. The Chinese Government holds that in order to prevent a nuclear war and promote nuclear disarmament  all nuclear States should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances and unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States and nuclear-free zones.The world economy is being internationalized. The economies of the North and the South are closely related and inseparable. If the economies of the poorer countries  whose population makes up four fifths of the world's total  cannot be developed  and if the North-South relations cannot be radically improved  this situation will not serve the interests of the richer countries either and will make it difficult to ensure world peace and stability.Since the 1980s  many developing countries have suffered serious economic difficulties  facing such burning issues as huge debt burden  worsened terms of trade and reversed flow of capital. For hundreds of millions of people  the problem of adequate food and clothing is far from being solved. The soaring oil prices caused by the current Gulf crisis have generated enormous negative impact on the world economy  giving rise to wide anxiety. The developing countries of the third world  whose economies were already in great difficulty  have found themselves in deeper water as they are forced to bear the brunt. The world is faced all the more urgently with the question of establishing the new international economic order. We insist that it is essential to change the unfair and inequitable international economic order. In the handling of international economic relations  it is essential to  abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The developed countries are obliged to do their part in improving the international economic environment  and particularly in resolving the issue of foreign debt of the developing countries. People of all countries have the right to determine their own economic mode and their own path of economic development and make necessary readjustments in their economic policies when the need arises.Many countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America are strengthening their unity and co-operation  and more and more regional organizations are exploring ways for common progress. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC)  the South Pacific Forum (SPF)  the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC)  the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  the Latin American Economic System (SELA)  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  the Group of Rio and the trans-regional organizations such as the Group of 77  the Group of 15 and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have played an increasingly important role in enhancing South-South co-operation and promoting North-South dialogue. We appreciate and support all this. We also support the efforts made by the Non-Aligned Movement for the economic development of the third world.Environment is yet another salient issue facing the world today. The people of all countries are increasingly aware that improving the environment and protecting the Earth is a long-term interest of mankind and a basic condition for the survival of the human race. For historical and present-day reasons  the developing countries lack the capability to protect and improve the environment. We believe that  without the participation of the developing countries  there can be no fundamental improvement of the environment. So we appeal to the developed countries possessing financial resources and advanced science and technology to play a greater role in bettering the global environment. Besides doing a good job of improving the environment in their own countries  they are duty-bound to help the developing countries increase their capabilities for environmental protection in the course of their economic development. China attaches great importance to the problem of environment  and has made environmental protection a basic state policy and taken an active part in international co-operation in this field. We appeal to all countries and all regions to get well prepared for the Conference on Environment and Development scheduled for 1992.In recent years  drug addiction and trafficking has spread world-wide and become a hazard to humanity. With a 150-year history of anti-drug struggle  the Chinese people are keenly aware of the evil of narcotics. After its founding  New China carried on an effective fight to eliminate the evil of opium  thus winning the good name of a drug-free country. In the past few years  some international drug rings have conducted transit drug trafficking in some border provinces and cities of China  and along with it drug abuse has occurred in the border regions. The Chinese Government has taken resolute measures and achieved marked results in cracking down on drug addiction and trafficking. The Chinese Government consistently holds that drug prohibition is a responsibility that should be shared by the producing  consuming and transit countries. Only by the concerted efforts and more effective actions on the part of the entire international community can there be a final victory over the scourge of narcotic drugs. We appreciate the efforts made by the relevant United Nations bodies and other countries to fight against drug abuse and trafficking. We are ready to continue and strengthen our co-operation with other countries and the relevant United Nations bodies in this field.The Chinese people  full of confidence  are advancing along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the past decade  we succeeded in doubling the country's gross national product of the year of 1980. We have the confidence and capability to double it again in the 1990s. The decade of reform and opening to the outside world has brought enormous real benefits to the Chinese people. The policy of reform and opening up  which enjoys the strong support of our people  will not and cannot be changed. The past year has witnessed political stability and social tranquillity in China as well as steady improvement of its economy. Stability and development in China not only benefit the Chinese people  but also contribute to peace in Asia and the world as a whole. China needs stability and the world needs a stable China. China is ready  together with other countries  to do its part for the cause of human progress.We are pleased to note that in the past year  the United Nations has continued to play an active part in maintaining world peace and security and in resolving a number of urgent problems facing mankind. In advancing the peace process and political settlement of regional conflicts the United Nations has made unremitting efforts and scored commendable achievements. In the critical and complex situation in which the world finds itself  the United Nations has before it an even greater responsibility and more challenging tasks  and should play a more important role  so that it will not let down the high expectations of the people of the world. We have consistently maintained that the internal affairs of a country can only be decided independently by the people of that country and that international affairs can only be decided by the countries of the world  big and small  strong and weak  through consultations on an equal footing. History has proved that the super-Powers cannot dominate the world. History will prove again that a small number of big and rich Powers cannot monopolize international affairs either.Looking forward into the 1990s  we see a world which is faced with challenges and risks but is also full of opportunities and hopes. No matter how the international climate changes  the historical tide of peace and development is irresistible. The future of the world is bright."
"29",1390,"CMR",45,1990,"﻿This forty-fifth session of the General Assembly is being held in a new international setting. The cold war is coming to an end and the arms race is clearly slowing down. Numerous conflicts are approaching a solution. And  despite continued imbalances and profound economic injustice  the initiation of dialogue is once again possible because of the growing interdependence of peoples and nations. All of us must respond to certain major challenges.These facts impart special significance to this session of the Assembly and compel us to derive the fullest possible benefit from it in order to contribute to the advent of a world of justice  peace and liberty. In this connection  I should like to congratulate Mr. Guido de Marco on his outstanding election as President of the Assembly. His great experience and qualities  together with the dynamism and far-sighted policies of his country  the Republic of Malta  within the great family of non-aligned countries and of the United Nations in general  prompt us all to believe that he will discharge most successfully the lofty functions which have been conferred upon him. I can assure him of the constant support of the Cameroonian delegation. Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria  his predecessor  deserves our renewed thanks for the diligence and dynamism with which he conducted not only the work of the forty-fourth session but also the work of subsequent special sessions.We wish to reiterate our support for the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Pores de Cuellar. Cameroon encourages him to continue unrelentingly the efforts he has deployed so admirably throughout the world for the cause of peace and international co-operation  efforts the success of which is emphatically demonstrated by the recent independence of Namibia.Lastly  we wish to congratulate the Principality of Liechtenstein on its admission as the 160th Member of the Organisation  whose universality thus continues to grow.Less than 10 years before the third millennium  the fundamental changes which have occurred in the world since the last session of the Assembly have reshaped the international political chequer-board.Generally speaking the highly symbolic image of the collapse of the Berlin Wall has in a very positive sense reduced the East-West tensions which  since the last war  had so greatly influenced world relations. In such a favourable international climate  dialogue has been restored to favour and is consequently a source of hope in response to the major challenges posed by freedoms  development and science in the closing years of the century.Peace is at our door that is the message sent to us by detente  the opening up of East Europe and the significant improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. That message is strengthened by the progress made in the field of disarmament.In this connection the results of the various Soviet-American summit meetings and agreements have been moat encouraging  as are the various conclusions and recommendations of the work of the Conference on Disarmament and the Fourth Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.We particularly welcome the consensus in the Conference on Disarmament on questions pertaining to South Africa's nuclear capacity  conventional disarmament and the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. We very much trust that the peace dividends resulting from the slackening of the arms race will be devoted to the financing of development  particularly that of the poor countries. The now-acknowledged link between disarmament and development would thus be translated into reality.It is essential that the remarkable improvement in the international political climate bolster our attempts to find solutions to the numerous conflicts which still afflict various parts of the world. Namibia's accession to independence is still fresh in our memories. We wish to take this opportunity yet again to welcome most cordially among us the presence of that young State as a fully fledged Member of the Organisation. The international community  which worked so hard to bring this about  must now provide that country with all the necessary assistance to enable it to consolidate its sovereignty  recover its territorial integrity and promote its economic and social development. Cameroon will certainly spare no effort to develop and strengthen comprehensive co-operation with that brother country.With reference to the situation in South Africa  notwithstanding the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the announcement of a number of reforms and the commencement of a dialogue between the racist regime and the opposition movements  it remains a source of grave concern because the pillars of the odious system of apartheid are still solidly in place  sustaining a disguised form of racist terror which we condemn. In this contest  the international community must keep in place economic sanctions against that regime until it has been shown proof of fundamental  irreversible change in the situation. The objective is not to reform but to eradicate apartheid completely and to set up a free  democratic and non-racial society in South Africa.In Angola and in Mozambique  Cameroon has noted and wishes to encourage the moves made by the leaders of those countries to establish lasting domestic peace. We also support the efforts of the Secretary-General to implement the solutions advocated by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in respect of the conflict in Western Sahara.In the Horn of Africa  as well as between Chad and Libya  or again between Senegal and Mauritania  the needs of peace today require a response from all concerned. Dialogue is the way to salvation.It is with this in mind that the African Heads of State and Government at the last summit meeting of the OAU in Addis Ababa reaffirmed their determination to work together towards a rapid solution of all these conflicts by African efforts and Initiatives.In the Middle East the situation Is still tense. We remain convinced in respect of the Arab-Israeli conflict that any equitable solution must necessarily Involve recognition of the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to have their own homeland  as well as the equally fundamental right of the State of Israel to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized frontiers.Given the complexity of this situation and Its ability to jeopardize world peace  we wish to reiterate our support for the idea of convening  under United Nations auspices  an International conference devoted to this important issue. The cause of peace must also prevail in respect of the critical conflict in the Persian Gulf. The military invasion and occupation of Kuwait and the build-up of troops and various types of armaments to push that region  already quite turbulent  into a particularly explosive situation fraught with incalculable consequences.The international community must pay full attention to this situation. We must act with the greatest restraint and avoid any action capable of exacerbating the situation. The United Nations must act collectively in accordance with the principles of the Charter  focusing particularly on dialogue and broad-based agreement as a way to provide a peaceful settlement of this grave crisis. In any case  the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Kuwait must be restored.In other parts of the world where focal points of tension continue to exist  we must spare no effort to secure the triumph of the principles of international law enshrined in the Charter  particularly non-resort to force in international relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes.In this regard Cameroon welcomes the initiatives now under way in the Korean peninsula to foster a peaceful rapprochement of the two Korean States. Moreover  we hope that the encouraging results achieved in recent negotiations on Cambodia  just endorsed by the Security Council  will be translated into practical achievements.In the same spirit we encourage everything that has been undertaken to restore peace in Central America  the Caribbean and other parts of the world. Lastly  we welcome the praiseworthy efforts which led to the agreements on the reunification of the two Germanys  with which Cameroon has enjoyed excellent relations of friendship and co-operation. My country is fully prepared to continue and intensify its relations with a reunited Germany.Unfortunately  the positive developments on the present international political scene contrast starkly with the world economic situation. This situation  which is markedly unfavourable to the countries of the third world  is characterized by profound structural imbalances: on the one hand  the economies of the countries of the North  which are flourishing  and  on the other  the economies of most of the South  which are in a state of crisis. The shift in world monetary  economic and financial flows and the consequent redistribution of the poles of development are each day gradually marginalising the poor nations.The constant decline in commodity prices  the excessive indebtedness of the developing countries  the diminution of aid  the reversal of net financial flows towards the developed countries  and the inexorable degradation of the environment all remain the essential features of the world economic situation.Africa  more than any other continent  finds itself in very great difficulty. In addition to the ills to which I have just alluded  it has to face natural disasters also  such as drought  desertification  floods  epidemics  famine  invasion by locusts - all of which increase the constraints associated with the adoption of various structural adjustment programmes.The present unprecedented situation of our continent has been exacerbated particularly by the external debt crisis  which absorbs the bulk of our countries' export earnings. That is why we continue to support all initiatives aimed at finding a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the debt problem. We remain convinced that the United Nations  which has already adopted a programme for the economic recovery and development of Africa  can provide a decisive impetus to this undertaking.Cameroon welcomes the debt-relief and debt-cancellation measures adopted in recent years by the Summit of the Seven as well as by certain developing countries  such as France  Canada  the United States and Belgium.In another sphere  we hope that the interventions of the Common Fund for commodities and the various corrective and compensatory machinery provided for in the new Lomé Convention for the African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries will provide the desired effects.The results of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  to the revitalisation of the economic growth and development of the developing countries and the results of the Paris Conference on the Least-Developed Countries are without any doubt an important milestone in our collective quest for solutions to the international economic crisis.Hone the less  we remain convinced that if they are to have any effect these bilateral initiatives and measures must be integrated in the broader framework of strengthening the North-South dialogue through negotiations in which the focus would be on the interrelationship of the issues of growth  security and development. Hence the importance of the new international development strategy for the fourth development decade  which we trust will be adopted at this session of the Assembly. That strategy will provide an opportunity to gauge the magnitude of the new political will that has resulted from the work of the eighteenth special session  to which I have referred.This applies also to the Uruguay Round of negotiations  which will enter their final phase this December and which will  we hope  lead to the adoption of equitable measures for the strengthening of our countries’ commercial competitiveness.Given the global nature of the threat to the environment and its close relationship to development  it is urgently necessary to define common objectives and adopt appropriate measures.These concerns were echoed in the Pan-African Co-ordination Conference on the environment and lasting development in Africa  to be held in Bamako  Mali  in December 199C  and the proclamation by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) of 1991 as the African Year for the Environment. This is true also of the international Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in 1992.All these gatherings should provide us with an opportunity to seek together ways and means of solving problems such as the shrinking of the ozone layer  drought  pollution  desertification  acid rain and floods  in order better to protect the environment and guarantee the equilibrium of our whole ecosystem.With regard to the negotiations now under way within the framework of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  so far these have made appreciable progress  in particular with regard to the registration of the first pioneer investors and the agreement on the implementation of obligations entered into by those investors and respective certifying States.It is essential  however  to overcome the pending difficulties speedily  in a spirit of compromise  in order to facilitate the entry into force of the Convention  while promoting universal participation in the new legal regime for the seas and oceans.One of the major challenges we must face at the end of this century is that of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The upheavals now taking place throughout the world are evidence of the keen interest in this important question. We welcome the active role played by the United Nation  in this field.The holding within a few days at the Headquarters of our Organization of a World Summit for Children is a further illustration of this kind of activity  which has my government’s full support.In Africa  significant progress has been made in the sphere of human rights. The African Charter of the Rights of Man and Peoples has entered into force  and the Commission charged with monitoring its implementation has been set up.At their recent submit meeting at Addis Ababa the Heads of State and Government of the OAU made an important declaration reaffirming their commitment to the strengthening of democracy and the protection of human rights in Africa.With respect more precisely to democracy  the President of the Republic of Cameroon  Paul Biya  has reminded us that""Democracy is built day by day  and no one is safe from a false move. We are moving through the necessary phases  and doing this at our own pace  taking into account our capabilities and the needs peculiar to our country"". In Cameroon the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  which has always been at the heart of the philosophy and activities the Government of Renewal  has been given significant impetus by the adoption of major measures covering  in particular  the strengthening of freedom of the press  revision of the law on freedom of association to make it more liberal  abolition of emergency legislation  and creation of a human rights commission.Thus  Africa  in general  and Cameroon  in particular  are firmly convinced that the quest for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a universal and legitimate aspiration. But the rights and freedoms  which are certainly powerful factors for development  require in turn for their full blossoming viable economic and social conditions. Therefore there is an undeniable built-in dynamic relationship between human rights  democracy and development.We are now in the midst of a period of fertile historical change reflected in the number of events generated between States and even within nations. While we cannot predict the future with certainty  we can safely believe that mankind now has available to it  thanks to the enormous progress of science and technology  a whole set of means which  when put at the service of our common good  can move us towards a happier future. Each day that passes strengthens the ties between the various parts of our planet. In the light of the numerous challenges facing our age  this calls for collective action and the strengthening of the institutions of interdependence  broad-based agreement and co-operation. In this perspective  the United Nations remains the most appropriate framework in which to harmonise the views of all nations for common purposes. The grave crisis it experienced in the 19308 enabled it to carry out worthwhile reforms to increase its efficiency of operation. It is to be hoped that with renewed political will the Member States will give it the means to work as it should.The fathers of our Organisation conceived - through the purposes  principles and objectives of the Charter - an ideal world based upon peace  international co-operation and the well-being of all. The dawn of the third millennium  by  virtue of the great hopes it has aroused  offers the opportunity so far to enter a decisive phase in the progress of mankind towards that better world."
"30",1432,"COD",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly has begun in political and economic circumstances which are particularly alarming for the international community as a whole. Peaceful solutions to all the questions to be considered during your presidency are hoped for. On behalf of the people of Zaire and its President  Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko  I therefore congratulate you on your unanimous election to this important post in our Organisation. Your outstanding intellectual and moral qualities  coupled with your long experience as a statesman in Malta  are an absolute guarantee of the success of the work of the current session of the General Assembly  I assure you that my delegation is fully prepared to make a positive contribution throughout your term of office.I should like  furthermore  to acknowledge the praiseworthy work done by your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba of the Republic of Nigeria. I feel it my duty to pay a warn tribute to him for the progress he helped our Organisation to make in its constant guest for peace throughout the world and for the dynamism he displayed throughout his term of office.My delegation wishes to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organisation  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts on behalf of international peace and security  efforts that are leading to the peaceful settlement of conflicts throughout the world  and to express its great appreciation to him for the outstanding manner in which he has discharged his difficult functions as the artisan and corner-stone of our Organisation.Having enhanced its prestige and seen its ideals triumph  our Organisation should be proud to count among its Members today the new Republic of Namibia and the Principality of Liechtenstein. Zaire welcomes the presence of the delegations of these two fraternal countries in our midst at the current session and assures them of our co-operation  both in the United Nations and between our respective countries.At a time when a new wind is blowing throughout the world  bringing hope for democratic renewal in Eastern Europe as well as in Africa and Latin America and fostering the emergence of a climate of confidence in East-West and North-South relations  the international community is once again faced with a renewal of tension in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East which challenges the values  the principles and the rules of international law calling for the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Middle East crisis  which  recently  has been marked by the massacre of innocent civilians in the occupied Arab territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - events that fanned the flame of the intifidah - aroused the conscience of the entire world when  on 25 May last  the Security Council was convened in Geneva to consider the situation and to find an appropriate solution. Tension in that part of the world had reached its peak  and no one expected tension to break out in an area so close to a region already troubled by the absence of peace and security since 1945 In the Middle East  Iraq's invasion and illegal occupation of Kuwait are the last straw and justify the presence of naval and air forces from other military Powers in the region. But this presence exposes the entire region to the risk of an armed conflagration  probably to a war  whose victims  once again  would be the innocent - women  children and people who  motivated by a spirit of friendship and co-operation  came from all parts of the world to make their contribution to the development of that desert region.The entire international community  whose representatives are assembled at this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  has been called upon to deal with the crisis and  if possible  to find a peaceful solution. My country will continue to join all peace- and justice-loving members of the Security Council in the search for a peaceful settlement to the conflict  so that the Kuwaiti people may regain the independence of which they have bee  robbed and its sovereignty as a Member of this Organization.At the same time  we must deal with the question of Palestine  which is the crux of the Middle East conflict. We must see to it that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) are implemented in an effective manner  as those resolutions define the conditions for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East - namely  the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force or by war; the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from Arab territories occupied since 1967; the termination of all belligerency; respect for  and recognition of  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area  and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized borders free from threats or acts of force; and the necessity for achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem and for guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area.The Security Council  in resolution 338 (1973)  decided that negotiations between the parties to the fighting in the Middle East should begin immediately  but these people continue to oppose any spirit of dialogue and negotiation. Thus  it is incumbent on the international community to bring about between the protagonists a disposition for peace and discussion  all the while overcoming psychological  historical  legal and other obstacles.Certainly my delegation is convinced that peace requires  first and foremost  justice and equality for the Arab people of Palestine  who  like the people of Israel  have a right to a homeland and a State. This has long been understood by the United Nations General Assembly  which  on 29 November 1947  laid down the principles for a Jewish State and for a Palestinian Arab State by adopting resolution 181 (II)  which contained the Plan of Partition of Palestine. Zaire places its hope in the United Nations  which  within the scope of its historic responsibilities  gave a State to the Jews of the Diaspora and decided on the creation of a Palestinian Arab State  which it must now succeed in setting up. Similarly  the international status of Jerusalem must be safeguarded in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. As for Lebanon  my delegation believes that the General Assembly should constantly follow developments in that country and  in this regard  adopt a firm position - one that would preserve the territorial integrity  unity and sovereignty of the country  so that an end might be put to all external interference and foreign military presence in that State which is a Member of the United Nations. Zaire will work to promote co-operation with Arab countries in the context of South-South relations.Asia  which continues to see tension in Afghanistan  in Cambodia and in the relations between the two Koreas  in spite of the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan and the announced  but not yet verified  withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia  seems to be bogged down in talks  which have not yet led to substantial progress. Indeed  in Afghanistan the conditions of peace that should encourage the return of Afghan refugees  primarily from Pakistan  have not yet been brought about.In Cambodia  the political factions  which met at the initiative of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  as well as in Paris with the co-operation of the permanent members of the Security Council  have not yet managed to achieve satisfactory progress towards the establishment of a democratic State  unified and within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.We welcome also the unification of the two Yemens and  as of 3 October 1990  of the two Germanys. This new era of unification should extend to the two Koreas  whose absence from the United Nations has been a handicap. It has been observed that the United Nations framework enabled both the two Germanys and the two Yemens to embark on fruitful contacts  which were the basis for the negotiations leading to the accords that we all welcome. Therefore my delegation is of the view that admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations  in whatever way they choose  would be likely to accelerate the process of negotiations towards unification.This year 1990 - has been a historic one for Africa. Important events have marked the political life of the continent after 30 years of independence for most of its countries. The freeing of Nelson Mandela  after 27 years of illegal detention in South African prisons  the independence of Namibia  obtained at the cost of great loss of human life  the victorious struggle waged by the South West Africa People's Organization  which the international community supported in every possible way  and  finally  the democratization process that gave pride of place to a multi-party system in many countries  including my own  illustrate that 1990 has been a political turning-point for Africa as a whole.There is no doubt that an unprecedented economic recession  compounded by the weight of external indebtedness  has characterized the African economy  in spite of the praiseworthy efforts made by a substantial number of African Governments in the framework of structural adjustment and of agreements with the International Monetary Fund.The progress that has been achieved in the political sphere has  however  met the hopes of the African peoples. Indeed  the political changes currently under way in Africa  with a view to the increased democratization of its institutions  are justified  on one hand  by a wave of democratic renewal  which has swept over the countries of Eastern Europe  and  on the other hand  by the determination of African peoples to enter into a new period of democracy in which the participation of all Africans in the management of public affairs will be increased. In Zaire  specific action has been taken  after broad consultations of the population  conducted by the Head of State  to advance towards democratic reforms  which should lead towards the Third Republic. It was solely the political will of the Zairian people that underlay the adoption of a multi-party system; no foreign State brought any pressure whatsoever to bear. This new path chosen by the Zairian people can in no wise be interpreted as being the result of any concession made in order to obtain additional official development aid; the decision was taken by the Zairian people itself.It should be stated in this regard that no linkage should be attempted between aid and democracy in Africa  for that might draw the economic  trading and co-operation relations between Africa and its foreign partners into a new style of international relations  one based on diktat.At this point I should like to appeal to the international community: all peace-loving and justice-loving States should show their solidarity and increase their co-operation with African States  so that Africa will not be marginalized  to the advantage of other regions of the world  at a time when all African States want to make fundamental changes in the political and economic orders in their countries.In southern Africa  the granting of independence to Namibia on 21 March  which expanded the frontiers of freedom in Africa  was cause for justifiable pride for the whole continent. The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) won the elections in Namibia by democratic means and raised to the highest position in the land a valiant son of Africa  the uncontested leader of SWAPO  now the first President of the Republic of Namibia  Mr. Sam Nujoma. On behalf of the Zairian Government and people  I should like to pay a resounding tribute to him and to our brothers  the people of Namibia  for having overcome the illegal occupation of Namibia and freed their country from the colonial yoke. Bordering this new independent State  there are new political developments under way since the accession to power of President De Klerk and the freeing on 11 February of Nelson Mandela  a worthy and distinguished son of Africa who embodies in his own person the struggle against racial discrimination  racism and apartheid. The steps taken so far by President De Klerk are  in our view  a prelude to the radical changes which must be made towards the total dismantling of apartheid in South Africa. Zaire wishes to reaffirm its solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa and give assurance of its total support in this crucial phase of the struggle.Zaire stands beside that indomitable fighter for the freedom and equality of peoples  Nelson Mandela  and pays him a well-deserved tribute for his courage  far-sightedness and unselfishness  which will leave an indelible mark on the history of his country.Zaire will support any action the General Assembly may plan with a view to speeding up the effective implementation of the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session  devoted to apartheid. My country believes in dialogue  and particularly in the one which has just been launched by President De Klerk and the Vice-President of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  Nelson Mandela  between the two communities in South Africa  white and black  a dialogue which should lead to the total eradication of apartheid and the advent of a democratic and non-racial society in South Africa.The recent confrontations which have pitted blacks against each other should end  and in their place there should be coherent  co-ordinated and well-orchestrated action by the black leaders round the flag of an undisputed leader able to represent the black community as a whole in the negotiations which have now begun. In northern Africa  more specifically in Western Sahara  the Secretary-General is continuing his efforts  which we firmly support  for the holding of a referendum there. My delegation wishes the Secretary-General complete success in achieving that objective.If there is one area which is closely bound up with the economic and social development of third-world countries  it is disarmament. General and complete disarmament  as it is construed in the Declaration of the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  no longer seems merely an ideal to be pursued by Member States thanks to the relaxation in international relations between East and West that began in Washington on 7 December 1987  when the United States of America and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  which was ratified in June 1988.In the area of multilateral negotiations  tangible results have been achieved in the area of chemical weapons  and we understand that the draft convention prohibiting the production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is to be finalised by the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva in the near future.We all know that the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  held in New York between 16 and 20 April of this year  devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  to revitalising growth and development in the developing countries  challenged the international community when it declared that: ""In an increasingly interdependent world  the developing countries should play an important role in the growth and expansion of the world economy for the progress and prosperity of all peoples."" fA S-18 l4. p. 5. para. 31. It also asked Member States to be prepared  in a new spirit of solidarity  to demonstrate a new will to act at the international level in an integrated manner in order to improve the international economic environment and to speed the expansion of the world economy and the economic growth of the developing countries.In the face of the internal and external factors which hinder development in under-equipped countries  my delegation believes that the establishment by the international community of a consistent investment policy in the developing countries could increase their productive capacity and help them  through increased exports  to obtain more substantial currency resources for financing their own development and for paying off their external debts.In this way  the climate of confidence created by the democratisation process which has begun in most third-world countries could turn out to be a factor of fundamental importance in promoting North-South relations and could encourage the release of new technologies to benefit those countries  in the form of partnerships or joint ventures.In dealing with the debt issue  it should be pointed out that the management of public and private indebtedness has been made more difficult by the extreme instability of interest and exchange rates. In the face of that instability  the financial markets have developed a number of techniques  first called the Baker Plan and later the Brady Plan  to enable debtors to defer payments  reduce costs and decrease the likelihood of unpleasant surprises caused by changes in interest and exchange rates. The Baker Plan  which was based on the hypothesis of more rapid economic growth to enable debtor countries to solve their indebtedness problems  did not bear fruit for the simple reason that it was based on the low export earnings of the debtor countries in international markets caused especially by protectionist measures and the reduction in direct investment flows  not to speak of stagnation and external assistance  which led to a slowing down of economic growth rates and even to negative growth rates in many cases.Our appeal for investment is thus largely justified by this analysis: by the end of 1989  the total indebtedness of all the developing countries had reached $1.290 billion  of which $264 billion was African.With a view to finding some grounds for understanding in dealing with the environment and development  we should mention a graver threat to our planet  the risk of the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing a greenhouse effect. An increase in the planet's average temperature will lead to a change in rainfall levels and a deterioration in crop conditions in the major temperate and grain-producing areas.In this respect  my country joined in the Hague Declaration on the depletion of the ozone layer and on atmospheric pollution and climate change. It supports the development of a framework convention in order to preserve our planet and the future of mankind.Zaire  which has 47 per cent of Africa's tropical forests within its territory  is helping to protect the natural environment by increasing to 15 per cent of its territory the protected reserves where rare species such as the okapi  the white rhinoceros and the gorilla live in full freedom.As one of the countries that initiated the World Charter for Nature  Zaire has set up a national committee to follow up on the preparatory work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992. Furthermore  Zaire supports the proposal to strengthen the role of the United Nations Environment Programme. The Programme's impact can only be more visible with the creation of subregional representation and with participation at the grassroots level in the world effort to protect the environment.Last weekend the World Summit for Children gave special attention to the needs and protection of children and the consideration that should be given to every child in the world. My delegation fully agrees with the principle that every child has the right to enjoy all the rights recognized and guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights without any distinction as to race  ethnic group  colour  sex  language  religion  political views or other opinions  and without any such distinction with regard to a child's parents or legal guardian. That is why my country duly appreciates the World Summit of Heads of State and Government just held at the Headquarters of the Organization with a view to expressing most solemnly the support of all nations for respect for children's rights. It should be pointed out that the Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed by my country  which has already ratified it.In conclusion  I reaffirm on behalf of my delegation  and on my own behalf  the dedication of my country  Zaire  to the principle of the sovereign equality of Member States as laid down in the United Nations Charter. There is no need here perhaps to recall once again that pursuant to the Charter of our Organization Member States have proclaimed their faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human parson and in equal rights for men and women  and have declared themselves resolved to foster social progress and to establish better living conditions in greater freedom. Zaire intends to continue its active participation in the activities of the United Nations  whose role would seem to be decisive in the area of international peace and security. As a member of the Security Council and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Zaire will spare no effort to bring about the triumph of right  justice  equity and equality  all of which underpin any activity of our Organisation to safeguard peace throughout the world.The encouraging results of the efforts of all mankind show that  given the concern and determination of all  international peace and security can be maintained  h positive overview  however minimal  makes us optimistic for the future. May this forty-fifth session help to increase such optimism."
"31",1478,"COG",45,1990,"﻿The convening of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly gives me an opportunity to pay a tribute to the efforts recently made by our world Organisation and by the international community as a whole to establish a climate of peace in the world and to promote the virtues of dialogue and Mediation  Indeed  the search for peace and the willingness to engage in a dialogue have been an ongoing preoccupation with regard to relations between States. Thanks to those efforts  numerous conflicts have been ended and the climate of dialogue  which until recently did not exist  has been established throughout the world. We are therefore seeing the dawn of a new era  a more promising one  in which dialogue and Joint efforts will prevail over confrontation. Never in the post-war period has the climate of international relations been so favourable  despite the regrettable presence of some hotbeds of tension. Never in the history of humanity has such significant progress been achieved in such a short times by States: this is proof of their capacity to act constructively in the search for solutions to the vital problems in our universe and also their capacity to meet the numerous challenges facing us.It is in this global context of peace and understanding among nations that I would like  on behalf of the Congolese delegation and on my own behalf  to congratulate you  Sir  most sincerely on your unanimous election to the presidency of our General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your outstanding qualities  as well as the esteem and the consideration which you enjoy in the international community  are sure guarantees of the success of the present session.May I also pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Joseph Garba  your predecessor  for the dynamism  clarity and firmness with which he guided the debate of the forty-fourth session. Finally  we wish to congratulate Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  our Secretary-General  for all his efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations and to create the conditions necessary for the establishment of peace in the world.We should like  first of all  to warmly welcome the delegation of Liechtenstein  which has just been admitted as the 160th State Member of the United Nations. In adhering to the Charter  that country is strengthening the universality of the Organisation and reinforcing the principle that the United Nations is based on the sovereign equality of all its Members. The People's Republic of the Congo  which spares no effort in contributing to the peaceful solution of conflicts and the strengthening of détente in the world  has welcomed with real satisfaction Namibia's accession to independence. We pay a tribute to its admission to the United Nations. My delegation takes this opportunity once again to assure Namibia  the youngest democracy on our continent  of our availability and complete co-operation both multilaterally and bilaterally.The annual gathering of the representatives of the States all over the world always affords a favourable occasion to think about the relationships among nations. Clearly  the goals enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations have not yet been fully achieved  but because of the climate of detente that prevails at the present time we can hope and believe that the conditions are there for the establishment of an era of peace and true co-operation among States.We all know that the quest for peace is a sacred cause. Thus it is appropriate that we should devote all our energies and our good will to it because it requires determination and persistence. Undoubtedly there will be moments of despair  when tensions flare up or subside  but we know that our unending work is a collective effort and it can only progress if all Member States are mobilised. Therefore it is with the same determination and the same hopes that we must deal with various conflicts and ease the hotbeds of tension that break out in different areas.My country appreciates the positive attitude we have recently seen in the efforts made by the United Nations to resolve the serious crisis in the Gulf  which was caused by the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. The vital need for the commitment of Member States to the ideals of the United Nations could not be demonstrated more clearly  especially their commitment to respect for international law  which protects the weak against the strong and guarantees international security and stability. In this unending quest for peace  the Congo  like other countries  welcomes the fact that the United Nations - this voice which has often been heard crying in the wilderness - has now  as the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization emphasizes  ""gained a volume and resonance it lacked before"". (А/45/Łf Pt	it)The tangible progress in East-West détente has dispelled the communist spectre of another course of action. This progress now causes less apprehension as regards the idea of restructuring the world and day by day dispels the fear of a recurrence of a dreadful past. While the search for peace has been of concern to the international community  profound changes are also taking place in the world that clearly show the lofty aspirations of peoples to enjoy greater democracy and freedom  λ vibrant new chapter and a true political turning-point occurred in Europe on 3 October 1990  when Germany regained its sovereignty as one State  and with it the right to participate in a military alliance of its choice. The Congo warmly pays a tribute to Germany  a country with which we are bound by many ties of friendship and co-operation. Similar expressions of national claims in the heart of Europe have removed the apparently fixed centralised political structures. The winds of freedom have blown over Eastern and Central Europe.My country appreciates also the unification of the two Yemens and supports the initiatives taken by North Korea and South Korea with a view to their reunification without any foreign interference.In Africa the process is not an insignificant occurrence. The movement towards greater freedom and democratisation of political life also affects African societies. The establishment of free institutions bas become а universal aspiration. It remains for each people to find the capacity to organise and to adapt those changes to its own level of development and in accordance with its own cultural values. To mark its commitment to democratic values and respect for him and rights  the government of the People's Republic of the Congo has released all political prisoners. Similarly  the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party  under the direction of President Denis Sassou Nguesso  in response to the aspirations of the Congolese people to freedom and democracy  decided  at the end of its fourth special session - which was held at Brazzaville from 28 to 30 September 1990 - immediately to set up a multi-party system to allow for greater public participation in the management of public affairs. The various measures taken have already strengthened the prospects for this  especially the starting of work on amendments to the Constitution and the preparation of laws on political parties and on freedom of movement and freedom of expression  guaranteed the leaders of the various schools of thought.In our country  where over 90 per cent of the relevant age group goes to school and where there are noteworthy traditions in the areas of literacy and cultural and artistic activity  the measures which have just been adopted to guarantee strict respect for individual and collective freedoms will give democracy wider scope and develop it on the basis of the immense work our country has done in this area. Everyone knows that the Congo is one of those countries which attach fundamental importance to the notion of education for all  because to educate a people is to prepare it to assume responsibility for its destiny and provide it with the knowledge and critical mind needed to exercise democracy.On this soil  fertilised by the ideas of progress and openness to the problems of the world - as we can see from the considerable number of international conferences held in Brazzaville - poets  historians  men of letters  theatre people and talented researchers disseminate  in their works  ideas to improve self-awareness and knowledge of the national and international political  economic and socio-cultural environments. Thus equipped  young people and workers in the city and in the countryside long ago organised themselves into associations to make their voices heard in the quest for solutions to our country's problems and to defend their interests.Today we are witnessing a flowering of the values which are likely to stimulate private initiative  especially in the economic field  where the liberalisation measures in force for some years now have created a favourable framework for domestic and foreign private investment. These measures will lend greater vitality to the democratic values which are already rooted in all strata of society in my country.This is how the new era is beginning. Because of the contribution made by each and every Congolese  and with the support of our partners in the international community  the Congo will give itself a new political landscape which will favour the harmonious development of the country and the well-being of its peoples. The Congo  by using all the energies  freedoms and talents of all its sons and daughters  should make democracy a factor in the country1 s development.May this work be carried out in national peace and concord  because that is the wish of its peoples; may it take place without the process now under way being threatened by the adjustment measures  which have been undertaken in an adverse international economic context and which can only be measured in terms of high social costs and political instability. Despite the difficulties which characterise any human endeavour and the scale of the challenge the Congo must meet  the process is irreversible. It is following its course in a climate of regained national peace and cohesion.Now that the walls and ancient barriers left by the Second World War are falling  we are witnessing and participating in the rise of a new era where confrontation is giving way to dialogue and joint efforts  an era where States are ceasing to see the world  determine their priorities and take certain actions viewed through the warped lens of the cold war  happily now broken. Because the world is gradually freeing itself of the balance of terror  of the feared face-off between the military blocs  the effects are being felt in the most distant lands and in situations which were once set in stone. A previous speaker from this rostrum rightly hailed the end of the East-West conflict as a victory for reason and the sense of responsibility.The Congo has welcomed the fortunate conclusions of the Soviet-American summits  particularly the declarations concerning strategic arms reductions  the protocols on ending nuclear tests and the agreement to reduce chemical-weapon stockpiles. The Congo is also happy that several issues in international affairs are now being looked at in a new light. The issue of security in Europe is benefiting strongly from the unification of Germany and a context which is finally truly pan-European.In South Africa  Nelson Mandela  the world’s most famous political prisoner  was set free on 11 February 1990. This was redress for a flagrant injustice and  at the same time  a significant victory in the African peoples  struggle for peace and for human liberty and dignity  but also for the universal resistance against oppression. We are convinced that Nelson Mandela will use his great wisdom and rich fund of experience in the service of peace in his country  and for the triumph of those ideals for which our Organisation has always selflessly worked.While it is true that talks between Nelson Mandela  Vice-President of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  and the South African Government with a view to negotiating a non-racial  democratic South Africa have begun and are continuing  it is regrettable that the five pillars of apartheid remain intact and that the conditions needed for a favourable new political climate have scarcely been created in South African society. Today  it is more necessary than ever before to mobilize the international community and further increase awareness of the need to keep up sanctions of all kinds against the Pretoria regime so - apartheid system can finally be eradicated.In Angola and in Mozambique  direct negotiations between the Government the opposition must be encouraged and supported. This is true also of all the initiatives towards restoring peace in Liberia. My country also supports the peace processes under United Nations auspices now under way in Western Sahara and in Cambodia.In the Middle East  the Palestinian people is continuing its difficult quest for its rights to be recognised and for its identity to be affirmed. Even while the world's attention is riveted on the Gulf crisis  the Palestinian question persists  threatening stability and security in the subregion. The Congo remains convinced that only an international conference held under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  would reach a negotiated  just and lasting solution.Despite everything  the cause of peace moves forward  and our Assembly is good witness to that. The cause of peace progresses through multilateral and bilateral dialogue  through the will of States to renounce war in settling disputes  through the actions of the United Nations wherever it is called upon to mediate. The Congo intends to involve itself fully in this constantly renewed project  and in doing so it will play it  appropriate part. Unfortunately  this work of peace cannot be separated from the struggle against the disparities which characterise the world. We should ensure that world growth is better shared and more balanced and is directed more towards the elimination of poverty in countries feebly endowed by nature  battered by history or weighed down by debt.The external-debt question remains fundamental  despite the constant study it has received at both the national and the international levels. We fully appreciate all the decisions taken so far with a view to solving the problem. Nevertheless  the international community must continue to recognise that the debt burden of the developing countries is becoming heavier and heavier. Indeed  from $600 billion at the beginning of the decade  it will reach $ l 246 billion at the end of this year.As far as Africa is concerned  the figures are just as striking  $250 billion in 1990 as compared with $230 billion in 1989. It is true that the volume of African debt is smaller  but it should be pointed out that the debt and the debt-servicing ratios have increased much more quickly than in any other group of countries. In comparison with the gross national product  for example  the debt ratio of the sub-Saharan African countries is almost twice as high as that of countries of the world which are heavily in debt. External debt dearly is a real obstacle to the continent's economic recovery and development. It hinders all development efforts  especially those the African countries are undertaking to improve their own infrastructures  notably in the areas of health and education.The international community is certainly concerned  although the measures adopted so far have proved insufficient in view of the scope of the crisis. In this regard  the new initiatives for the reduction of debt are of interest to us  especially the recent decision  taken at the summit meeting of the Beads of State of France and Africa held last June in La Baule  in France  in favour of the middle-income countries  including Congo. However  my delegation believes it essential to consider the relevant suggestions in the common African position on the indebtedness crisis. These suggestions deserve more attention by the international community.Furthermore  this effort to achieve a final settlement of Africa's external-debt crisis requires energetic and bold decisions within the framework of a strategy based on co-operation  negotiation and collective responsibility. For the implementation of such a strategy  Africa has proposed to the international community the convening of an international conference on the African debt.Without any doubt  there are many challenges  which will be difficult to meet unless massive and effective support is given by the international community.Over and above the external debt crisis  which has been worsened by the reverse flow of capital from the developing countries to the developed countries  the renewal of growth in developing countries is still accompanied by the constant lowering of the prices of raw materials. Indeed  the fall in export income  which is the main resource of developing countries  is compromising the whole outlook for development. For that reason  my country has been following with much interest the Uruguay Round of negotiations  which is scheduled to be completed at the end of this year. A positive outcome of those negotiations would mark the beginning of a new era of global co-operation  with an increased awareness of mutual interests and of the responsibilities shared by all nations.The persistent worsening of the critical economic and social situation in Africa led the General Assembly in 1986 to reorient the joint efforts of the international community towards an international covenant between Africa and the rest of the world. Its goal was to free that region from its plight and to set it firmly on the road to economic recovery and development. Subsequently the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 was adopted. Without anticipating the evaluation planned for the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  one may easily observe that  five years after the implementation of the Programme of Action  the economic and social situation of the African countries has worsened. The economic forecasts provide a sombre and unpromising outlook as regards the drastic reform and adjustment measures at present under way. Therefore the international community must help the African countries reduce the human cost of adjustment and must commit itself to the establishment of external conditions favourable to the resumption of growth and development. This is an urgent and decisive matter. Africa is determined  in this context  to pursue these reforms  which can help it to reverse its disastrous economic and social decline.Today we must have a new  constructive vision which makes possible a restructuring of the world economic system. For that reason we hail the conclusions of the work of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to international co-operation  and more particularly to the growth of the developing countries. That work has made it possible to envisage specific measures likely to achieve more balanced international economic relations.In the same spirit  my country welcomes the recent adoption of the new International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. This new framework of co-operation should make it possible to redress the imbalances in the international economic system and to promote a fair and equitable sharing of the heritage of mankind. Otherwise  the détente we are now experiencing will be fragile and tenuous if it does not open up genuine prospects for the developing countries' development and progress.Environmental problems affect our entire planet. Many speakers have mentioned this important subject and have referred to its many aspects  such as water pollution  air pollution  the progressive depletion of the ozone layer  soil degradation  deforestation  desertification  the excessive destruction of numerous rare species and  more recently  the overt or covert attempts to dump toxic wastes in Africa.We must consider the struggle against environmental degradation as being an integral part of the struggle that the international community must carry on to revitalise economic growth and development. For that reason  Congo has welcomed the scheduled convening in 1992 in Brazil of the international Conference on Environment and Development. We are convinced that that Conference will contribute to the examination and adoption of the necessary provisions of a world strategy for environmental survival.Independently of the results expected from that Conference  my country has for several years now had a specific governmental structure for environmental matters  and has proclaimed 6 March as ""National Tree Day"". At the same time  it has drafted an environment code that is strict in terms of the standards it defines and the sanctions it calls for. Moreover  in keeping with its commitment  Congo this year acted as host to a conference on the conservation of forest ecosystems in the Central African region. In view of the need to strengthen co-operation to safeguard the ecosystems  the conference adopted a regional plan of action which. Inter alia  seeks to protect our forest heritage  to strengthen the technical equipment and forest legislation to limit the destruction of protected species  and also to provide for the training of personnel. While the industrialized countries have been enjoying uninterrupted growth for eight years  the Majority of the developing countries have been stagnating or even falling back. Analysts agree that extreme poverty is rampant among 4 billion people at the same time as 800 million people are bathing in abundance.Poverty  a source· of tension within our societies and beyond our frontiers  is assailing the developing countries  with its attendant woes of malnutrition  sickness and illiteracy  but it does not spare the industrialised world  which have its own social disparities. The decade of the 1980s  now coming to an end  is leaving the developing world & legacy of more than 1 billion people living in absolute poverty  and our African continent remains its favourite target. Indeed  conditions in Africa are such that in years to come we may see there a dangerously explosive situation  both socially and politically  as was recently emphasised by an eminent person from the Commission of European Communities. The international community cannot remain indifferent to that situation. An urgent response must be provided.Terrorism is one of the most deplorable phenomena of the century which is now snaring its close. My country is safe from it. For that reason  it is in everybody's interest to join forces and relentlessly fight terrorist acts  whether carried out by organised groups or by individuals. The Congo  which has been stricken more than once by terrorist madness  recently erected a monument in memory of the 49 Congolese victims of the explosion of the DC-10 aircraft owned by Union de Transports Africannes (OTA) in September 1989. Henceforth  19 May will be known in the Congo as the ""Day of Struggle against Terrorism"".Africa  hitherto spared  has now become a target of illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse. The fatal effects of that scourge now afflict ovary society  rich or poor. The Congo takes this opportunity to renew its commitments to the conclusions of the last special session of the General Assembly devoted to drugs  and once again appeals to the international community to give Africa the necessary technical and financial assistance to halt that scourge.It is reassuring to note that at the dawn of the hope-filled third millennium  the world is undergoing profound changes  but those changes would be meaningless without an affirmation of the international community’s collective awareness of the common destiny of all peoples and all States. More than any other organisation  the United Nations has been able to embody the principle of universality; within our Organisation  nations can act together to take up the major challenges of the modern world and maintain unity and solidarity with one another. By co-operating within the United Nations  our nations and peoples will have honoured their commitment to the Charter. They will thus have worked for the rapprochement of men and peoples whose legitimate aspiration is to live in harmony in a world of peace  democracy  justice and social progress.That is why today everyone is looking with optimism and hope to our Organisation at this last session of the 1980s."
"32",1525,"COL",45,1990,"﻿At the outset  I should like to make a special appeal to all the countries represented here in the name of a country which has demonstrated its resolve to withstand the most cowardly and inhumane form of violence. I call on every one of you to make one last effort  an effort to seek a new formula and exhaust all avenues of reason and intelligence in order to achieve peace in the Persian Gulf. We must attempt to rescue thousands from the risk of death and desolation. If  at the end of the process  folly wins the day and the use of force becomes necessary  let it be clear that it will be because of the intransigence of those who resorted to violence and not because of a lack of will or generosity on the part of those of us who truly believe that the only worthwhile victory is the triumph of life and peace.I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the Assembly. Your country  although a small one  has always played a key role in this institution. I would also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Garba for his splendid work at the last session. I would also like to pay a tribute to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar  a distinguished Latin American  for his excellent leadership at the helm of this institution. Colombia joins in greeting Liechtenstein and the new Yemen  both sitting for the first time as full Members of this Assembly.Each time that a Colombian Head of State addresses the Assembly  he has begun by reading a long list of names of important officials - young leaders  judges  soldiers and policemen - who have lost their lives at the hands of the drug traffickers. This list was followed by a call for concerted action by all nations to stand with Colombia against the drug scourge. We have made this call because Colombia has paid the highest price in this struggle. That list of names has increased significantly since former President Virgilio Barco spoke to this Assembly less than one year ago.Today  I am not going to read the list. I would however like to tell the world that today the list is even longer and bloodier than ever. We still face very difficult days ahead.In the course of the last electoral campaign alone  the drug terrorists assassinated three presidential candidates  including Luis Carlos Galan  my friend  and the candidate I was associated with as campaign manager. This is what has happened as far as our political leaders are concerned. It is  however  the civilian population  ordinary Colombians  who are paying the highest price.The drug terrorists have placed dozens of car bombs in the streets of our cities. On the day we innocently celebrate as Mother's Day in Colombia  cars filled with dynamite exploded at shopping centres crowded with children. Many of them lost their lives. A commercial airplane exploded over Bogota because of a high-powered bomb placed under a seat by drug terrorists. The building which housed the administrative security department was entirely demolished by a blast of a ton of dynamite placed inside a bus. The terrorists offered to pay the sum of 2 million pesos  almost $4 000  for each policeman killed. Close to 300 policemen were murdered by the paid assassins. It was thus that Colombians came to realise that our mourning would be more frequent than everyone else's.In today's world addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations is a significant event in the life of any public figure. It is a unique and splendid opportunity to address all the peoples of the world. I believe that my commitment to this audience and this institution requires me to say something useful and meaningful. It should be something that adds to the experience of the Assembly  an organisation endowed by its founders with the unique quality of bringing together all the peoples  all the cultures  all the religions that encompass and guide the human race.It may be useful to recall the words spoken by William Faulkner 47 years ago  when he addressed the Swedish Academy:""One should teach oneself that there is nothing more disgraceful than to be afraid.""Colombia is not a powerful country; it is not a wealthy country. Our wealth and our power come from the tenacity with which we maintain our democratic ideals and with which we adhere to the Charter of the United Nations. Our belief and our firm attachment to those fundamental values are our real strength.Optimism over the inevitable advance of democracy and freedom should not  however  blind us to the obstacles to world stability.With the abatement of the East-West conflict  which for more than 40 years hung over us like a spectre of war  it is becoming clear that peace does not depend on avoiding the nuclear annihilation of humanity. Today the conflicts and threats that hang over the world community are of another kind  one that is no less dangerous than the arms race or the overweening belligerence between the super-Powers. As the Secretary-General stated in his report:""The Charter of the United Nations governs relations between States. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights pertains to relations between the State and the individual. The time has come to devise a covenant regulating relations between humankind and nature."" (A 4SS1. p. 22)Colombia has one of the widest biological bases in the world. In our country there is unique wealth as regards the presence and variety of vegetable and animal species. We believe that that heritage is our own but it also belongs to all of mankind. For this reason in the Orinoquia and the Amazon we have protected an area larger in size than Great Britain. But the responsibility and the cost of preserving the environment should not rest solely on those developing countries that still have the luxury of possessing vast forests and virgin lands. It is inadmissible that those industrialised countries that devastated and continue to exploit natural resources  within the framework of unbridled development  are trying to shirk their responsibilities. The industrialised world has an ecological debt to mankind.There is on the horizon a dangerous threat of ecological disaster for the developing world imposed by those countries that are primarily responsible for the deterioration of the world environment. If we do not act soon to find more effective machinery within a multilateral framework  the question of the environment will become a new source of conflict between North and South. Colombia will therefore participate actively in the preparation of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992.There are other threats to peace and stability  particularly for the developing countries  and 1 am referring to the conventional arms race and the illegal traffic in drugs. Colombia has repeatedly stressed the latter because we have personal experience of the carnage it causes. We hope that nest year the General Assembly will adopt the recommendations of the group of experts crested at the request of my country  which is now working on this subject.Nor can we disregard the significance of the deliberations of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).We hope that the developing countries will concede the liberalization of commercial services  telecommunications and high technology and that at the same time there will be a real opening up of markets for agricultural goods in the industrialized countries  which at present are scanty and not very significant. This imbalance could endanger continuation of the multilateral trade negotiations.I am sure that at the World Summit for Children  at which so many world leaders will be brought together  with the signing of the final act we will give great momentum to work being done for children and young people throughout the world. My nine-year-old child accompanied me here so that he will be able to bear witness to the efforts that Governments and leaders are making.The conflict in the Persian Gulf is the greatest threat to world peace in recent times. But paradoxically it gives us an opportunity further to develop detente throughout the world. If the world can stand as one in confronting all acts of aggression and violations of international law and human rights  by whatever aggressor nation  then we shall establish a precedent for co-operation that can serve to bring about stability. On relations with the community of nations are constantly guided by the principles that guarantee civilised coexistence among peoples. Defence of and respect for human rights  the legal equality of States  the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for rejection of the use of force  and above all non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples - they are the principles that guide our international policies. They give us an active mandate which  as a clear expression of those convictions  determines our actions in the Security Council and in multilateral organisations.We do not believe it is possible to build peace without pluralism  without tolerance for others’ ideas. That is what we believe in Colombia  and that is why Mr. Antonio Havarro Holf now serves on our Council of Ministers  while barely six months ago he was taking up arms and fighting as a member of the M-19 guerrilla group. Like the hundreds of former guerrillas of that now demobilised insurgent group  he has found in Colombia a climate in which he can leave the armed struggle without renouncing his ideals of social change. The seriousness of his commitment deserves firm electoral support.I should like to recall that in recent times violence has knocked at the door of every Colombian and has sorely tried the character of the nation. Those who advocate violence failed to realize that our country would rise up in the face of adversity; that in the face of death and suffering  life and hope become greater. Colombians responded to bullets and bombs by voting. They went to the polls and overwhelmingly voted in favour of a democratic and peaceful country.Drug trafficking may not be as tangible a threat to peace as tanks and combat aircraft  but it is just as real and no less devastating. It has become one of the worst enemies of social integrity and democratic stability. Sooner or later  we will uproot drug trafficking  but if the rest of the international community does not make sacrifices similar to those of Colombia  mankind will never be free of its ferocious grip.A considerable portion of the billions of dollars drug consumers pay to dealers ends up in the hands of the drug-traffic terrorists who violate the right to life and threaten our institutions. But we have learned to give no quarter to organized terrorism. Drug trafficking is primarily responsible for violations of human rights in countries where traffickers are active.The world community has been able to activate global co-operation to face possible war and to defend international law. We have in less than a month mobilized enormous war power from one end of the world to the other  and if we can do that I am convinced we are able similarly to achieve satisfactory results in the fight against drug trafficking.No other nation has fought drug trafficking and its organizations more than Colombia. No other nation has obtained the results Colombia has achieved. In this long struggle  we have struck heavy blows against the drug traffickers and their terrorist structure.A highly significant percentage of all cocaine seized and destroyed in the world has been the work of the Colombian authorities. This is reflected in the considerable increase in drug prices in the streets of this city as well as in the poor neighbourhoods of Washington  DC. At the other end of the chain  coca-leaf prices have plummeted below the cost of production.As long as demand does not decrease in the developed world  there will always be more laboratories and the drug traffickers will become increasingly wealthy  regardless of their nationality. To be sure  there are some encouraging signs. The measures adopted by President George Bush against drug use in the United States are beginning to show results at middle-income levels. That is why  following inexorable market forces  the drug traffic is shifting towards other countries and regions  such as Europe and part of Asia. We do not want even to think about the consequences in Colombia and in high-income countries  such as Japan or the European nations  of a demand for drugs  such as that of the United States.We have before us a great opportunity. If we take advantage of the current low prices of the coca leaf to push for a massive alternative crop development  and if the world community acts promptly and takes harsh measures to break the other links of the chain  such as the laundering of dollars  the traffic in precursor chemical products and weapons  and increased consumption  it is possible we may then be close to adopting a policy capable of putting an end to this phenomenon.Colombia actively promotes initiatives which seek concerted international action against the laundering of dollars and the trade in the dangerous precursor chemicals used in the processing of cocaine. We support the call for world conferences to address these important issues in the fight against drugs.The war on drugs cannot  however  be the sole responsibility of one country or even a small group of countries. Drug trafficking is fed by a network of activities that cross every boundary on the planet and involves  in one way or the other  almost all nations. No one is safe from this threat. Until we have definitively defeated this enemy all over the world  without exception  nobody can rest assured that his sons and daughters will be free of this vice and violence engendered by drugs.Colombia considers especially important the creation of an international penal jurisdiction in the fight against drug trafficking. That is why we view with the greatest interest discussions on this issue in the International Juridical Committee. Drug trafficking is  then  an activity which requires multilateral solutions. It is not enough that the United States  Peru  Bolivia and Colombia - the signatories to the Declaration of Cartagena - are resolute in their willingness to face the problem. To be effective  all countries must be involved. No institution is better suited to the task than the United Nations. For this reason  we support the United Nations current effort to evaluate the work being carried out by its bodies in the area of narcotics. It is necessary to create a single authority within the United Nations with sufficient capacity to face the problem. We expect to play a leading role in such a forum  and we seek to participate actively  regardless of the institutional mechanism finally adopted.In the light of the recent crisis in the Persian Gulf  President Bush requested and obtained economic assistance to offset the costs of the United States effort and thus help guarantee the effectiveness of the United Nations decisions.Fighting an enemy even more dangerous to humanity  Colombia has received repeated expressions of solidarity  but very few real measures of support. While nations have demonstrated their economic support for the United States  on the other side of the world  Colombia  fighting against that other enemy of humanity and suffering economic and social hardship has  in fact  received no compensation at all.It is time that repeatedly announced initiatives be converted into concrete actions. We are waiting for the European Economic Community to translate into concrete action its offers to help Colombia and the other Andean nations. We have been awaiting the adoption of the preferential trade system for the countries that signed the Declaration of Cartagena  also known as the Andean Initiative  and its prompt approval by the Congress of the United States. We hope  too  that there will be initiatives in this area by Japan and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations.We would like to see  within the framework of the Initiative for the Americas  the adoption of a special and speedy procedure of negotiations with those countries most seriously affected because of their firm stand against drug trafficking. Our military  judges and policemen know how to do their jobs. They have received minimal specific aid. We are grateful for that aid  but we insist there is a need for solidarity with the Colombian people  who have borne the brunt of this struggle. Friends of the United Nations  let us consider for α moment the role of principles in world events. In the Persian Gulf the principle of non-aggression has united the most diverse countries in the world and consolidated the power of the Security Council as an organ designed to impose international law.In Central and Eastern Europe  where emerging democracies experienced oppression in the past  freedom and democracy have blossomed into a revolution of great historical significance.In South Africa  the discussions between Nelson Mandela  who was recently released  and the Government are opening a window of hope that the principle of the equality of men  regardless of race  shall prevail.In Chile  millions of citizens said no to the dictatorship  and chose representative democracy instead.In Nicaragua  the Sandinista regime honoured its electoral promises.Throughout Latin America  the principle of democracy is being applied with new strength and vigour.In Colombia  the people have faith in the future  and have turned optimism into one more reason to continue struggling for peace. We are the Latin American country with the most marked growth in this past decade  and we are continuing to grow. Our democratic principles  tolerance  freedom and respect for the ideas of others continue to strengthen in spite of attacks from violent sectors.We are speaking about major achievements that seemed unlikely a few years ago. These are exciting times  when sew leadership based on old principles is coming into bloom everywhere.Within this greet setting^ and under the aegis of this Assembly  rests the responsibility of keeping this flower alive  of caring for its fragile roots and protecting it whatever the cost. As a tribute of my people  I bring the Assembly its affirmation of an ambitious and comforting rule: courage does pay off. Colombians are willing to defend their right to live free of fear. Colombians will never surrender their basic principles. Colombians will continue to defend their most sacred values in the face of violence  whether or not they stand alone in the world.As I learned from the words of a peasant of my country  ""The most beautiful flowers of the garden may be destroyed  but nothing can stop the arrival of spring."""
"33",1566,"COM",45,1990,"﻿Sir  it is with great pleasure that I convey to you  an islander like ourselves  the warm congratulations of the people and Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. We are confident that your outstanding diplomatic qualities will ensure the full success of our work. I should also like to convey our gratitude to Mr. Joseph Garba for the competent manner in which he carried out his tasks at our last session. I should like also to pay a very sincere tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar  for his patient efforts  courage and perseverance in the service of peace  which is the principal objective of our Organisation. His sense of responsibility  his accessibility and his tireless will to work for the progress of mankind and for greater solidarity in the international community are qualities that deserve our gratitude.If the credibility of the actions of the various organs of the United Nations and the confidence of the international community have greatly increased during these last months  our task  none the less  remains immense. The reduction of tension between the super-Powers  the end of the confrontation of blocs and of the East-West antagonism had offered the hope that solutions would be found to the conflicts in the world. The collapse of the Berlin Hall  a symbol of the cold war  the rebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe and the beginning of multiparty systems in Africa had given us hope for a better future. Unfortunately  the onslaught of Iraq in the Gulf on 2 August has put a halt to the euphoria that existed in the international community. Today  there is indignation and we deeply grieve over Iraq's invasion of the State of Kuwait. The negation of the existence of a sovereign State  its occupation and the encroachment upon its territorial integrity are flagrant violations of international law. They are acts that run counter to the fundamental principles of the Charter of our Organization.Concerned for the preservation of peace in that part of the world  which has so often been the scene of fratricidal wars  the Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  at the Islamic Conference in Cairo  which occurred two days after the onslaught by the armed forces of Iraq  was one of the first Governments to condemn the invasion of Kuwait.Our country approves the courageous resolutions adopted unanimously by the Security Council. Only the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the recovery by Kuwait of its sovereignty and territorial integrity will open the way to a peaceful solution. It is for that reason that here  on behalf of the Government and people of the Comoros  in the name of the principles of Islam and brotherhood  I solemnly appeal to our Iraqi brothers to withdraw their forces from Kuwait and bring about the settlement of the conflict by peaceful means The stormy winds that are blowing at this time have  in any case  brought about the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and the final settlement of eight years of war between Iran and Iraq. For the first time in its history  the Security Council has managed to carry out its responsibility with the unanimous agreement of its five permanent members. That is an extremely encouraging event  one which greatly enhances the credibility of the United Nations. For small countries such as ours  which do not have armies capable of preventing aggression against us  the decisive measures adopted by the Security Council are more than merely reassuring. The Council  on behalf of the international community as a whole  has reacted clearly and unambiguously to as  unjustified act of aggression against a Member State. In this new context the delegation of the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros can only express the sincere hope that the cohesion and new spirit of co-operation shown by the five permanent members of the Security Council will continue. What would happen if all this was only temporary opportunism and not the expression of a well-thought-out and lasting will motivated solely by the desire for the maintenance of the peace and security of the entire international community? Let us hope that  on the contrary  our Organization and mankind as a whole are witnessing the emergence of a new era in which international law will definitively prevail over force.Does not this unanimity about the invasion of Kuwait give us  by the same token  new hope with regard to another conflict with which the Assembly has been regularly dealing for decades  namely  the Palestinian problem  the problem of another people expelled by force from its country? We Comorians are profoundly concerned by the persistence of the crisis in the Hear East. It too is the direct result of the brutality unjustly suffered by our Palestinian brothers. Our position on this question has never varied: we unreservedly support the struggle for the restoration of their inalienable right to self-determination  independence and freedom. The international community must no longer accept two sets of weights and measures: the suffering of the Palestinian people deserves our full attention  and the same just severity must be shown in regard to Israeli behaviour in the occupied territories. That is why we reaffirm our adherence to the convening in the near future of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestinian Liberation Organisation  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.Fortunately  despite these upheavals  solutions have been found to certain painful conflicts - Namibia provides proof of that. In this context  on behalf of the Government and people of the Comoros I welcome the Namibian delegation  which like that of Liechtenstein  is participating in the General Assembly for the first time as the representative of a full-fledged Member State.The liberation of Namibia marks the success of a people's struggle for its fundamental right to sovereignty. This victory is also a victory for the Organisation and is thus our own victory  and I should like to congratulate most particularly the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  on the efforts h  constantly exerted during that country's independence process. Today free Namibia is involved in a new struggle which is just as crucial - the struggle against underdevelopment and poverty. We hope that the international community will lend its support to Namibia in facing this challenge.Now  then  can we fail to welcome again here the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the lifting of the ban in South Africa on the liberation movements - measures that are the forerunners of the dismantling we all desire of the hateful and inhuman apartheid system. Since President De Klerk seems to be sincere in the efforts he is exerting to find a peaceful solution to a problem which for more than 40 years has aroused criticism and condemnation of his country  we must give him encouragement until apartheid is totally abolished and a multiracial South African society emerges.Still on the subject of Africa  how can one fail to hope for an end to the fratricidal struggles which have led to so much bloodshed and have spoiled so many lives? I am thinking here particularly of Liberia. Cambodia  on which negotiations have now reached a decisive stage  which we are happy to welcome certainly provides an example of the settlement of such conflicts.The Comoros Government is also following with interest the developments on the Korean question. We hope that the high-level contacts which have taken place recently between representatives of North Korea and of South Korea will be reflected in better mutual understanding and will create the necessary conditions for a peaceful settlement of that problem. In accordance with the principle of universality  which is one of the fundamental features of the United Nations  we support the aspiration of the Korean people to become a Member of the United Nations and thereby contribute to the strengthening of international peace  security and co-operation.A less violent but no less crucial problem has faced us Comorians for more than 15 years now: the question of Mayotte. We cannot fail to refer to the problem of this Comorian island  which indeed will be discussed very soon in the Assembly. For 15 years now we have been repeatedly and very objectively setting forth to the Assembly the facts on this territorial dispute which pits Comoros against France. Today  I wish to express again the determination of our President  Said Mohamed Djohar  and his coalition Government to spare no effort to bring about the reintegration of the island of Mayotte into its Comorian family. Firmly convinced of the justice of the claim to this part of our territory  the Government and the people of the Comoros are none the less open to all avenues that might lead to a peaceful settlement through the simple application of international law.Is it not unfortunate that the political detente between West and East has not yet given rise to economic détente between North and South? Indeed  international economic relations are still very unfair and impose on the weakest numerous burdens that are increasingly unbearable. The hope that the benefits expected from the growth of worst economic output would  through the trickle-down effect  benefit the poorer countries also  has not been realized. Given today's trends  one cannot rule out the possibility that the situation will continue to deteriorate. In such circumstances it is all the more urgent co establish increased international economic co-operation  based on the reality of the growing interdependence between national economies.It is very important that the developed countries and the poorer countries mobilize their efforts so as to be able  in a spirit of real solidarity  to find new solutions  not only to the problem of indebtedness  which ravages the economies of the third-world countries  but also to all other problems that hinder progress towards development. It is time to put an end to pious hopes and kind words and get down to action.As regards the resurgence of our economies  we should like to be certain that the specific measures adopted at the last special session of the General Assembly devoted to international co-operation  and those adopted at the second Paris Conference on the Least Developed Countries  really will be implemented so that we may be helped to break out of the vicious circle in which we now find ourselves because of the fluctuations in commodity prices  the constant deterioration of terms of trade  the strengthening of protectionism  the general contraction of the flow of financial resources to the poor countries  and the burden of debt repayment.The problem of indebtedness  which emerged in nearly all the poor countries in the early 1980e  has now spread  and it fuels a persistent crisis  which hinders expansion  disturbs social order and increasingly threatens the political stability of poor countries. Despite constant strong efforts at adjustment and rescheduling operations  the current international financial and monetary system makes it virtually impossible for the poor countries to deal with this burden. Of course  specific measures have recently been adopted by certain States and certain institutions to alleviate the debt of the least developed countries. In this connection  we express our profound gratitude to those States  particularly France  for the gesture of solidarity that has led to the writing off of Comorian debt. But is this enough to ensure that the objectives of justice  which all of us claim to pursue  will be attained? Is it enough to reverse the violence inflicted on the weakest by extreme poverty? Are nations not yet sufficiently convinced that  once again  those moat disinherited would be the first victims of today's crisis in the Gulf? What choice  what weapons  will be offered to us so that we may escape? We realise that the improvement of our national economy calls for a greater opening-up of our country  in spite of the aggravation of the international context after the emergence of new centres of interest to the rich countries in the Committee on Aid for Development. For now the development of South-South co-operation is becoming a pressing duty that we may ensure that the effects of development aid are reinforced. That is why we have chosen a policy of solidarity and regional integration as an effective tool of progress. Our entry  in 1986  into the Indian Ocean Commission demonstrated the importance that the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros attaches to the General Assembly's recommendations on the need for the poor island countries to co-operate on a regional basis in order to be better able to face their own problems. It is in that spirit that the Indian Ocean Commission has adopted a strategy that calls  as a matter of priority  for the strengthening of trade  industrial co-operation  and the improvement of transport and telecommunications. If that objective is to be achieved  the Indian Ocean Commission needs the help of international financial institutions. We therefore appeal to the international community as a whole to lend its active support to our young institution.On the home front  the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros has been tireless in its efforts since the election of President Said Mohammed Djohar last March. Ever since his investiture he has undertaken to work for a democratic  dynamic and open society and to struggle against corruption so that the economic and financial recovery of our country may be undertaken decisively. It is in that spirit that he entered into a dialogue with people of all political persuasions in the Comoros with a view to an amendment of our Constitution.One of the priorities in our development strategy is protection of the environment. As Comoros is a small and overpopulated country  our survival depends on protection and on policies designed to prevent soil erosion. We are therefore happy to note that  having for too many decades ignored all the warning signals  the industrialized countries have now begun to be seriously concerned about the environment. For that reason we support fully the proposal for convening the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992  in the hope that a concrete plan of action will be adopted. The Earth is our common heritage. All countries bear the responsibility of preserving and protecting our environment  and we should never lose sight of the fact that poverty and environmental degradation are indissolubly linked.These issues must be dealt with in conformity with the approach taken to the Gulf crisis; that is  any solution has its basis in solidarity by all parties  with complete respect for international law. There is no magic formula: a genuine and sincere commitment by the whole international community is needed more than ever before if the goal of peace  freedom and justice for all is to be achieved.The Comoros has confidence that our Organization is indeed capable of carrying out this noble task."
"34",1605,"CPV",45,1990,"﻿I should like to begin by offering Mr. de Marco my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I am convinced that his vast experience  skills and commitment will guide the work of this session to a fruitful conclusion.I commend his predecessor. Major General Joseph Garba  for his personal efforts and for the results achieved in the course of the forty-fourth session  over which he presided with efficiency and steadfastness. I also wish to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his dedication to the cause of international peace and security and for the skilful manner in which he has been assisting the diplomatic activities of the United Nations.As the universality of the Organisation is enlarged by the admission of new Members  we take great pride and satisfaction in seeing Namibia occupy its place as a full Member of this assembly of independent nations. We congratulate the people of Namibia for having attained its freedom from the yoke of colonial occupation after many years of struggle and perseverance. We wish the people of Namibia the best in its effort to build a nation with dignity and to create spiritual and material well-being for itself.We also welcome Liechtenstein's admission into the membership of the United Nations and pledge it the co-operation of my Government and delegation.Over the past few months  we have witnessed a happy trend towards the reunification of nations. In that regard  I welcome with great satisfaction the reunification of Germany  a nation with which my country. Cape Verde  has always entertained the best relations. At a time when Germany  after four decades  has recovered its full national sovereignty and put an end to one of the most painful sequel to the Second World War  I wish the German people happiness  peace and prosperity in its reunited country.I take this opportunity also to offer the Yemeni people my congratulations on the unification of its country and to wish it a future of peace and happiness. We hope soon to be able to welcome the unification of the Korean nation. In that context  encouragement should be given to the continuation of high-level contacts in the search for a peaceful solution to the Korean conflict.We live today in a world of great changes and expectations. In Caps Verde  we have been following those changes with a great deal of interest for their repercussions on world peace and their impact upon the political  economic and social well-being of all nations.The political events that have taken place over the last few years in Eastern Europe have generated a climate conducive to pence and co-operation among European nations and between the Soviet Union and the United States of America  thus putting an end to the cold war that polarised world politics for many decades. The democratisation of the Eastern Europe countries and the reunification of Germany are events of paramount importance in the history of this century and represent the triumph of reason  a democratic and united Europe is a powerful factor for world peace and stability  economic development and the well-being of the peoples of the region. At this juncture  I sincerely wish the best to all the peoples of Europe  and that they unite their faith and garner their strength in redesigning their collective way of co-existing in peace. And I hope that  in a fraternal and democratic way  solutions will be found to the problems that separated them in the past and contributed to the economic failures of many.I encourage the leaders of that region and their peoples to continue to build the peaceful relations necessary to foment the harmony and economic development of all countries in the region. I am convinced that the new Europe will contribute towards the political stability and economic development of other regions  and particularly to the region of Africa to which we belong.The fundamental changes in the policy of the Soviet Union that have taken place over the past few years set in motion a process that seems to have contributed to the end of the cold war  thus ushering in a new chapter in the relationship between the super-Powers  based this time on co-operation  the upholding of the right of peoples to self-determination  and the creation of a better climate of world peace and security. Those changes augur well for the emergence of a new era in the history of nations  an era dominated not by the fear of a nuclear catastrophe  but characterised by co-operation among all countries  democratisation and economic development and respect for and maintenance of international law.The democratisation of the world seems to be a fundamental political feature of the new era. At the international level  that democratisation  is based on respect for the sovereignty and integrity of all nations  the non-use of force in international relations  and co-operation among nations in the establishment of conditions of peace  prosperity and the political stability of all countries.There is also democratisation at the national level  for we believe that the economic and social development of countries is a goal that goes hand in hand with the establishment of a system of real democracy that liberates the creativity of peoples  eliminates the political obstacles to private initiative  and creates stable conditions conducive to investment.In Cape Verde  legal mechanisms have been set up and political reforms introduced to put in place a democratic parliamentary system of Government. We are convinced that the reforms that have been introduced into our political life will undoubtedly strengthen our internal stability and reinforce the efforts and the commitments of the Cape Verdean people living at home and abroad to build a modern and developed nation  at peace with itself and with the world.We also believe that the democratisation of nations will strengthen the checks-and-balances mechanisms of different governmental organs.These checks and balances seem to gain more relevance in a world in which actions are being taken by some statesmen with total disregard for the basic norms of international law. Such actions could endanger world peace and stability and create economic hardship  especially for the economically vulnerable third-world countries.The climate of peace and dialogue that we have been witnessing lately has suffered a great blow with the current situation in the Gulf. Cape Verde condemns most firmly the invasion of Kuwait and its purported annexation by Iraq. In due time the Security Council  voicing the feelings of frustration and indignation of the international community unequivocally condemned the invasion of Kuwait and took measures aimed at ending such an occupation. Cape Verde supports those measures unconditionally and supports the community of nations to take appropriate steps to restore the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait.The prompt and unequivocal stand of the Security Council  which I commend  has broadened the prospects of United Nations activities in the maintenance of international peace and security  as a guarantor of the peace of all nations  especially of countries that are small or militarily weak. On the other hand  it is high time the Security Council and the United Nations in general sought to resolve  once and for all  the conflict in the Middle East. The Security Council resolutions related to the region in general  and to the Palestinian conflict in particular  should be implemented with the same vigour and forcefulness. Major Charter principles must not be implemented selectively. They should be scrupulously observed and actively supported by all nations. If we went a credible United Nations and a reliable Security Council  then we  as nations  must act with seriousness of purpose  consistent with the Charter.Regrettably  to the present day fundamental Charter principles have been violated time and again. We have seen the sovereignty of countries repeatedly violated in Angola  Mozambique and elsewhere; we have seen illegal occupation and annexation of territories in the Middle East. We have witnessed the flouting of the right of self-determination and independence in East Timor  the plight of the Timorese people  whose right to choose their destiny has fallen into oblivion and whose lives have been torn apart.Yet those blatant and consistent patterns of disregard for the Charter's principles have not met with strong and vigorous condemnation and action by the United Nations.Turning a blind eye to those principles or violating them whenever it suits the whims and interests of narrow foreign policy objectives means sending mixed signals as to the determination of the United Nations and the Security Council to defend them and impose complete compliance with them. I hope that the actions taken by the Security Council against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait represents a turning-point in the role of the Council and the United Nations and that they will live up to their responsibilities by consistently defending those principles and guaranteeing international peace and security.Cape Verde is very sensitive to the problems of the environment. In this regard  it is very encouraging to note the enormous interest that countries all over the world have been showing in the protection and preservation of the environment.At a time when there is concrete evidence of the continuous deterioration of environmental conditions on the planet  affecting the whole of mankind  the community of nations should seize the opportunity offered by the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development to take effective action to improve the quality of the air that we all breathe and protect the ozone layer and the world's climate.The struggle against drought and desertification  which is spreading every year  is a pressing need that deserves the attention and serious effort not only of those immediately affected  but of all nations.The time has come to undertake  at a world-wide level  new initiatives to counter-attack effectively the devastating ecological effects of drought and desertification.Solving the global problems that we all face today - the democratisation of political institutions; the ensuring of world peace and security; world-wide human rights protection and protection of the children  in respect of whom the successful first World Summit recently took place in New York - requires and presupposes a substantial improvement in the living conditions of peoples in the developing countries. The shaping of a new international relations that we all seem to visualize and that we all want  must be based on  or accompanied by the development of all countries.UNLESS the world's economic and social problems are addressed  the impact of the relaxation of international tensions and conflicts will be Minimal; human rights abuses will continue to be perpetrated; the democratization of the world will for many be an unattainable goal; and the protection of the world's environment will be seriously threatened.It is in the process of economic and social development  or as a consequence of it  that peoples learn to appreciate  cherish and respect the democratic values of society; it is in this process that peoples learn that arbitrary imprisonment  indiscriminate killings by death squads and other outrageous human rights violations belong to a world of tyranny and political backwardness that should no longer be tolerated; it is in this process that peoples learn how to love nature and preserve the environment.The globalisation of issues and the need for harmonious and peaceful coexistence among countries require  today more than ever  a serious  consistent and general response to the challenges posed by underdevelopment. At a time when we are witnessing with great satisfaction the unfolding of positive political events in the international arena and are preparing to forge a new era in international relations  it becomes imperative that a new agenda be drawn up to consider  and find collective answers to  global issues. Africa  step by step  is creating the conditions for  and is positioning itself as an active partner in  the emergence and definition of this new era.The independence of Namibia and the prospects for a negotiated settlement of the conflict against apartheid in South Africa are important factors in the process of the restoration of Africa's freedom from colonialism and racism. In this context I encourage the ongoing contacts and efforts in South Africa with a view to eliminating apartheid and creating a non-racial  democratic and harmonious society.We are very concerned over the economic  and social situation in Africa  a region with the highest number of least developed countries. This concern of ours is heightened by the poor results achieved at the second Conference of the Least Developed Countries.We believe that the ongoing political reforms in Africa will greatly improve internal conditions for economic development in the continent. These courageous efforts by African countries should be supported with massive economic and financial assistance on the part of the developed countries that will help them consolidate their newly created democratic institutions.We hope that the enthusiasm born of the political events in Europe and the subsequent emergence of new geographical areas of economic interest will not divert the attention of our partners of the developed world.As the twentieth century draws to an end  it is our sincere hope that the next century will be a century of global democratisation and economic development  harmony and well-being of all peoples of the world. It is therefore incumbent upon us all to have a vision of the future and to take the necessary steps towards that and  thus creating a new society  a society of peoples of different cultures  but united by the same nature and destiny in a world without frontiers."
"35",1650,"CRI",45,1990,"I wish first of all to convey to Mr. Guido de Marco the sincere congratulations of the government and the people of Costa Rica on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. For Costa Rica – a country which is small like Malta and democratic like Malta – it is deeply satisfying to see a son of the land of Mizzi guiding the work of the Assembly at its forty-fifth session. We are sure his election to the presidency will contribute a decisive contribution to the success of the Assembly’s work.The breadth of experience of the Secretary-General  his total commitment to the cause of peace and his tireless dedication to his work have exalted the office of Secretary-General and have earned the gratitude of the entire world. Under the leadership of Javier Peres de Cuellar  the United Nations has resumed its place in the search for harmony. It has resumed its role as the focal point of international relations and the repository of collective efforts towards peace and co-operation between nations. It is an honour for Costa Rica to join the groundswell of international public opinion in conveying its respectful tribute and sincere thanks to a man who has given the Organization its brightest days.  Costa Rica take great pleasure in welcoming the admission of Namibia as a new Member of the United Nations. Despite the geographic distance  my country for many years supported the legitimate right of the Namibian people to self-determination. In 1983 it was our privilege to act as host to the first regional seminar organized by the United Nations on the question of Namibia. We are sincerely happy that the Namibian independence process has come to a peaceful and eminently democratic conclusion  and that today the representative of that people has joined us in this forum. My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to express its profound pleasure at the admission of a new Member State  the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations. Cost Rica consider that Liechtenstein’s democratic system and dedication to peace and development co-operation are firm guarantees that Liechtenstein will make a valuable contribution to the activities of this world Organization. Cost Rica believes that in order to achieve its goals the United Nations should include all sovereign States. The principle of universality  in keeping with the Organization’s practice  implies that all the world’s people have the right to be represented here. In this respect  my country wishes to express yet again its conviction that an affirmative response should be given to the aspiration of the Republic of Korea to join the United Nations and that this response should not be conditional on the vicissitudes of inter-Korean affairs  but should rather be viewed in the light of the Charter alone. We have observed with great pleasure the exemplary efforts that have resulted in unification of the Yemen seat  and which will shortly have an analogous result in the case of German representation. While the much-desired reunification of Korea has not taken place  Costa Rica believes that the legitimate desire of the Republic of Korea to join in the efforts of this Organization cannot be ignored.My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to offer its cordial congratulations to the many Member States which  in the year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly  have seen the seeds of democracy take root. There is no doubt that this phenomenon  which is daily more widespread  increases the moral authority of this Organization and the respect which its goals and principles should inspire in all of us.It is certainly true that within a very short period of time the world has been transformed. International law has come to be seen as the right instrument for solving disputes. A wind of optimism has blown through the most disparate places on the planet. With a speed disconcerting even to the most astute observers  conflicts have dissipated  dialogue has flourished and confrontation has given way to co-operation. For the first time in its long history  the world has started to become a real community of united nations. None the less  this new tack mankind has taken towards common sense is at this very moment facing a serious  unforeseeable and unjustifiable obstacle. The Persian Gulf crisis is endangering world peace and undermining the fundamental values of this Organization. With flagrant disregard for the most elementary principles of the rights of peoples  a State Member of the United Nations has been invaded by another. Its authorities have been deposed  and to cap it all it has been unceremoniously annexed. The Iraqi aggression against Kuwait has earned universal condemnation  and the United Nations has faithfully lived up to its commitment by demanding that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait be respected and by implementing specific measures to ensure that this occurs. Unhappily  the Government of Iraq has to date refused to heed the voice of the international community  and even the resolutions of the Security Council  world peace hangs by a thread while billion-dollar losses are occurring in the economies of the various countries of the world  the lives of innocent people are in peril and all nations  particularly under-developed countries  are beginning to feel the tragic effects of a new energy crisis. Costa Rica  which has entrusted its security to international law  reiterates its strong condemnation of the aggression perpetrated against Kuwait and firmly supports the decisions taken by the United Nations aimed at preserving peace and guaranteeing the effectiveness of the principles of the Charter. We cannot in exchange for peace permit the illegal to be tolerated as if it were legal. However  we must also  through strict compliance with Security Council resolutions  prevent this century of countless victims from concluding with a third blood-bath  and instead leave the new millennium a legacy of harmony and fraternity. There can be no doubt that the Central American process should form a part of this trend towards peace which is now prevalent in the world  and which it is now more urgent than ever to pursue  preserve and strengthen. The Central American crisis  which for more than a decade was the subject of innumerable press headlines and the reason for countless diplomatic initiatives  took its final course towards resolution with the implementation of the Esquipulas process  the last link in a long chain of efforts which began in 1982 and culminated in 1987  thanks to the Cost Rican initiative and with the consensus of the other Central American Governments. Today  all the countries in the region have democratically elected Governments  and the state of hostilities which afflicted Nicaragua has been ended. It is true that the internal conflict in El Salvador continues  but with the active support of the United Nations a process of dialogue is taking place which we trust will culminate in a solid peace for El Salvador and the reconciliation of all its people within a framework of liberty and democracy. Costa Rica also believes that as long as those negotiations continue  it is vitally important that there should be unilateral cease-fire declarations  both by the Government of El Salvador and by the FMLN  accompanied by immediate implementation of the agreement on human rights recently signed by the parties in San Jose  Costa Rica  and of the reforms in electoral law agreed by the political parties of El Salvador and the FMLN. This would be evidence of a sincere interest in reaching a definitive solution and would put an stop to the tragedy the Salvadorian people are experiencing. The Government of Costa Rica trusts also that on 7 November the Security Council will renew the mandate of the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ONUCA) so that it can continue its work in Central America and thus ensure proper verification for aggression against other States and to end assistance to the irregular forces.After many years of hostilities  unrest and mistrust  the five countries of Central America are today experiencing a fruitful experiment in understanding and co-operation. None the less  the isthmus is emerging from the political crisis in deplorable economic and social conditions. The growth indices are feeble  there is a high trade deficit and standards of nutrition  health and education are worrying. Naturally  all these factors make the progress achieved in democratization and respect for human rights extremely fragile.  We have worked hard to enable Central America to live in peace and freedom  but this effort will bear no fruit if it is not accompanied by prospects of development and social justice. In this respect  Costa Rica considers that support from the international community for the Plan of Economic Co-Operation for Central America should have high priority. We are extremely concerned that lest diminishing tensions in Central America should entail – as has already happened in some aspects – a lack of interests in our problems and a reduction in co-operation for development in the area. Without international solidarity  the Central American nations will be unable to recover even to the levels of development they had before the crisis. Without development  the democratic will and the desire for a lasting peace of Central America are at risk. As is the case in Central America  tensions in other parts of the world have eased  and there are now only vestiges of what only a short time ago used to be called the East-West confrontation. Perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union and the wave of freedom which has swept away authoritarianism in Eastern Europe have brought about a genuine and complex transformation in international relations. The balance of terror has been displaced by a marked desire for concertation. The super-Powers have initiated effective policies of join action  which are particularly important in terms of guaranteeing international peace and security. However  even if East-West tensions already seem destined to be become mere history  North-South differences  in contrast  remain and are becoming more acute. The technological gulf is becoming an abyss  and there have been no major changes in the international economic order consequent on the changes in the international political scene. Furthermore  in the North-South forums for dialogue  there has been no radical change  no substantive change in attitude in favour of the underdeveloped world.There is no doubt that political changes have been highly positive  but what concrete value can the third world attribute to the new dimensions of the international horizon? What effective relevance can the flourishing of democracy and freedom have for the impoverished societies if the underdeveloped nations if their prospects for development do not improve? As His Holiness Pope John Paul II pointed out during his recent trip  Africa  the cradle of mankind  is suffering mercilessly from the tragedy of poverty and hunger. For its part Latin America  the emporium of foreign wealth  is seeing its reborn democracies immersed in discouragement while they are savagely lashed by terrorism and drug trafficking. The prices of its products are falling  its capital is being drained and its natural resources are being sadly destroyed. Costa Rica does not argue that the solution to the critical social and economic conditions prevailing in the third world should be the exclusive responsibility of the developed nations. We know that in order to overcome poverty we must work with discipline. We know that there are no magic formulas for achieving development. We know that foreign aid will always be inadequate if it is not complemented by a rational and productive distribution of its components and a huge dose of effort and responsibility at the very core of our nations. However  we also consider that at the same time a different attitude should prevail in the developed world  a true willingness to improve the terms of trade  to contribute towards raising levels of understanding in the economic and financial sphere. Costa Rica believes that the initiative of the Americas recently formulated by the President of the United States of America is directed to that and represents a true effort to achieve co-operation in North-South relations. The situation in the third world will not substantially improve without progress in the solution of the problem of foreign debt  which should also be dealt with in unison. My country does not seek to have its debt cancelled  nor do we believe that debt is the sole cause of our difficulties. We do  however  indeed believe that  taking into consideration the ability of the debtors  it is time that  together  broad and specific answers be found to this problem  the effects of which severely handicap the possibility of improving the quality of life in underdeveloped countries.  Costa Rica further considers it fundamental that in numerous aspects the implementation of measures proposed by international financial institutions for dealing with the problems faced by third world countries in meeting their obligations carries with it a very high social price tag. Little progress can be made with such policies if the only thing to emerge from them are the elements of new crimes  more poverty  more unemployment  less production  less education  less health and less housing. My country fervently urges the Governments of the developed countries whose voices are decisive in international financial organizations to bring their influence to bear on this problem and to bring about a change in attitude within these organizations. The international financial community can no longer ignore the aspect of the social cost if it truly wants readjustment policies to be successful. Technical criteria cannot qualify as such if they fail to take into account the social and human factors involved. Similarly  the policy of co-operation with the third world implemented by the majority of the developed countries would be meaningless if those same nations were at the same time to encourage international financial organizations to adopt an indifferent stance vis-à-vis the social costs to the third world of implementing the proposal emerging from such institutions. We emphasize that we are not seeking to elude our responsibilities but  rather the find  together  the formula least detrimental to all of us.The same approach of joint responsibility should be taken with regard to the challenge of drug trafficking. For those who have personally suffered under that appalling scourge  the priority must not be to seek out the guilty but  rather  to find solutions  and we must find those solutions together  for we are all current or potential victims of the scourge. The tragedy that today afflicts the brave people of Colombia  a heroic defender of democracy that drug traffickers are trying to undermine  will tomorrow become the tragedy of the people of Costa Rica or  indeed  of any of the nations represented here unless effective measures are taken to exterminate those sinister and shadowy twentieth-century freebooters at the very root. The spirit of conciliation should likewise be the basis for all world efforts in favour of peace. Costa Rica assigns a leading role to peace in the life of everyone. For the Costa Rican people this highest of virtues is solidly founded on the fruitful basis of democracy. It is the focal point of our national life and the basic element in our foreign policy. It was in the belief that education for peace represents one of the principal instruments for guaranteeing the future of our species that we proposed the creation of the University of Peace  based in Costa Rica  which is now celebrating its tenth anniversary and to whose charter  approved by the General Assembly  we urge all Member States to adhere. International public opinion has repeatedly raised the questions of peace dividends  which Costa Rica views as a matter of high priority. With the easing of East-West tensions numerous items in the military budgets of the super-Powers are  fortunately  now destined to dwindle or disappear. Disarmament  which at times appeared to be an empty concept or a romantic illusion  is now taking on vibrant momentum and should become firmly entrenched in its rightful place. Over a period of many years Costa Rica has been the beneficiary of substantial peace dividends. It has never possessed nuclear or chemical weapons nor does it ever wish to do so. It does not have an army  nor does it wish to have an army. We are an underdeveloped country with a high level of debt  but the resources we have available are invested in health  education  housing and development  not in tanks or fighter planes. As we have said on numerous occasions  we respect the right of other nations to possess armed forces  but we consider it unjustifiable that such forces should consume all their existing assets  even those they do not actually possess  while a large proportion of the world’s population remains in poverty. Costa Rica considers it to be indispensable that nuclear testing cease and that all weapons designed for mass destruction be eliminated. We would also urge all Member States to support efforts under way within the framework of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament with respect to the prohibitions of the development  production  acquisition and use of chemical weapons. However  Costa Rica also believes that disarmament negotiations should also address the matter of conventional weapons  whose destructive potential and cost to have significantly increased in recent years. In that respect my delegation wishes to stress the significance of the round of negotiations currently being held by the five Central American countries on matters of security and of the control and limitation of armaments  with the  valuable assistance of the United Nations. We believe that regional disarmament negotiations  which should include  in any event  the elaboration of reliable verification mechanisms  can constitute an appropriate means of reducing the stockpiling of arms and the size of armed forces. In the case of third world countries that would unquestionably make available substantial resources that could be used for economic and social development. However  it is also necessary for the developed world to co-operate in achieving those objectives  through special programmes of co-operation for those disarmament and reduced military spending. In the opinion of Costa Rica  if a portion of the peace dividend should be devoted to co-operation with the third world  preferential treatment should be given to those underdeveloped countries that are making progress in the sphere of disarmament and reduced military spending. We consider that it is not only fair but appropriate that these processes be encouraged by special co-operation incentives. It is alarming to see that countries with low levels of economic and social development spend up to one quarter of their national budget on military hardware and yet  when it comes to co-operation  they receive the same treatment as nations with extremely low military budgets. If the Governments of developed countries with to close the breach with the third world  it is time they decided – by means of a formal treaty  which could be drawn up within the Organization – to orient co-operation principally towards those countries effectively on the road to arms reductions. Costa Rica believes it to be unfair that when assigning assistance  identical reasoning is applied to those investing their funds in weaponry. Furthermore  my countries feels that the developed world should similarly actively promote a policy designed to eradicate or reduce as much as possible that sale of weapons to the third world  particularly to the poorest nations or those most afflicted by violence. Today  disarmament is not only a moral imperative but has become an indispensable condition to guarantee the survival of mankind. By implementing effective disarmament processes  not only will we make available immense economic and human resources for food  health  education and social welfare  but a contribution will be made towards world peace. The international adventurism and threats to peace and world security from which the world has suffered on so many occasions can only be stopped if arms stockpiling is stopped.The Organization has dedicated the last decade of the century to international law. In the opinion of Costa Rica  the best method to guarantee the supremacy of that law is to eliminate the means to break it. Only to the extent that substantial progress is made in the disarmament process  rational limits are imposed on the manufacture and sale of weapons and the illicit sale of arms is effectively impeded  will the rule of international legal standards be strengthened. That will at the same time consolidate the central role to be played by the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of disputes.However  international law not only regulates the conduct of nations among themselves. International law has focused a considerable portion of its content on the protection of the inherent rights of man. Consequently the decade of international law also involves a decade dedicated to human rights.It is gratifying to all of us to be able to recognize that the democratic upsurge that has been taking place in the world has translated into a greater respect for human rights  particularly with respect to civil and political rights. We believe that conditions are favourable for international human-rights protection agencies to intensify their activities and broaden their spheres of action. In that respect  Costa Rica strongly urges those Member States that have not done so to join the international human rights agreements and take the steps required to guarantee full compliance with them. Furthermore  it is necessary that people become familiar with the rights and realise that they are not gracious concessions granted by Governments. A daily experience of respect for human rights is the best method of guaranteeing harmony within a State and the growth in that State of vigorous and indestructible roots of democracy.Nevertheless  the panorama with respect to human rights in certain cases continues to be of concern. We are deeply concerned over human rights situations in Liberia. In South Africa  despite the evolving process  the truth is that the apartheid system continues to impose absurd and odious discrimination. Costa Rica  which several years ago broke off all relations with the Pretoria regime  reiterates its repugnance for any form of racial discrimination and urges all the South African authorities to take steps in the near future for the immediate elimination of apartheid. My country is also concerned over the disregard for the human rights of the Palestinians and the incessant violence reigning in Lebanon. No matter how complex the Middle East problem may be  no matter how difficult it may be to balance the elements  we believe that any formula for a solution requires the implementation by all parties involved of an effective policy of respect for human rights  particularly civil and political rights. With respect to human rights  the Government of Costa Rica is deeply concerned over a situation that exists on a world scale. The right to life  granted by the principal international human rights instruments  inevitably includes the right to live in a habitable world. However  the activities of mankind are daily making the exercise of that right an ever-increasingly illusion. If the threat of a nuclear holocaust causes concern  the threat of a planetary ecological catastrophe is much more tangible and imminent. In the most irresponsible manner  humanity is dedicated to destroying its environment and severely compromising its very existence as a species. As is true with actions affecting international peace and security  those endangering ecological security in any part of the world are of concern to all of us. If the international law of our times recognizes more strongly every day that respect for human rights cannot be considered a matter of the exclusive internal competence of each State  that should be particularly emphasized when we refer to environmental rights.Costa Rica believes that the time has come to direct our energies towards a new international ecological order. There are almost 150 international agreements on the matter  but very few are directed towards the prevention of environmental destruction processes. There are huge gaps also with respect to definitions  verification and many other related matters.The idea of a new international ecological order is the product of our conviction that we are no longer in a position to accept isolated efforts. It is necessary to unite and to develop international standards on all fronts in that field. We must  as soon as possible  design and implement more effective multilateral strategies to preserve our environment. In that respect  Costa Rica believes that the United Nations should give priority attention to environmental matters. We may observe with great interest the proposal made by the Soviet Union to organize a world environmental monitoring and control system  which would include on-side verification mechanisms. We consider that  after a careful inventory is taken of ecological problems  such a system would open the door to intense activity aimed at saving our resources. We are also of the opinion that an international environmental monitoring and control system should work on the basis of specific time limits for nations to implement the resolutions formulated in the ecological field  and sanctions against those nations which persist in non-compliance. We repeat that threats to ecological security should be regarded as one more aspect of threats to international security. In that regard  we believe that sanctions that may be agreed upon by the Security Council should be imposed in those cases in which ecological security is endangered. We also feel that Member States should report periodically to the United Nations regarding the measures they have taken to preserve the environment  to promote international co-operation in that field and  in particular  to encourage environmental education at all levels. As is true with peace and human rights  for man to value his environment he must be taught from infancy that he has important duties and responsibilities to himself  to his fellow man and to future generations in that respect. Costa Rica attributes significant importance to the Conference on the Environment and Development scheduled for 1992. Nevertheless  we believe that as of now concrete measures can be implemented to foster the solution of world and regional ecological problems  based on shared responsibilities. Not for nothing did the Declaration of Stockholm state in 1972 that in under-developed countries the majority of environmental problems are caused by under-development itself. The possibilities of using resources diverted from military budgets towards their solution should be another of the dividends brought about by peace. We should not wait until 1992 to expound universally valid responses to those anguishing problems. In 1992 the process of the new Europe will also reach its culmination. For many decades the European Community has been constructing one of the most prosperous societies in history  within a framework of democracy and freedom. The reunification of Germany  vastly accelerated since the fall of the wall of shame  will doubtless contribute  starting next week  to an unprecedented boost to the process of the European Community. Likewise in 1992 will occur the fifth centenary of the day on which the destinies of America and Europe crossed to give a complete perspective of the world. The proximity of this anniversary should induce us to reformulate the bonds which join not only America and Europe but also the developed world and the underdeveloped nations.We all form the crew of a single ship. We must be committed to unity. We shall have made no progress at all if ideological blocs disappear only to be replaced by economic blocs. International peace and security should be seen not only in military terms. A firm peace should be a fertile global peace  one in which we all co-operate and reciprocate with respect to progress and development. The Assembly is meeting at a crucial time in the history of mankind. The world is at a crossroads. If we are here it is because we have faith in the fact that the international community will be capable of continuing on the road of reason. Costa Rica  a peace-loving country and a country that practices peace  a country that shares the values sustaining this Organization  today wishes to reiterate its firm belief that the United Nations will be able to bring to fruition  for our times and for future generations  the ideal of a peace based on law.In 1979 Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier  then Minister of Foreign Affairs and today President of Costa Rica  stated in this very forum concepts which are today more valid than ever and which my delegation wishes to see shared by all nations represented here:“The United Nations will survive in so far as its nations mirror the trust of the world’s peoples and their home for a more just society.“To keep faith without faltering is a task incumbent upon us all  especially upon those of us who believe that this is the last hope the Almighty has granted us to find peace and ensure the survival of the human race.”"
"36",1696,"CSK",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you on your election. Your professional skills and your kindness  which I had the opportunity to know during my recent visit to your country  will be much needed in guiding the present session of the General Assembly.The past year was to a substantial extent a year of Europe. The eastern half of Europe is regaining its freedom and sovereignty.Your presidency appears to me to be a symbol. You are taking office as a representative of a European country which is  however  also fairly close to Africa and whose port of Valletta was for centuries a place of clashes as well as a refuge that was always available on the routes between Europe and Asia  the West and the East  as was said in Rudyard Kipling's time  or the North and the South  as we are beginning to say nowadays.The most recent sessions of the General Assembly have already indicated that the United Nations is only now returning to the opportunities of the time of its founding. The success of last year's session was due to your predecessor General Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria  who deserves our gratitude.It has become customary to address here all the particular areas of United Nations activities. I shall certainly comment on some of them today  and we will express our views on others later. Yet I feel a need to be a little bit personal  which will take a little time.It is a special honour for me to be welcomed into the community of nations as the first Foreign Minister of newly liberated Czechoslovakia. Twenty-two years ago I was sitting in this Hall in the press gallery and listening to a statement by the then Soviet Foreign Minister  Andrei Gromyko. He was putting forward arguments to back up a definition of aggression. It was a fine definition. However  I felt a shiver running down my spine. Gromyko was speaking as if he did not know that he was defining  describing and condemning precisely what his own country had perpetrated against Czechoslovakia no more than six weeks earlier. Then  for many years  I followed from the places where I had to live and work because of that aggression - among others from a prison - the difficulties and sometimes even political paralysis of this Organisation  the cascades of rhetoric and mutual accusations. It was not until the past few years that  among other things because of the more favourable developments in the eastern part of Europe  certain results emerged. To a considerable extent we owe it to the tireless activities of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  that the United Nations has  after all  played a meaningful role - for example in Namibia's accession to independence and in the assertion of minimum human-rights standards.I have said that the past year was a year of Europe - a year of historical failure of its totalitarian regimes. My country  too  is now  after 50 years  rededicating itself to its democratic traditions. We are all still somewhat surprised. No more than a year ago I was living in a country mired in immorality  economic decline and police persecution; now I am living in a country full of hope that has already had free elections and is taking the first steps towards introducing a market economy  a year ago I was working as a boiler-room attendant  publishing an independent underground newspaper and being chased by the secret police  while today I am addressing you as the Foreign Minister of my country.In the heart of Europe  at the crossroads of European history  we have often been compelled to think about our place within the community of nations. Armies used to roll over our territory  and a number of European wars started and ended there. More than once  forces stronger than ourselves forced us to give way to their interests. When we were not willing to do so - as at the time of Munich or the Prague Spring - they sent troops to make us obey. Nevertheless  we have always succeeded in recovering.The first Czechoslovak President  Tomas Garrigue Masaryk  believed that greatness was not a matter of size or numbers of population but rather a matter of inner strength  truth  culture and education  of the contribution a person or a nation can make to enrich the common treasury of humanity  of the values he or she will create and offer to others. Standing on the threshold of our new democracy  we want to meet this challenge.The rapid disintegration of the totalitarian structures in Central and Eastern Europe wan the fruit of the activities of people yearning to live in freedom in a just  democratic and prosperous society. However  it was also a proof of the fact that systems incapable of reflection and self-renewal at ever higher levels are doomed to passivity  rigidity and ultimately to extinction. Many dictators have terrorised peoples in this century; there were Stalin  Hitler  Mussolini  there were numbers of others in Asia  Africa and Latin America. In the end  they always led their countries to failure and defeat. Undoubtedly  those continuing along similar lines today will end up in the same way. That  however  always costs a lot of suffering  misery and human lives.We also know from our experience that those who cause suffering always seek to justify their actions by invoking lofty ideals: the only true faith; the interest of the nation; the struggle for the best of worlds. Then  m aggression is not an aggression but a holy war or a liberation struggle; killing is not murder but the defeat of enemies of freedom or of criminal elements. In the United Nations  too  we were encountering that approach for over four decades. I am happy to note that  by taking an unambiguous stand on the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait  our Organisation is coming back - definitively  I hope - to its real mission. Only with the end of confrontation and with the East and the Nest engaging in genuine co-operation will the United Nations be able to exert more effective efforts in promoting global security and human rights  eradicating famine and underdevelopment  protecting and improving the environment  combating drug abuse and terrorism and building up mechanisms of economic development and co-operation for the whole world community.If we are to succeed  we need a peaceful  favourable international environment where nobody suffers too much and where everybody has a chance. Naturally  there are differing priorities as to courses of development. The wealthier part of the world is in a process of economic integration. Europe at present is seeking ways towards integration not only in the economic sphere but also in the political and social spheres  and perhaps in defence as well. Most countries of the South have other priorities  the need to cope with hunger  population explosion  debt  falling prices of their traditional products and raw materials  lack of investments  an inadequate infrastructure  insufficient levels of know-how and a lack of access to modern technologies.We know well from our own experience what it means to have a malfunctioning economy which creates a system of ever-present shortages and what consequences that entails for the life of the society in economic and moral terms. This is also the reason why we do not want to see confirmed the anxieties that a part of development assistance  already insufficient  might be drawn off because of the needs of Central and Eastern Europe.In the past  development assistance was shrouded in numerous illusions  many of them voiced also in our Organisation. But even in the form it took and the extent to which it was provided  such assistance has resulted in a lot of good. Yet  fundamental issues have remained unresolved. At times development aid was turned into an instrument of ideological rivalry in third world countries  with the East-West conflict looming in the background. At present  nothing could be worse than the replacement of the disappearing cold war bipolarity by a new North-South bipolarity.One hundred years ago  Radyard Kipling said: ""East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet"". For the author of the Jungle Book  admirer of Asia  Africa and the golden schools of fish at Mandalay  the difference in civilisations between his England end his India seemed impossible to overcome. From the mechanical viewpoint of that century  he could not foresee the age of computers. From the period of colonial empires and clearly geographically defined interests  he could not envision our global civilisation  where we can already determine common principles leading to the success or failure of our activities. Now  even a minor issue can become a global one - a conflict of religions or nationalities in the Middle East also makes itself felt through murders at an airport in Some or the Olympics in Munich.We Czechs and Slovaks highly value our own national identity. Throughout our history  we had to struggle to preserve it. That is perhaps one of the reasons why we know that the identity of peoples cannot be confused with the political intentions of those who seek to stay in power or to gain power by fomenting fanaticism  be it of a nationalist  religious or ideological nature.Thus  we do not consider Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait to be just a regional matter confined  let us say  to the Middle East. We perceive it to be an attack on the fundamental rules of coexistence among nations and States. These rules are also enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Once we have succeeded in reaching the point where we are beginning to speak the same language  we should not let this opportunity of the world community slip out of our bands. Those who do not understand this or who do not want to understand this  those who would attempt to make use of the current situation to settle some problem of their own  jeopardise not only that opportunity and the international community  but also  ultimately  themselves.This is certainly an emotional moment for me  personally  but I deem it much more important that my country has ended the long nightmare that befell a large part of the world and that was also impeding the activities of the United Nations. Although we had to exert efforts of our own to make the revolutionary change happen  we would not have been successful without the support and assistance of all democratic and freedom-loving countries and forces of the world community. These included the seven courageous Russians who demonstrated at Red Square against the occupation of Czechoslovakia in August 1966  the Polish Solidarity movement  members of the Congress of the United States and members of both Western European and American human rights movements  writers and politicians  people like Francois Mitterrand  Olof Palme and Andrei Sakharov  all of whom have supported us through personal contacts. I am naming but a few of those who have always known that the struggle for human rights  freedom and democracy is universal  that if we allow injustice to exist elsewhere  it can appear on our doorstep as wall. They have also included those Soviet politicians who  like Mikhail Gorbachev or Eduard Shevardnadze were not afraid to open a window to the world and set in motion the democratisation of their own society.Czechoslovak foreign policy is now independent and ready to bear its share of responsibility for the future of the international community.First of all  we had to normalize our relations with our neighbours. We wish to participate in the economic integration of Europe and to contribute in an active manner towards creating common human rights standards and a common European economic  legal  environmental  cultural and security structure. We wish to become a full member of the Council of Europe. We want to make a contribution to the institutionalisation of the process established by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). We have put forward specific proposals. We are offering Prague as the host city of a permanent CSCE secretariat.Our interest in building a united Europe also determines our stand on the unification of Germany. Czechoslovakia considers the forming of a single Germany as an act in implementation of the German people's right to self-determination  the outcome of a democratic process and a prerequisite for definitively overcoming the division of Europe and for settling the outstanding issues of the Second World War.This year the United Nations ranks have grown even more with new Members joining the Organisation. We have welcomed in our midst the long-awaited Independent and free Namibia. We admitted Liechtenstein a few days ago. It gives me great pleasure to express my congratulations to both new Members from this rostrum. The principle of universality of our Organisation requires that it grant membership to all independent countries that show an interest in joining it  as is the case with the Republic of Korea at present. Freed from the shackles of confrontation  the United Nations my offers a wide range of opportunities for the advancement of international co-operation in all fields. For our part we shall do our utmost to that end. We reaffirmed this during the visit of the Organisation's Secretary-General to the Czech and Slovak Federal Republics this year. We are now offering a spacious palace in Bratislava  with numerous halls and conference rooms  no more than 60 kilometres from Vienna  for activities of the Vienna International Centre. We shall continue to support the peace efforts of the United Nations.Beginning next year we shall be ready to send  upon the request of the Security Council  a battalion-strength military unit to join in United Nations peace-keeping operations. We are prepared to act as mediators in the settlement of conflicts if we are requested to do so. It is our conviction that crises have to be settled solely on the basis of the United Nations Charter. Negotiation and the striving for compromise is  in our opinion  the only possible way out for the Middle East  Afghanistan  Cambodia  Cyprus and elsewhere. Peaceful rather than violent means should be sought to eliminate the shameful system of apartheid.Agreements on arms limitation and disarmament require verification and confidence-building measures. Therefore  we shall continue to publish data on our military expenditures according to United Nations guidelines. At the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva we shall contribute towards elaborating binding international instruments. We intend to become a party to the convention on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons as soon as it is finalised. We have published detailed information on our peacetime chemical potential. We have tested the feasibility of challenge inspections at chemical plants  as well as in military facilities. We have withdrawn our earlier reservation to the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in war. We are encouraging endeavours aimed at achieving a general and complete nuclear-weapon-test ban and we shall take an active part in the Conference on the Moscow partial test-ban Treaty in January 1991.We attach particular importance to the activities of the United Nations in the sphere of human rights. We are committed to this stand in view of the genesis of our revolution  and in view of our membership of the Commission on Human Sights from the beginning of next year - for the first time since the Commission was founded. We shall accede to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Bights and sign the Second Optional Protocol to the same Covenant concerning Ute abolition of capital punishment. We are preparing to accede to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and to the relevant Protocol. We are also making preparations for the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights. My country and Austria have co-sponsored at the current session of the General Assembly a proposal for the conclusion of an additional protocol on consular functions to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.Our endeavour to build up a country fully governed by the rule of law is inseparably linked with support for the rule of international law in inter-State relations. We are therefore withdrawing our reservations to the provisions in international conventions on obligatory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. I could name here a number of other steps through which we are seeking  often with a delay of several decades  to redress the consequences of the narrow-minded ideological approach of the undemocratic governments of my country to the development of the international community. But we want more than that: we want to learn from the experience of the past 40 years and use the resulting lessons not only for our own benefit but offer it to be used for the benefit of all.The aim of our peaceful democratic revolution was first and foremost to free men and women from fear  to restore to them their human dignity and freedom of expression  freedom to elect their own representatives and to build a State under the rule of law  to give our citizens the possibility of taking personal responsibility for their lives  for their work and its outcome. Thus in yet another part of the world there is now a growing belief that first we are human beings and citizens and only after that whites or blacks. Catholics  Muslins  or people without religion  Czechs  Slovaks  Americans  Chinese  Arabs or Jews  rich or poor  educated or illiterate  Westerners or Easterners  Northerners or Southerners. The colour of our skin  our nationality  religion or political convictions constitute personal characteristics that neither give us a right to put ourselves above others nor make us inferior. This applies to personal relations  to domestic and foreign policies of countries  and also to United Nations activities. Never again should the United Nations adopt one-sided positions that impair its credibility  such as it did once in the resolution identifying Zionism with racism.It is my opinion that the time has come for the United Nations to carry its original underlying idea further by formulating principles that would represent the common heritage of the development of the whole human civilisation  principles that have proved to be an essential pre-condition for the successful development of any society  regardless of the part of the globe in which it lives. We have a worthy foundation in the United Nations Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights covenants. We hope that all United Nations Members will adopt these documents as their own and that efforts will be made to ensure their uniform interpretation and consistent implementation.But let us go still furthers let us try to formulate principles of conduct for the world community to follow  so as to create a world economic space where each and every society  regardless of the level of its development and specific cultural traditions  would find its place  a world where opportunities and a chance of resolving social issues through prosperity  of raising the level of education and of having the voice of its national culture heard in the concert of world culture would be assured.This relates also to the environment surrounding us. The United Nations is certainly the forum best suited for the formulation and assertion of common principles for the conservation and improvement of the environment. We know from our own experience that interference with nature in one part of the globe influences the destiny of us all. We shall discuss this subject at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil. I hope that it will produce binding principles and set in motion broadly conceived programmes. In his message to the President of the Commission of the European Community  Jacques Delors  Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel  proposed that the European Community  together with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  set up a programme aimed at a continent-wide solution of environmental problems.I have already stated that after overcoming East-West bipolarity we can and must work harder than before to bridge the North-South gap. The conclusions drawn at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly on the revitalisation of economic growth can be inspiring but financial resources remain the essential factor. I am afraid that the present conflict in the Persian Gulf will again substantially limit the possibilities for development assistance. Already today  as a result of rising oil prices  the situation of many countries is becoming critical. However  financial grants or loans to the developing world cannot be seen as the only rescue. We have to look for other solutions as well. For instance  we must activate co-operation within regions or development areas. One of the available options might consist in the application of the plan I outlined at Harvard University last May for stabilisation of Central Europe and the USSR. We have suggested that the wealthiest States of the world set up a fund in the form of a dollar loan to the Soviet Union. That fund  to be administered by an international bank  such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  would be used to pay for supplies from Czechoslovak  Polish and Hungarian enterprises to the USSB. These enterprises would be required to invest a part of their dollar earnings in their own modernisation. The Soviet Union would undertake to invest the rouble equivalent of the sum paid from the fund in the development of their own economy. Nobody would get any money in advance; payments would be committed to specific effective programmes under the supervision of the respective bank. The stimulating effect of such operations on the development of local industries is evident. Such a proposal offers  of course  just a model that could be elaborated so as to suit the specific conditions in individual cases. Most of the attempts made so far involving an active donor and a passive recipient have failed. Why not try some other ways?Over the 45 years of its existence  the United Nations has gone through many a twist of fate. Yet  despite all drawbacks  it survived even the worst times of the cold war. Every third Tuesday in September those who would not have met otherwise met in this Hall: a thin thread connecting the international community was still there.The end of bipolar confrontation  linked with the sweeping changes in Central and Eastern Europe  is making possible a renaissance of the ideas enshrined in the Charter of our Organisation. I am confident that it is the United Nations through which the new era of co-operation  in an area extending from San Francisco to Vladivostok  will be projected into co-operation with the South  and that this will create the essential pre-conditions and make available the resources that are necessary to eradicate poverty and to solve the problems of the environment;One of the founding fathers of the United Nations - Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk  son of our first President - pointed out  as long ago as 1947  that there are four cardinal points  not just east and west. In vain did he call for the forging of a democratic chain to encircle the whole globe. After the fall of democracy in Czechoslovakia in 1948 he tragically ended his life with a fall from a window of Cernin Palace  the seat of our Foreign Ministry. Sometimes I take my visitors to that window  thinking about how he would rejoice to see that we are again taking up this dream of his with renewed hope. Let me therefore conclude my statement with the same words with which he concluded his at the first General Assembly session: ""So onward United Nations  marching as to peace""."
"37",1719,"CUB",45,1990,"﻿Our delegation is very pleased to see Mr. Guido de Marco presiding over the work of this session of the General Assembly  at a time of particular importance for the destiny of humankind. The contribution of Mr. de Marco's country within the Non-Aligned Movement and his proven capabilities and experience signal success in the work we have taken on. I wish to congratulate him most warmly on behalf of the people and Government of Cuba  and also on my own behalf.This is certainly a suitable opportunity for me to express our grateful appreciation for the work carried out by Major-General Joseph Garba as President during the last session of the General Assembly.To the new Member States  Namibia and Liechtenstein  I extend our best wishes on their joining this great family of nations and  by so doing  making that family more universal.The world has changed. Today the international situation is qualitatively different from what it was a year ago  when we met in this same Hall. The risk of a nuclear confrontation has diminished  along with the holocaust such a confrontation might entail. That is something to be welcomed. Progress is being made in the negotiations towards nuclear disarmament  negotiations which ought to be conducted with all States participating within the United Nations framework.The tensions stemming from the so-called East-West confrontation have practically disappeared  but the peace which now prevails is not the peace for which we have always fought - real peace for all States  weak and strong  large and small  in whatever continent. We say ""yes"" to peace  but we want it to be a worthy peace and a peace for all. We say ""yes"" to détente and co-operation  but we want it for everybody  not only between East and West but between North and South as well. We say ""yes"" to multilateralism and the United Nations  but we demand it for everybody  large and small  nuclear and non-nuclear Powers  developed and underdeveloped  rich and poor.We must not continue advocating détente  peace and development by pole or by latitude: these are problems of all humankind and hence they cannot be projected onto a map and then split up. For there to be peace  mere disarmament is not enough. Without development  there can be no peace either.The world has changed  and instead of East-West and North-South contradictions we now have a world with increasing problems in the South  a world where there are no signs that the economically developed States are willing to do their duty and contribute towards the tenacious development effort of those peoples that have suffered centuries of colonial and neo-colonial exploitation.In the Middle East  where there is continuing delay in the convening of an international peace conference in which all parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  would take part on an equal footing  we now see that after the end of the Iran-Iraq war and the beginning of a solution to the consequences of that conflict  a new situation has arisen: the occupation and annexation of the State of Kuwait by Iraq.Cuba  in keeping with its principled policy  expressed itself in the Security Council in favour of the adoption of resolution 660 (1990) against the invasion  and similarly came out  in so many words  against the annexation of Kuwait. For Cuba  strict observance of the norms of international law is the greatest assurance that can be given to all nations that international peace and security will really be maintained in the climate proclaimed by the premises and principles of the Charter.We have therefore constantly acted to promote a negotiated solution and avoid the outbreak of a war of incalculable scale whose immediate effects would be felt by all peoples in the region  and which would also have serious economic effects for all developing countries in general  given the importance of oil in the world economy. President Fidel Castro has contacted the Heads of State of the Arab countries  the President of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and other Heads of Government  and has given instructions for various steps to be taken within the Security Council itself.It is not possible  however  to disregard the fact that the United States is making use of this crisis to achieve  in its supposed role as planetary policeman  its old ambition to establish itself militarily in the Gulf area and to be able to do whatever it likes with the oil wealth of the region  which is of strategic economic importance for the whole world. The concentration of United States naval forces and those of Western countries in that region is enormous. They seek to fulfil a military role that no one has assigned them with regard to an effective blockade of Iraq. As a result  there is the more disturbing possibility that hostilities might break out by accident or by premeditated provocation  given not only the existence of nuclear-powered vessels  but also the reported presence of nuclear weapons in some of those vessels  a fact that certainly serves to exacerbate the crisis.The announcement by highly placed officials of the United States administration that such a military presence could be kept on for some time and that the sole effective means to get the Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait is to use military force  demands a reaction on the part of the international community  which cannot remain silent and must reject such notions. Cuba abstained in the vote on Security Council resolution 665 (1990) because we felt that its provisions would be tantamount to spreading a cloak of legality over the acts of blatant piracy that the United States navy had been carrying out in the Gulf  and over the adoption of measures not provided for in Article 41 of the Charter  which was the basis for the embargo against Iraq. Therefore  we do not accept the self-proclaimed role of policeman that the United States has assumed  nor the pressures it has been applying to prevent the sending of food and medicines to the civilian populations of Iraq and Kuwait  despite the provisions of Security Council resolution 661 (1990).We are surprised that the United States  which spent a number of years flattening Viet Ham  bullied tiny Grenada  and most recently sent its elite troops to invade Panama - among other similar actions in its long history of interventionism - should now pose as a champion of international peace and security. But we are even more surprised that those who have repeatedly opposed the application of sanctions by the Security Council against Israel for its repeated acts of aggression and its occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories  should now come forward as the principal advocates of those measures. Cuba rejects the haste that has been so evident in the preparation and adoption of new resolutions  which only add to the risk of a conflagration and are clearly incompatible with the supposed desire to exhaust political and diplomatic means.No State is entitled to set itself up as an arbiter with the right to decide when such efforts have been exhausted. The international community must not simply acquiesce in the sense of inevitability that tends to pervade the Council's resolutions. For Cuba  there can be an reasonable alternative to a negotiated political solution  which roust necessarily include the restoration of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait and the complete withdrawal of foreign forces deployed in the region. Resort to force  with all its devastating consequences for the peoples and wealth of the region  would set in notion an economic catastrophe for the countries of the third world. Even without the outbreak of war  the price of a barrel of oil has surpassed $40. What would the consequences be for the economies of the more than 100 States of the third world if actual military hostilities were to break out in the Gulf?At the same time  we wish to reiterate that basic foodstuffs and medical assistance are fundamental human rights that must be guaranteed in all circumstances for the civilian population of Iraq and Kuwait  as well as for nationals of third States in those territories. Hot even evacuation would provide a quick solution for all the citizens of third countries  because more than 500 000 Palestinian citizens will be unable to return to their homeland  which continues to be occupied by Israel. In numerous regions of the world  peoples continue to clamour for the establishment of peace  although the negotiating process has not yet met their legitimate aspirations.We now have a new  unified Yemen which Cuba salutes. Through the maturity and intelligence of its peoples and Governments  Yemen has overcome the division that survived the colonial inheritance that once divided them. The now Namibia  which after a long-drawn-out but no less heroic struggle  won its independence - to which we Cubans are honoured to have contributed - can now take its rightful place among us. That is another manifestation of today's new atmosphere. There have been developments in the Cambodian conflict  and the parties appear to be moving towards an agreement. But the process is still in its early stages and has not yet crystallised.The Government of Afghanistan is persistently and flexibly pursuing its policy of national reconciliation  despite the difficulties that one party to the conflict  with United States support  has been placing in its path  despite the Geneva Agreements. Cuba supports the just position of the Government of Afghanistan.The question of Cyprus remains deadlocked while the country remains under military occupation. Cuba reiterates its support for the legitimate rights of the Cypriot people; for dialogue between the two communities that compose it; for the establishment of a bi-communal federal republic preserving the unity  sovereignty  independence end non-aligned status of Cyprus; and for the urgent convening of an international conference on the question of Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations in order to resolve the matter.We support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Sahraoui State  as well as the withdrawal of the Moroccan administration and troops from the territory of the Western Sahara. We reiterate our support for the people of Lebanon in its just struggle for national unity and territorial integrity.We wish the People's Republic of China success in the process of integrating into its national sovereignty those parts of its territory and peoples that were wrested from it by colonial domination or imperialist intervention.Korea continues to be divided  although significant steps have begun to be taken that could lead to the long-desired reunification. In that respect  we reiterate our solidarity with the just policy pursued by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea.In Angola  where Cuba has been strictly and impeccably implementing the withdrawal of its military contingent as a result of the agreements arrived at  peace has not proved possible as a result of the actions of UHITA  which has been supported militarily and politically by the United States and continues its destabilising actions.In Central America  the atmosphere of tension has declined  although the people of Nicaragua  after the guns have fallen silent  is now striving to achieve domestic stability and to overcome the difficult economic legacy of the war imposed on it for so many years. In El Salvador  the process initiated between the parties  with the participation of the Secretary-General  has not been carried out fully. In Guatemala  steps continue to be taken towards a domestic solution  but with no rapid development in sight.Cuba wishes again to place on record its support for the just demands of the Argentine people to recover its sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and for the demands of the Government of Bolivia for a direct and useful outlet to the sea.The South African people  which in the recent past has achieved through its difficult struggle certain social changes providing a political space for the forces that have represented it  has not yet succeeded in doing away with all the barriers that exist or in burying once and for all the policy of apartheid. The international community must therefore continue to advocate the maintenance of economic sanctions against South Africa. Cuba reiterates that apartheid cannot be reformed - it must be completely eradicated. In the Americas  the Puerto Ricans  our brethren by virtue of blood and of struggle  still do not know when their land will cease being a colonial Territory of the United States. Indeed  at the very end of the twentieth century there are attempts further to impede their progress towards self-determination by means of the so-called referendum or plebiscite the United States Government is organizing  while the conditions are being readied to continue the spread of transnational corporations and nuclear military bases through the Territory in an attempt - a vain attempt - to erase its genuine Latin American identity and its historical and cultural roots.Notwithstanding the undoubted successes in the fight against colonialism in recent years  we must not forget that there remain more than 20 Territories with many millions of inhabitants still under colonial domination. The United Nations must redouble its efforts to make this decade the last for colonialism.Today the United Nations is the only forum suitable for confronting the major challenges facing mankind. The question of the environment  the drug problem and the needs of children undoubtedly require in-depth universal attention to find formulas for an effective solution. In all these cases  however  everyone must assume his share of the burden; it would be wrong to allocate the principal task to the developing countries or to lay the primary responsibility upon them.The Eighth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders  recently held in Cuba with a level of participation exceeding that of previous congresses and with results that have been described as very successful both by the United Nations and by participants  is an example of how the growing problem of crime must be confronted.We cannot omit two basic issues: disarmament and economic questions.We view disarmament not only as a necessity but also  first and foremost  as an imperative for peace. There has been progress - which we welcome - in the  process between the two major nuclear Powers to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons  and thus to remove the threat o£ nuclear conflict; but the danger has not yet been eliminated  and we cannot say that the progress made is irreversible.Cuba supports the possibility of converting the present partial nuclear-test ban into a total ban  in keeping with the demands of the international community.The failure of the recent review conference for the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty - where it was impossible to agree on the adoption of a final declaration - proves that there are still forces  in the United States in particular  which resist suspension of nuclear testing.We welcome the fact that the negotiations on conventional-arms reduction in Europe  in accordance with the special characteristics of that region  are moving forward.Intense work is under way on the subject of chemical weapons  but important questions remain unresolved. Cuba will continue to work in the negotiating body with a view to the swift adoption of a universal convention that will not impose limits or obstacles on the economic development of developing countries in this sphere  discriminate in any way among States parties or lead  through the retention by other States of their chemical arsenals  to weakened security for parties to the convention which do not possess chemical weapons.In the economic sphere  the contrast between the glimmers of light on the world political scene and the shadows which generally prevail in international economic relations is very disturbing. While there is a gradual process of detente and of closer relations between the two major world Powers and between East and West  North-South relations grow ever grimmer.In the decade that has just begun  we note that the abyss of inequality between the development levels of the industrialised countries and those of the underdeveloped countries continues to grow deeper  both in the economic and social sphere and in the area of science and technology.The wrongs condemned by President Fidel Castro in this Hall in 1979 have grown out of all proportion and have over the years reached unimagined levels. Horse still  there is no prospect of a real  lasting solution: the debt crisis  the net reverse transfer of financial resources  the growing deterioration of terms of trade  protectionism and diminishing sources of credit for development add up to a situation of total economic desperation and utter social insecurity for our countries. This is beginning to manifest itself in violent outbursts of social instability.Cuba's position on the external-debt crisis - which as President Fidel Castro has pointed out is now the main obstacle to development  the principal instrument for financial plunder and the most modern form of neo-colonial dependence imposed by developed countries - is well known to the international community. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive political solution to root out this evil; it must necessarily include total cancellation of the debt of all developing countries.One of the consequences of the debt crisis has been a constant deterioration of living standards in third-world countries. Almost 30 per cent of the economically active population is unemployed; more than 950 million people live in utter poverty; 195 million children below the age of five suffer from hunger; infant mortality is 10 times higher  on average  than it is in developed countries; 40 000 children die daily  most of them of preventable causes and of malnutrition; 900 million adults are illiterate; and hundreds of millions of people live in misery. That striking situation has caused us to dub the 1980s a lost decade for development. The longer we delay a substantive decision on this delicate problem  the more serious will be the consequences of inaction. Neither creditors nor debtors now doubt that the external debt of the underdeveloped countries is not only un-payable but uncollectable. The various modalities for exchanging debt for equity do not merely evidence a general acknowledgement of that fact  but also reveal that creditors are desperately scrambling to unload at the lowest possible cost debts they know cannot be recovered. Similarly  the various proposals made by the developed Hest in an attempt to resolve the crisis have proved inadequate and limited in scope - so much so that one can hardly talk of a global debt strategy at all.None the less  and bearing in mind the economic vulnerability of all our countries  Cuba is prepared to recognize and work on behalf of initiatives which  while not constituting substantive formulas  approach the question from an integrated and innovative point of view. This implies substantial debt reductions  the overall handling of all types of debt  and additional measures.In that spirit  my Government fully supported the results of the regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean on external debt  recently held under the auspices of the Latin American Economic System (SELA); this could be a good beginning for a serious effort to achieve a solution of the indebtedness that is crushing our peoples. Like the rest of the developing world  my country is confronted with an unjust and discriminatory system of international economic relations. Whatever efforts individual countries may make in one direction or another  they will always be restricted in a world in which the imbalances I have mentioned persist. Thus  Cuba reaffirms yet again the validity of the principles of the Hew International Economic Order. We are convinced that true economic co-operation that fulfils the needs of development and economic growth of the developing countries requires  at the very least  application of those principles in addition to such further measures as  inter alia  cancellation of the third world's external debt  elaboration of universal co-operation on environmental and development problems and an international contribution to the necessary processes of economic integration in those countries.I cannot conclude without pointing out that  as in previous years  pressures and threats are still being directed against our people by our neighbour to the north. The Bush Administration is the eighth United States Administration that has persisted in carrying out hostile and aggressive actions against Cuba. The United States Government  in violation of international law  and particularly the 1982 Nairobi Convention  went to great lengths to carry out its project for intrusion into our television space  for the purpose of destabilization  with a pirate television station based on United States territory.We state with pride that through our people's intelligence and tenacity  that new United States act of aggression has been thwarted at a low cost to Cuba and that the pirate signal has been eradicated from our land. We are now also beginning to eliminate radio broadcasts that are also being beamed from United States territory for the same purposes. None the less  the criminal economic blockade that has been imposed against us continues  along with the violation of our waters and airspace in the naval base the United States arbitrarily maintains in our country and its aggressive military manoeuvres around it.Cuba  as in the past  reiterates its just demand for the return of land illegally occupied by the United States on our national territory. Our greatest desire is to live in peace and to use all our resources for the noble purpose of economic and social development. Nevertheless  the political blindness of the most reactionary circles in the United States leads them stubbornly to pursue their vain attempt to bring the Cuban revolution to its knees. We have said before and we say again today: the socialism being built by our people came into being as a result of its own struggle  and our people is now defending that socialism as its most valuable acquisition  since with it has come the social justice that was for so many years trampled underfoot  along with true sovereignty and national independence. That people  which has known justice  independence and liberty  will not give them up and will defend them to the very last.For Cubans  for the 10 million men and women who work  create  build and are prepared to defend the fruits of their labours  the situation is clear: the struggle for the revolution  for socialism  is not only the struggle for a better future. It is also the only way to defend our independence and our national identity. We shall not falter in that endeavour. We are sure our struggle can only end in victory."
"38",1765,"CYP",45,1990,"﻿I would like to begin by offering you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on assuming the high office of President of the General Assembly. It is only fitting that Malta  a fellow non-aligned and United-Nations-minded country  should be given the opportunity to guide this session of the General Assembly to successful fruition. Your election adds weight to the truth that all countries  large and small  have a role to play in the world of today and that of tomorrow  I would also like to thank the out-going President  Major-General Joseph Garba  for his skilful management of the forty-fourth session  which saw the encouraging trend towards consensus resolutions continue.Allow me to echo the sentiments of previous speakers and welcome the Principality of Liechtenstein  a fellow small State  to the United Nations as its 160th Member  and allow me also to congratulate our friends from Yemen on their momentous decision to reunite their countries  and to welcome them here as a delegation of a united Yemen  although this means that we have one Member State less.I would also like to express our great appreciation and esteem for the work of the Secretary-General  so much of which is connected with Cyprus  whose instructive and thoughtful report we have read with great interest. We commend his skill and commitment in handling the affairs of the United Nations and in further promoting the goals and objectives of this world Organisation  which constitutes the moral and social conscience of mankind.In the 12 months since I addressed the forty-fourth General Assembly  we have witnessed a rapid and dramatic succession of political developments  Some of those developments have been positive beyond expectation; others  quite the opposite.When taken together  however  they indicate that we are at a crucial juncture in world history. Like all such turning-points  the current one involves a period of transition characterised by both great opportunities and great difficulties. Undeniably  the most important positive development of the past 12 months has been the coming to an end of the cold war between East and West  which was effectively buried in the rubble of the Berlin Wall last winter. Dialogue and co-operation are fast replacing distrust and confrontation.The euphoria generated by these positive changes  however  has already received its first sharp blow. The crisis in the Gulf triggered by Iraq's invasion and occupation of neighbouring Kuwait demonstrates that the long road to a truly peaceful world is not an easy one. The crisis  however  also brought to the fore a united United Nations  whose resolutions were given bite as well as bark.Cyprus  itself a small State and victim of military aggression by a larger neighbour  Turkey  strongly condemns the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. We firmly support the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and express the hope that they can be effectively implemented without the use of force  but implemented they must be  and the earlier the better for all. Let us in this respect express the hope that the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait will  as President Mitterand so eloquently stated from this rostrum yesterday  pave the way to a speedy resolution of the other outstanding problems of our region.I would also like to stress that there are very important lessons to be drawn by us all from the crisis in the Gulf  where the unrestricted supply of weapons and tolerance of other cases of aggression contributed to its happening. The first lesson is that despite  or even because of  the virtual erasure of the cold war lines of confrontation between East and Nest and the encouraging trend towards disarmament between them  regional conflicts may flare up in stark contrast to the peace epidemic on the broader East-West stage. As events on the United States-Soviet Union axis and in Europe divert attention from the periphery  as the structures of the cold-war client-State control mechanisms disintegrate and as arms merchants seek to replace lost or declining main-line markets  so the possibility remains that conflicts can arise with the potential to destabilize the entire globeHowever  the international response to the crisis carries a clear message of hope  and this is the second lesson. In a distinct signal that the old divisive order no longer stands  the United States and the Soviet Union  unilaterally and collectively within the Security Council  delivered fundamentally the same message: that the world community  in its overwhelming majority - I would say  in its near totality - is not prepared to condone aggression or the use of force as means of implementing national claims. Peaceful negotiations  with due regard to the principles of international law  are the only permissible way to settle differences. In addition  the Gulf crisis has highlighted the key role of the United Nations in the handling of international conflicts  both as a forum for discussion and debate and as a body with the structure and authority to produce collective decisions guiding the international response to a given crisis situation It also illustrated that the international community should not through the United Nations appease itself with words hut should seek ways to implement its resolutions through collective action  taking advantage of the changing order of world political relations.Security Council resolutions are as binding today as they were in 1974  but as we know only too well they have not always been implemented. The Republic of Cyprus has been a firm advocate of the implementation of United Nations resolutions since its admission to the world body. It was Cyprus that proposed that the item ""Implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations"" be inscribed on the agenda of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. That item is again inscribed on the agenda to be discussed in plenary. I think that the time is now ripe to consider seriously the significance of Security Council resolutions in particular and United Nations resolutions in general and as a whole  and to seek ways to ensure their transformation from mere words into deeds. In this regard  it is fitting to refer to the work done to date by the Committee on the United Nations Charter and the Strengthening of the Role of the Organisation and to express the view that we should now give serious and effective attention to the work of that most important Committee.Turning to the rest of the international political scene in this period of transition  a survey of developments yields a similar mixed message of hope and warning.There is no doubt that the reunification of Germany in early October - in a few days from today - is a landmark event. Only a year ago  the Berlin Hall separated German from fellow German. Families that had been divided since the early 1950s were reunited. The speed with which the changes have taken place is of lightning proportions and we extend our most heartfelt congratulations to the people of Germany and our beat wishes for every success in addressing the challenges of reunification in which East and West go forward hand in hand.In Cyprus  we too dream of the day when the Military wall of separation is finally dismantled so that Greek and Turkish Cypriots may too go forward hand in hand. This is our dream and guiding force as we approach the marking of the thirtieth anniversary of our independence.In both Eastern and Western Europe - the epicentre of the historic changes which spelled the end of the Cold War - the process of fundamental and rapid economic and political reforms is gathering momentum. On the one hand the European Community is moving forward towards a single European market in 1992 and speeding up the process of economic and political integration. On the other  concurrently  the new emerging market economies of Central and Eastern Europe are in turn establishing the economic and political frameworks that will ensure their future prosperity. It is in the interest of the whole world that  when completed  these two processes make President Gorbachev's inspired vision of the Common European House  or the European confederation envisaged by President Mitterrand  a reality.We all express the hope that the path of democratisation that the countries of Eastern Europe have embarked on will not be undermined by the daunting economic problems that face them  nor by the clearly re-emerging nationalistic tendencies that are challenging the very fibre that binds the State as a single actor on the international scene. It is of extreme concern to us all to witness In Europe and in other parts of the world this current upsurge of nationalism based on ethnic  religious  racial or tribal differences. No one here should be in any doubt that if this trend is allowed to fester its spiralling effect will be disastrous. We must recognise and accept that the interests of any one group within a country cannot be achieved through the oppression of other groups or the redrawing of the map of the world along sectarian or schismatic lines.In South Africa  despite the serious problems that continue to exist  the beginning of the end of the abhorrent regime of apartheid has now been signalled by the start of talks between the African National Congress and the South African government of Mr. de Klerk. We hope that this trend is an irreversible one. In the same region  the past year has seen the historic transition of Namibia to independence  with which a major step was taken towards the reduction of tensions which threatened global stability. Once again  one cannot praise enough the role and work of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in the realisation of Namibian independence.We particularly welcome the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to work together for a mutually acceptable solution to the problem of Afghanistan  where the continuing civil war  despite the peace accords of 1988  is claiming many lives and causing untold hardships among the proud Afghan people.We are heartened to note the progress made among the five permanent members of the Security Council in the search for a solution of the Cambodian problem. We welcome the acceptance by all the parties to the conflict of the framework agreement reached by the five for a solution. The envisaged role of the United Nations is again evidence of the new found convergence of views among the five permanent members in the resolution of conflicts and of the importance of the United Nations in their resolution.We note with concern  however  the lack of progress towards the peaceful resolution of other regional conflicts and disputes. In the Middle East  the Gulf crisis has increased our concern over the interrelated problems of Palestine and Lebanon. The speedy and effective resolution of those problems as a vital element of comprehensive and lasting peace in the region is of particular concern to Cyprus and its people. We denounce the continuing oppression of the brave Palestinian people in the occupied territories. Effective negotiations must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We support the establishment of a Palestinian State as well as secure borders for all States in the area.We continue to deplore the tragedy in Lebanon and the unending suffering of its people. Cyprus remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance to its Lebanese neighbours. For the sixteenth year Cyprus stands before this world assembly pleading for its voice to be heard. It has been 16 long years since another invasion and occupation unfolded in the eyes of the world  much like the one we have recently witnessed  and unfortunately the scars of that invasion still remain open.Cyprus continues to be forcibly divided. Turkish troops continue to occupy about 40 per cent of its land. Thousands of refugees are denied access to their homes and properties. One thousand sis hundred nineteen persons are still missing as a result of the Turkish military operations. Our cultural heritage  which has existed for thousands of years and is the common heritage of mankind  is being plundered and obliterated. Furthermore  foreign settlers from Anatolia are still being brought in and settled on Cypriot soil  thus changing its demographic structure. The menace of foreign settlement is also threatening Varosha  a city under the control of the Turkish army since its inhabitants were forcibly expelled during the invasion of 1974.And all of this is in total disregard of a plethora of resolutions passed not only by this Assembly but by the Security Council as well. Those resolutions clearly and unequivocally call for the reversal of all these acts of flagrant violation of international law. And yet the discouraging chasm between words and deeds today remains as wide as ever.Many would have given up hope. However  the strengthening of the United Nations and the reinforced expectation of respect for and implementation of its resolutions is a development from which we draw hope. We are also heartened by the statements of world leaders that no peaceful international order is possible if larger States can devour their smaller neighbours  and that we must demonstrate beyond any doubt that aggression cannot and will not pay. If these words are transformed into deeds  then we shall finally be able to overcome the ills of aggression and set Cyprus on the course of peace and prosperity for the benefit of the whole of its population.A just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem necessitates that negotiations are entered into in good faith and are result-oriented. We have  tine and tine again  displayed our commitment as well as our good will during the course of negotiations. We have presented proposals to the Turkish Cypriot side going far beyond the protection of cultural  religious  and linguistic identity  aiming at creating a federation consisting of two regions  one to be administered by the Turkish Cypriot community and the other by the Greek Cypriot community.Unfortunately  Turkish demands that would have amounted to a permanent partition of Cyprus have  according to the Secretary-General himself  pushed the inter-communal dialogue into an impasse.Despite the many difficulties  we are resolute in our determination to move out of this impasse. Particularly in today's climate  which favours implementation of United Nations resolutions and the overcoming of divisions  Cyprus cannot be the only exception.We will persist in our offensive of good will and communication with our Turkish Cypriot fellow-citizens. We shall continue to promote contact and co-operation over whatever barriers or obstacles are placed in our way  convinced that these efforts will contribute to the impetus towards the security of our people and our country in a democratic federation. We will also persevere with our proposals for the complete demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus  which will be of benefit not only to the Cypriot people but also to the whole region. No obstacles will derail us from our goal of a united  sovereign  territorially integral Cyprus  her freedom  justice and human rights for all Cypriots will not be regarded as a luxury but as the vary basis of human assistance.Let me take this opportunity to state in no uncertain tones that we shall continue to afford the Secretary-General our full support and co-operation in his efforts to achieve a breakthrough by way of result-oriented negotiations. Cyprus must not be left to suffer any longer from the catastrophic consequences of the maxim ""might means right"". .Aside from the political or military oppression of the small by the large  the existence of economic oppression can be just as serious  and its repercussions are just as disastrous. The growing gap between the rich and the poor is a major problem which threatens to act as a time bomb in the foundations of the more peaceful world we are trying to build  unless it is defused in time.This issue was discussed at length at the special session on international economic co-operation here in New York last spring. The latest World Bank World Development Support shows that more than one billion people in the developing world are constantly condemned to live in conditions of destitution  with an income of less than $370  not per day or per week or per month  but per annum. As a result  40 000 children die every day due to avoidable causes.The strategy for tackling the problem of development should  I believe  have three facets. First  effective and imaginative measure are required to tackle the developing countries $1.3 trillion debt problem  combining debt forgiveness  the use of the so-called peace dividend in the form of funds saved from the reduction in military spending as a result of the disarmament process  interest recycling and any other measures which can alleviate the debt burden. And we must not forget that if the Governments will do nothing about the debt problem  then the market forces will take care of it  and the results would not be to their liking. Secondly  measures are to be taken to improve commodity prices  the low levels of which are directly related to the exacerbation of the debt problem in the 1910s  combined with steps to open up international markets to developing countries products through the abolition of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Unfortunately  we have to note that the negotiations for the Uruguay Sound are dangerously delayed  and progress will cone only as a result of courageous political decisions. But progress is needed. Thirdly  initiatives must be created to encourage investment which will act as a vehicle for the transfer of technology to the developing countries.The developing countries must be allowed to share in the benefits of the technological revolution if they are to be able to develop successfully in the increasingly competitive international environment. However  they also have the responsibility of responding to such multilateral action  thereby maximising the benefits that will accrue from efficient domestic economic policies.We meet here today against a backdrop of threats to the very survival of our planet. The drive for economic development has brought us to the brink of ecological disaster. The figures are indeed alarming. Since the middle of this century global economic production has increased five-fold and the total world grain production has more than doubled  but not without placing a monumental strain on this planet. In the same period the world's crop-land topsoil has been eroded by SO per cent; 20 per cent of the world's rain forests has also been destroyed; the ozone layer has been depleted by over 2 per cent world-wide  while tens of thousands of plant and animal species have become extinct.Effective international action is required now to stem what could become an irreversible tide towards disaster. Sound economic development policies must go in tandem with sound ecological management policies. While recognising that the responsibility for repairing the damage caused to the Earth's fabric rests with those primarily responsible for causing it  namely the developed countries  we all have a responsibility to shift from development policies that deplete our natural resources to ones that preserve them. The establishment of a global fund for the environment  to which countries on the basis of national income may contribute  could generate funds for nature conservation world-wide and demonstrate our united commitment to dealing with a problem that affects each and every one of us. We must remain equally united in our commitment to fighting the global problem of drugs in all its aspects production  trafficking and use; for  just as the destruction of the environment undermines our fundamental resources in the form of trees  water  the air and the soil  so the drug epidemic continues to undermine our precious natural resource in the form of human beings themselves.I began by saying that we find ourselves at a crucial turning-point in history. If we rise to the opportunities which have now been opened to us we can take a giant stop forward in the direction of a more prosperous  more peaceful world  making the twenty-first century a century of peace  co-operation and achievement. If we succumb to the difficulties and fail to raise this day of opportunity and hope  then we stand to regress to a period of conflict and destruction even more terrible than anything we have already witnessed in this century.The burden of responsibility is heavily and squarely on our shoulders. What it entails is placing the common good above our own immediate narrow interests; for we must recognise that in the long term that which is to the benefit of the whole international community will also be to the benefit of its individual members.The crisis in the Gulf; the problems of unequal international economic development and the economic migration that it creates; the issue of environmental conservation; the social problems of drugs and AIDS - all clearly show that none of us can go it alone any longer  and that no one can shut the door on daily occurrences in the rest of the world  for development transcends international barriers in a way that makes isolationism impossible. We must all survive together or perish together. Let us work in the framework of a reinvigorated United Nations to ensure that the world will not perish but survive to become a better place for ourselves and our children. "
"39",1833,"DDR",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  I wish to thank you on behalf of the German Government for your congratulatory words. The establishment of German unity and the agreements connected with it are  as you have rightly remarked  historic events.In his speech during the general debate Foreign Minister Genscher said that in this hour Germany is conscious of its European and global responsibility and that it will reader its contribution to peace and freedom in Europe and in the world. Developments in Germany are part of the immense transformation taking place in Europe  which gives us a chance to overcome the division of the old continent.When the Federal Republic of Germany was admitted to the United Nations 17 years ago  our then Foreign Minister  Halter School  stated in the General Assembly that it continued to be our political objective""to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will recover its unity in free self-determination"". Foreign Minister Genscher reaffirmed that position in many speeches in this Assembly.We are happy that we have now achieved that goal  and we are grateful. German unity is the result of a peaceful democratic process in which the entire German nation has exercised its right of free self-determination.The united Germany has no territorial claims against any other country  nor will it have any such claim in the future. It will confirm the existing frontier with Poland in a treaty binding under international law. This will be a major contribution to the peaceful order in Europe now being established.After unification the Federal Republic of Germany will remain integrated into the European Community and the Atlantic Alliance. The Federal Republic's renunciation of the manufacture and possession of  as well as control over  nuclear  biological and chemical weapons loses none of its validity. The recovery of our unity and full sovereignty will not alter our active commitment to the work of the United Nations. We shall do everything in our power to neat the great challenge· of our time: safeguarding peace and human rights  promoting economic development and social justice in all parts of the world and protecting mankind's natural resources.As a developed industrial country  the Federal Republic of Germany is conscious of its responsibility towards the less developed nations. In his message on the occasion of German unity Chancellor Kohl emphasised that we shall not invest in German unity at the expense of the third world. On the contrary  we shall step up our efforts to combat poverty and underdevelopment and to protect the environment.In this historic hour we commemorate the victims of the Second World War  of tyranny and of the Holocaust. We remember all those who suffered injustice. We are aware of our responsibility.To the Germans 3 October is a day of joy  of deep emotion and of reflection. We thank all those who have supported the legitimate rights of the German people and placed their trust in us."
"40",1851,"DEU",45,1990,"﻿I wish first of all to offer you  Mr. President  my warm congratulations on your election to your high office. You are guiding the foreign policy of a country with which we have close  friendly relations. We are partners with Malta in developing security and co-operation in Europe. With you as its President this session of the General Assembly is in good hands.I wish as well to express my thanks to your predecessor  Ambassador Joseph Garba  for the way in which he conducted his presidency.Our special thanks and appreciation go to the Secretary-General. We are determined to continue to support his courageous and far-sighted initiatives. You  Mr. Secretary-General  have opened up new ways in which the United Nations can successfully perform its peace keeping role. I take great pleasure in the fact that Liechtenstein  a neighbour with whom we have a close relationship  has become the youngest member of this family of nations.I extend a cordial welcome in this Assembly to the representative of Namibia  a country with which we are closely associated by virtue of our history  our friendship and our joint efforts to secure its independence.We warmly congratulate our friends the people of Yemen on having achieved unity. We sincerely hope that the Korean nation  too  will soon be able to overcome its division.I welcome the statement of fundamental significance made by my Italian colleague  Mr. De Michelis  on behalf of the European Community. We spoke in our name as well.Over the past year the situation in Europe  and with it the situation in Germany  has undergone fundamental change. Never has it been more obvious how closely Germany's fate is linked with that of Europe. The unity of Germany is a step towards the unity of Europe. The third of October 1990 will be the day of German unity. Xo us Germans  this will be a day of rejoicing  gratitude and reflection. Our long-cherished desire to unite in peace and freedom will be fulfilled. This is a source of great pleasure for us. The world is following the unification of Germany with good will  sympathy and friendship. For this we are deeply grateful.In this historic phase  the Germans are filled with a sense of history and responsibility; they are not being carried away with nationalistic exuberance. We will not forget the endless suffering that was brought upon the nations of Europe and the world in the name of Germany. We commemorate all the victims of war and tyranny. We recall  especially  the untold suffering inflicted upon the Jewish people. We are aware of our responsibility and we accept it. To the General Assembly of the United Nations I address this message: We Germans are united in the determination that none of this must ever be allowed to happen again.Our nation will live united again in one democratic State. That State  our common State  will be founded on respect for inalienable human rights. Only peace will emanate from German soil. For all time  the principles enshrined in our Constitution  human rights and human dignity  democracy and the rule of law  social justice and respect for creation  peace and good-neighbourly relations will govern our thoughts and our actions.As an equal partner in a united Europe  we are resolved to serve world peace. This commitment  which is embodied in the preamble to our Basic Law  determines our policy. It is a rejection of power politics; it implies a policy based on responsibility.Ever since it joined the United Nations  the Federal Republic of Germany has demanded in this world forum the unification of our indivisible nation. Every year since 1974  I myself have declared in the General Assembly our determination to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation would recover its unity in free self-determination.On every such occasion  I also had in mind the Germans living in the region I personally come from  the German Democratic Republic. I knew they longed for German unity just as much as we in the Federal Republic of Germany  but they were not able to express their feelings and views here in this Assembly of the United Nations. Now  however  they have demonstrated their commitment to freedom and unity. Together with the  we now rejoice in German unity. We know that it will bring unity for Europe  too. So today  united in heart and in will  we greet the nations of the world. This occasion fills me with deep gratitude  gratitude which I also extend to my colleagues James Baker  Roland Dumas  Douglas Herd and Eduard Shevardnadse who  especially in recent months  have done so much to help us achieve this objective.The recollection of last year's session of the General Assembly indicates the problems we had to solve. At that time  we were still involved in laborious negotiations to open the door to freedom for the thousands of Germans confined in our embassy in Prague.My thanks goes out also to the courageous Hungarian people  who were the first to lift the iron curtain.We Germans realised all along that only peace and the ending of Europe's division could lead to the unification of our country. We seized the opportunities for co-operation. We renounced the use or threat of force and have kept that pledge. We banked on the peace-inspiring strength of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We established a political order based on freedom in the Federal Republic of Germany.With the support of our friends and partners  we regained the confidence of the nations of the world  and thus established one of the foundations for German unity. Milestones along the road are the Federal Republic's membership in the Council of Europe  the Western Alliance and the European Community. By taking these steps  we returned to the community of democracies.Through the treaties of Moscow and Warsaw and the treaty with Czechoslovakia  the foundations were laid for a new relationship with our Eastern neighbours. And the basic treaty with the German Democratic Republic created a modus vivendi between the two German States for the time the nation remained divided. That German treaty policy also opened the way to the Helsinki Final Act. The momentum of the process of the Committee on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the radical reforms in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev ultimately made it possible to end Europe's and hence Germany's division.The peoples of Central and Eastern Europe chose the path of peaceful revolution leading to freedom and democracy. Each of their decisions was a decision in favour of Europe. Through their peaceful revolution the Germans now uniting with us have demonstrated to the whole world their belief in freedom  in unity and democracy  and hence in Europe.We thank our friends and allies in the West. They have stood by our side in good and in difficult times. To the American people in particular I wish to says we shall never forget the airlift to Berlin.On the eve of German unification we convey our thanks to President Bush  President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Thatcher for their support  their statesmanly far-sightedness and their understanding of our nation's longing for unity.We thank our friends in the European Community headed by the President of the Commission  Jacques Delors  and we thank our friends all over the world.We are grateful to President Gorbachev. His courageous policy has opened Europe's way to a new future and given Germany the chance to recover its unity in freedom. This also means a great deal for the future of German-Soviet relations.We Germans want nothing other than to live in freedom and democracy  in unity and peace with all our neighbours. In the Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany  which we signed in Moscow on 12 September  with France  the Soviet Union  the United States of America and the United Kingdom  we Germans reaffirmed the united Germany's responsibility for peace.With our policy we aim to set a good example. We reaffirm our renunciation of the manufacture of  possession of and control over nuclear  biological and chemical weapons. We renew our commitment to the rights and obligations arising from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons. Our decision to reduce the personnel strength of the armed forces of the united Germany to 370 000 is a significant German contribution to extensive disarmament in Europe.The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against other States and will not assert any in the future. The inviolability of national borders is s corner-stone of Europe's peaceful order. The united Germany will confirm the existing German-Polish border in a treaty that is binding under international law. Our relationship with Poland is a special manifestation of our European calling. We therefore intend to establish in an additional  comprehensive treaty the basis for a new chapter of good-neighbourly relations between Germans and Poles. Germany recognises and accepts its responsibility to help build a better future for Europe. We want  not a German Europe  but a European Germany.We belong to the European Community. On 1 January 1993 the common European internal market will have been completed. It will be an open market and thus generate fresh impulses for the world economy.We want the European Community to be an economic and monetary union and a political union. As the European Community's identity grows on the way to European union  we do not want the Atlantic to grow wider. A transatlantic declaration by the European Community and the North American democracies will add a new quality to our community based on common values and a common fate. The more quickly we achieve  European union the more we foster the unification of the whole of Europe. On the path to European union the European Community is already becoming increasingly attractive to the whole of Europe. The nucleus of this unique link between the European democracies is the close Franco-German friendship. We pledge ourselves to that friendship as one of the permanent foundations of all German foreign policy. On 3 October 1990 all Germans will be bound up in the European Community and in the Franco-German friendship. The sovereign  democratic and free Germany will be committed to unity  stability and progress is the whole of Europe.The united Germany will carry greater weight. With it we shall not strive for more power but shall be conscious of the greater responsibility such additional weight implies. We shall accept this responsibility in Europe and around the world. We shall place our weight on Europe's scales in such a way that it will benefit all nations on our continent and hence the whole of mankind. In this way we shall help Europe meet its responsibility is shaping the emerging new world order. Our conduct will bear out all those who confidently support the process of German unification.A new concept of the coexistence of nations is taking shape. It is based on the awareness of the global challenges and of global interdependence. It takes into account the world's responsibility for future generations. It is the concept of equal rights for large and small nations  of limiting national powers through the transfer of sovereign rights to community institutions  of the interlocking of economic interests  of regional solidarity and interdependence. This concept and not yesterday's policy based on hegemonic aspirations and equilibrium is the model for stability and prosperity in the Europe and in the world of tomorrow. We Germans are contributing our regained sovereignty to that concept. To Europe this means that the ideological causes of tensions must not be supplanted by now ones resulting from different standards of living. How that the wall has come down and the iron curtain has been lifted we do not want new divisions to take their place  divisions arising from poverty  social injustice or the disparate treatment of nature. The whole continent must be committed to parliamentary democracy  respect for human rights  the principles of social market economy; social justice  protection of the natural sources of life and the peaceful coexistence of nations. Only in this way can the one Europe emerge.Over 40 years of division have left scars in Germany and Europe; the healing of those scars will require great political and economic efforts.We regard our contribution to the reconstruction of Europe as an Investment in the future of our own nation as well as in that of Europe. In this we perceive our European calling - the European calling of us Germane. The unification of Germany will not cause us to forget the aim of unifying the whole of Europe.Our aim is a Europe based on solidarity and partnership which will fulfil the expectations of all European peoples. Solidarity and partnership must prevail  not rivalry and hegemony. The establishment of a Bound political  economic  social and ecological framework for the process of transformation in Central and Eastern Europe is the main objective of a stability-oriented European policy in which the military factors increasingly lose their significance.Our economic and political weight and our position at the centre of Europe place a special responsibility on us Germans in this respect and we are facing up to this responsibility.In this connection we have always been aware that the Soviet Union belongs to Europe. Without the Soviet Union there can be no united Europe.With the German-Soviet Treaty on Good-Neighbourly Relations  Partnership and Co-operation  which was initialled in Moscow recently  the two countries intend to shape their future together. We want to be able to trust one another in every respect. The Treaty affords the basis for this. Other members of the European Community also arm negotiating co-operation agreements with the Soviet Union. Through such close co-operation with the members of the European Community  the Soviet Union is tying its future to that of Europe.The international economic and financial institutions will also have to take this new development into account. Mew thinking is called for everywhere.We are also seeking close co-operation with all our neighbours in Central and South-eastern Europe  with which we have many traditions and interests in common.The ending of the East-West confrontation und the development of a new relationship between the member States of the two alliances open the way for a new system of co-operation in Europe in the field of security as well. The changing North Atlantic defence alliance and the European Community  to which the united Germany too will belong  as well as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will be pillars of this new system. They will be pillars of a new development in which military security will be complemented by a broader and more solid foundation for co-operation aimed at safeguarding peace. The members of both alliances no longer regard each other as adversaries  nor as a threat.Fifteen years ago the 35 signatories of the CSCE Helsinki Final Act pledged themselves to freedom  democracy and respect for human rights. Developments since then have borne out that bold decision of 1975. The summit conference due to be held in Paris on 19 November will raise the CSCE process to a new level and create the first common institutions of the new  the one  Europe.Regular meetings of Heads of State and Government and of Foreign Ministers  а centre for conflict prevention and a secretariat will provide the first  solid foundations for a lasting peaceful order throughout Europe based on co-operation. A new grand perspective is opening up for Europe. As a country situated in the heart of Europe  the united Germany aware of its pan-European responsibility will do anything possible to ensure that this perspective becomes a reality for all Europeans.  The CSCE in Europe is developing  step by step  with our active participation  into a system of European co-operation  security and stability. The North American democracies are involved in this process as natural and important partners. The fact that the CSCE Conference of Foreign Ministers is to place here  on American soil  nest week is of symbolic importance.Disarmament and the creation of co-operative security remain the key to the common European house. The disarmament negotiations must keep pace with the dynamic political developments. The pending conclusion of the Vienna negotiations on conventional disarmament will have to be followed as soon as possible by negotiations aimed at eliminating short-range nuclear missiles. Further steps to reduce forces are necessary. We urge the overdue conclusion of a convention providing for a global ban on chemical weapons. These barbaric swans of destruction must be eliminated worldwide. By reducing their nuclear weapons  the super-Powers are meeting their obligations to mankind. The universal validity of the non-proliferation Treaty must be assured for the sake of man's survival. Co-ordinated international efforts are needed to prevent the dissemination of delivery systems for nuclear  biological and chemical weapons.But disarmament measures do not automatically remove armament factories. Economic expediency must never be accepted as justification for the manufacture of weapons which threaten peace in other parts of the world. The third world must no longer be the market for armaments which disarmament agreements in Europe have made redundant. Consequently  further disarmament agreements should bind contracting parties to use surplus capacities for peaceful purposes.For years  we have been calling for greater transparency with regard to exports of weapons. Now this matter is acquiring greater urgency and receiving support. I welcome Foreign Minister Shevardnadze's initiative in this respect  the compulsory registration of arm exports with the United Nations should he introduced immediately and all violations of this requirement should be severely punished.The conversion of armaments factories to the production of civilian goods is a global task in the cause of peace. We are prepared to co-operate with any nation in this new and important field of international security.We observe the signs of a new age not only in Europe but also in the efforts to solve regional conflicts - from Central America to Afghanistan  from Cambodia to Korea. In the Middle East  the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people has to be reconciled with Israel's right to exist and its security. In the Republic of South Africa the aim is to overcome inhuman apartheid. We hop· the dialogue between the representatives of the black Majority and those of the white minority with the aim of completely removing apartheid  will quickly prove successful.We condemn Iraq's aggression against its Arab and Islamic neighbour against a Member of the United Nations Kuwait. The community of nations cannot tolerate the invasion and annexation of a country. The human rights of innocent people of all nations have been violated. There is no justification and no excuse for such conduct. Aggression must be treated as aggression  blackmail as blackmail  and the volatile of human rights must be treated as the violation of human rights if the world's sense of right and wrong is not to be injured.As always  it is the poorest of all who suffer most as a result of this kind of conflict. Oil prices are rising. Those first to feel the effects are the developing countries which have no sources of energy. Years of hard work are being undone. Never before in its history has the United Nations taken such a united and determined stand against an aggressor. Never before has an aggressor had less chance of splitting an international community acting as one.Time does not work for Saddam Hussein. Only the three routes charted by the Security Council will lead Iraq out of its self-imposed isolation: the complete and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait; the restoration of that country's full sovereignty; and the immediate release of all hostages. The refusal of the Iraqi leadership to meet these demands is a challenge to the whole community of nations. We give our unqualified support to the implementation of these resolutions of the United Nations. Aggression cannot be  must never be  rewarded. The determination and joint action of the Members of the United Nations can mark the beginning of a new peace-keeping role for the world Organisation. All Members must recognise and live up to their responsibility. No desire peace for the nations of that region  and we desire the unity of the Arab world  which has been destroyed by Iraq's aggression.The opportunities for developing a new world order lie in solidarity and joint action. They must be taken. The family of nations acted wisely when  after the terrible experience of two world wars  it placed the responsibility for safeguarding world peace in the hands of the United Nations. There is a good chance now - as there never was in the past - of the noble aims enshrined in the United Nations Charter being comprehensively achieved. The ending of the East-West conflict has helped make this possible. Ideological barriers are falling. The settlement of conflicts by military means is becoming increasingly outlawed. Rule of law is acquiring greater significance.And thus attention focuses on the Organisation whose task it is to resolve differences among nations by peaceful means. This is the historic hour of the United Nations. The peace-keeping potential of the Charter must be fully exhausted. The community of nations must throw its whole weight behind the Secretary-General's efforts to maintain world peace.The termination of the East-West conflict will release considerable material  spiritual and political energies with which to overcome the global challenges confronting us; the elimination of famine  poverty and underdevelopment in the third world; the overcoming of the debt problem; and the protection of the natural sources of life. The United Nations can now  at long last  play its proper role in shaping an interdependent world  a world which must be governed by a sense of mutual responsibility rather than by power politics. We all know that the challenges facing mankind as a whole no longer leave any country free from responsibility. The one world in which we have been placed requires new  joint efforts on the part of East and Nest  North and South  new systems of co-operation and of securing peace  both global and regional. A single State  however great and powerful it may be  is in ever-increasing areas incapable of coping with those challenges alone. The one world calls for joint action  globally and regionally  on account of its vulnerability  which is assuming threatening proportions  but also on account of the many unused opportunities for its development. Interdependence and co-operation are the factors governing the now age we are entering. A new ethical standard is required for the on· world. It must b· a standard of shared responsibility for the world as a whole  for the common environment  and for our common posterity.Thus a new community of mutual responsibility should emerge as the basis of a new world order - a global order embracing the diversity of nations  their cultures  traditions and religions; an order in which all retain their identity in mutual respect and in which all can live together  reconciled with each other  a global order of peace and co-operation  of freedom and human rights  demands  above all  social justice. True peace exists only where all human rights are respected.The two United Nations Covenants protecting political as well as economic and social rights must be viewed together. Nowhere must they be simply empty postulations; their practical application to all is needed. A decent human existence also presupposes an unharmed environment. It presupposes the preservation of man's natural sources of life. The safeguarding of global peace demands sot only the ending of man's war against man but also the ending of economic exploitation. It also demands the ending of man's war against nature. There should be a third United Nations human rights covenant to protect the natural sources of life.The task of the United Nations in this decade is to develop the international legal system further in order to ensure mankind's survival. Never before has it been more important to contemplate the consequences for posterity of the political  security  economic  technological and environmental decisions we take today. However before has a generation's responsibility for the future been greater. But never before have there been such opportunities for new thinking and new action  we Germans intend to devote our talents  our experience and our economic resources to the common effort to accomplish this huge task.The reorganisation of industry in the new federal states which are about to become a part of our country and our assistance for the reforms being undertaken in Central and Eastern Europe confront us with huge problems. None the less  we shall make even greater efforts to meet our responsibility towards the third-world countries. Our contribution to their development through the transfer of know-how  technology and capital will increase  not decrease. Solidarity with Central and Eastern Europe does not imply that we are turning away from the third world. The group of countries capable of using and willing to use their material resources to create a better world will on the whole grow larger.The economic reforms in Central and Eastern Europe  including the Soviet Union  will not only open up new opportunities for the countries concerned but third world nations too  will derive benefit from the larger markets  from the more intensive international division of labour and from the more efficient use of scarce natural resources. In this way German and European unification will produce its peace dividend for all regions of the world.New thinking and new action are possible only if all concerned recognize their own mistakes. Only then will North and South find solutions to the problems of the future. Only thus shall we all be able to meet our special responsibility in the quest for a global civilization capable of survival.The development of a market- and ecologically-oriented civilization which is both pluralistic and yet collective and capable of coping with the problems of tomorrow is the real challenge at the end of this century. Economic freedom must not become self-destructive. Technological advancement has made it possible for us to give the world a more humane countenance. But if we fail we shall destroy the sources of life not only for ourselves but for future generations. A strategy for ensuring mankind's survival must assume the place in our thoughts and in our actions which has up to now been reserved for the preservation of national interests  often enough through power politics and the weight of our arms policy.This above all else is the global conversion of thought and action which we must all achieve both as States and as individuals. We must together embark on solutions which will open up to a world population numbering over 6 billion at the end of this millennium a tangible common perspective for life in decent human conditions. A number of important conferences lie ahead. They must be used for this purpose.The report submitted by the South Commission chaired by Julius Nyerere shows that a new language has been found a language in which ""own"" mistakes too are admitted. This report shows that the third world is meeting its responsibility in the one world and for the one world. The industrial countries must respond to this signal. New thinking and new action is called for on both sides. The opportunities for a new beginning in the dialogue between North and South based on fairness and partnership and with each side prepared to learn from the other have never been better than at this moment.The termination of the East-West confrontation has freed that dialogue from ideological ballast. This makes it easier to concentrate on the real problems of development. An open dialogue between North and South is the major political task of the present time. We must face up to this task and we must do so now.The indebtedness of the developing countries and its paralysing effects on economic growth and development continue to increase. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates it will rise by 7 per cent to over $1.3 trillion by the end of 1991. Despite progress with the implementation of the extended debt strategy  no breakthrough has been achieved. On the contrary: in view of higher oil prices and interest rates  prospects for the debtor countries have clearly deteriorated. The international financial organizations must do even more to meet their responsibility for development in the third world.The Uruguay Round must end successfully  especially for the sake of the developing countries. Their growing integration into the world economy must also be reflected in the shaping of general economic conditions. The greatest development resource is the people in the developing countries themselves. These people must be given a hope must be given prospects for the future  for themselves and for their children. The World Summit for Children this coming weekend will provide important stimulus.The key problem in terms of global ecology is the rapid growth of the world population. Only by means of a global equalisation of burdens in which national economic policies set new priorities in order to level off the extreme disparities in living conditions will it be possible to change general social  economic and cultural conditions in the third world to such an extent that large families will no longer need children as a means of supplementing the family income or as old-age insurance.Family planning schemes alone will not have any lasting effect on birth rates. They must be complemented by measures to ensure basic economic and social security  gradually to rectify the unjust distribution of income and to improve educational opportunities in many countries.No one can want the excessive consumption rates for commodities and energy to continue to increase in the industrial countries  or that this trend should be continued by over 6 billion people at the end of this decade. That would spell ecological disaster. All of us in the industrial countries must change our way of life. Governments can help by offering market incentives  by regulation and by redistributing tax burdens. The environment-friendly use of resources and the recycling of materials must be made worthwhile for companies  but not the squandering of energy and other resources.Another key problem is the changing of the world climate through the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer. Bach of the Earth's many environmental problems will be exacerbated if these two central problems are not solved. Air pollution  the extinction of species and erosion  will increase dramatically and reduce the chances of survival of future generations.The Federal Republic of Germany  being a signatory of the Hague Declaration of the spring of 1989  regards the decisions taken at the Paris economic summit in July 1989 as the political basis for an international convention to protect the Earth's atmosphere. That convention should be signed as a framework agreement at the world Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992. Supportive measures under the aegis of the United Nations are indispensable if changes in present energy policies are to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and trace gases.The good-example policy as regards environmental protection will be continued after the unification of the two German States. A policy for safeguarding the environment is also a policy for safeguarding world peace. Responsibility for protecting mankind's natural and cultural heritage is one of the classic responsibilities of the United Nations as it seeks to maintain world peace. This was impressively confirmed by the World Charter for Nature which the General Assembly adopted in October 1982.We all have the choice of either definitively and irrevocably destroying the Earth within a few decades or adopting a responsible attitude and beginning to use nature's resources and energy sensibly on the basis of partnership and in a genuinely environment-friendly manner. This means that we must first soberly take stock of the situation  taking into account the consequences for the environment of aberrations ranging from energy wasting to the present climatically damaging exploitation of tropical rain forests to name only two of the many global ecological problems. But it implies  above all  admitting our omissions  our thoughtlessness  and our deliberate blindness to approaching disasters. Let us be serious about the principle of responsibility.We all realise that we are confronted by global challenges that affect everyone’s survival. The safeguarding of peace  economic development  social justice  disarmament and the protection of life's natural resources are those global challenges. The task of coping with them requires all our energies  ideas and efforts.The division of my country and of Europe and the East-West confrontation have been a heavy burden on us all. Ideological confrontation  power politics and the striving for superiority over others forced us all into an anus race. They divided Europe and the world. All this has tied up considerable energy. That energy is now being released. We can use it together in Meeting our global responsibility for a peace-keeping task on a scale unprecedented in the history of mankind  that is  for the one world.On the eve of its unification Germany declares to the family of nations: Ho shall meet our responsibility in Europe and in the world; we shall meet our responsibility for Europe and for the world.When on the night of 2-3 October 1990  we Germans unite  our mood will be one of gratitude and joy  of reflection and responsibility. It will unite us with the hopes  wishes and objectives of the nations of Europe and of the world. The united Germany will render its contribution to peace and to freedom in Europe and throughout the whole world. "
"41",1889,"DJI",45,1990,"﻿Allow me at the outset  on my own behalf and that of my delegation  to extend our sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your long  proven record in public service  coupled with your broad  diplomatic skills and keen sensitivity to the manifold issues before us  makes you uniquely qualified to guide us  with a sure hand  in our deliberations.I wish also to take this opportunity to convey to your predecessor Mr. Joseph Garba  our sincere appreciation of the fine leadership qualities he brought to bear on the conduct of the last session.We are proud  as usual  to recognize the quiet but effective diplomacy ceaselessly employed by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  both in his quest for enduring solutions to the many intractable conflicts and in his efforts to enhance awareness of the key problems of development. We value highly his wise and just stewardship as he perseveres in steering us carefully away from collision and confrontation towards co-operation and consensus. His report on the work of the Organization is very much to the point  and objective and comprehensive.Today is the day Germany reunites  meaning the end of the indifference to the sufferings and deprivation of the people on the other side of what used to be called the wall. We salute the new German State  which symbolizes the realization of the aspirations of the German nation. In the same vein  we also wish to record our deep joy at the merger between two sister nations  North and South Yemen. The Middle East has suddenly become explosive. This region has had  it must be said  more than its share of deprivation and suffering. It is most distressing to see the usually innocuous Arab family squabble degenerating into tragedy by the sacrifice of Kuwait  a small State but one rich in resources  on the altar of a more powerful neighbour's greed  so dividing the ranks of the Arab countries.Your inaugural address set the tone  in clear and eloquent terms  when yousaid: ""The international community's commitment to the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members is for all States  but in particular for the small States  the guarantee against the threat or use of force against their integrity and independence"". (A 4S PV.1. p. 6)The invasion and continued occupation of Kuwait by Iraq is an intolerable anachronism  incompatible with the norms of international law. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait cannot be subject to compromise. Djibouti stands with the international community in its effort to resolve the Gulf crisis. We call for the unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait  the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait and the release of all hostages  regardless of race or nationality. We therefore express our resolute condemnation of Iraq's invasion and illegal occupation of Kuwait.We are very distressed by the ever-more-distant prospect of an Iraqi pull-out  the more so because Iraq's continuing intransigence will doubtless make an already tense situation worse  posing grave risks for the region in particular and the world in general. We therefore strongly urge the Iraqi authorities  on behalf of their people  Arab honour and integrity  to be extremely cautious and very flexible  in order to avoid the imminent danger of the disintegration and devastation of all that Arab resources and ingenuity have accomplished over a quarter of a century. The United Nations is at the threshold of a new era free of rancour and ideological divisions. This is the first session of the General Assembly after the cold war which is likely to consider defining the nascent  new world order  and by so doing making the commitment of the United Nations to collective security an effective one. We are deeply encouraged to see the Security Council beginning to exercise  in accordance with the Charter  its ""primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security"". We earnestly hope that this fresh optimism will not be confined solely to selected areas of conflict  but will rather extend to all regions  and particularly to the most intractable problem  that is  the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and internationally recognized national sovereignty.Despite this fresh optimism  born of the improvement in the international political climate  the Middle East remains at boiling point because of the suffering of the Palestinians. The intifadah  a mass revolt by the people against oppression  carnage and foreign domination  has of course not faded from the scene. The Palestinians live in a precarious situation of continuous danger. That the Palestinian problem is still not being discussed in a dialogue or at a properly structured international conference is a clear sign of the terrifying stalemate in international diplomacy. In this context  Israel will surely never make one step forward towards peace before violence destroys any chance of there being any peace.We urge the United States to use its considerable influence over Israel to put an end to Israel's intransigence. Israel has become impervious to international reprobation and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The historic changes in the policy of the Palestinians  that is  cessation of all hostilities and acceptance of the two-State principle based on relevant United Nations resolutions  required unequivocal reciprocity on the part of Israel: acceptance of the principle of land for peace  and full restoration of political rights to the Palestinians  including their right to self-determination.Outright rejection of the notion of the Palestinian State is wholly unjustified. Pressing for increasingly unilateral concessions from the Palestinians without a corresponding flexibility from Israel would in no wise serve the cause of peace.In Lebanon  fratricidal wars are exacting a heavy toll on the defenceless civilian population. Fifteen years of sectarian civil strife  compounded by proxy war waged on its soil  have caused untold destruction and suffering  and have created confusion  division and anarchy. We are hopeful that the new initiatives taken by the Government of Elias Harawi will go a long way towards restoring peace  security and stability in Lebanon.We welcome independent Namibia to the community of nations. Nearly three decades of continuous diplomatic efforts to overcome the impasse have finally borne fruit  and Namibia is now in our midst as a free and sovereign nation. We take pride in its commitment to peace  human rights and economic pragmatism. Such a positive spirit of leadership shall pave the way for genuine national reconciliation.In South Africa  the word ""change"" is being overplayed in the mind and emotions of the black majority. President De Klerk continues to give the impression to his country and the world that an era of change lays ahead. Yes. there is a demonstration of an intention to carry out reform programmes. The freeing of Mr. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners is a move in the right direction. South Africa  however  remains a country beset by deep-seated mistrust and division. Much needs to be done to translate Mr. De Klerk's platitudes and ambiguities into a meaningful and irreversible reform programme.We strongly recommend the scrapping of repressive measures and institutional racism  the end of the undiluted minority rule  the affirmation of political and economic rights  and the creation of democratic institutions. When talking of change or hope  we can but recall the immortal prophecy of the late Alan Paton  that indefatigable literary giant and anti-apartheid activist  who over 30 years ago wrote:""South Africa is the kind of country where one is filled with hope on Monday only to be catapulted to utter despair on Tuesday.""The new Constitution must offer full political rights to the majority black population on a non-racial  pluralistic and democratic basis. To that end De Klerk should institute credible measures for the release of all political prisoners  the lifting of the state of emergency  the abolition of the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act which  taken together  form the core of the perpetuation of the reprehensible system of apartheid.With regard to Liberia  we express our deep concern about the continuous conflict and sufferings of the civilian population and the loss of thousands of human lives  as well as the influx of refugees. The Republic of Djibouti calls upon the belligerents to put an end to the massacre of the innocent population  to end the fratricidal conflict and to lead the country towards a peacefully elected government. Djibouti welcomes the peace agreement concluded recently by the four factions in the Cambodian conflict. The decision to establish the Supreme National Council  a transitional legitimate body that will reunite all the parties to the conflict  is an essential step towards a political settlement of the Cambodian question. We strongly encourage a general  peaceful settlement  which will lead the Cambodian people to a free  independent State  peaceful  united  neutral and non-aligned.With respect to the Western Sahara  we support the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity directed towards the search for a lasting solution to the problem.We are a few months away from the third anniversary of the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan and  as yet  there is no prospect of peace in sight. We believe that peace and tranquillity will continue to elude the Afghan people in the absence of a representative and popularly elected Government.In the Korean peninsula  we are quite encouraged by the continuing dialogue between the two States  and hope that these exchanges will effectively contribute to an improvement in relations and further enhance the prospects for peaceful unification. In accordance with the principle of universality and consistent with the earnest desire to ease tensions in the peninsula  we support the admission of both Koreas  separately or simultaneously  to full membership in the United NationsA clearer demonstration of the relaxation of the hitherto existent tension in super-Power rivalry is the World Summit for Children  which has just concluded a major and bold undertaking to save millions of children from ill-treatment  misery  sickness  poverty and malnutrition.This is not an exclusive phenomenon of the impoverished third world. Many children in the rich world live below the poverty level. Children comprise the largest segment of the world population of 5 billion. According to depressing statistics collected by UNICEF  children are poorly treated and are frequently the victims of neglect  murder  ill-health and slavery. The Summit  which brought together the largest number of Heads of State and Government in history  committed itself to an international action to safeguard the rights of the child. They addressed such important issues as ensuring child survival  protection of children and enhancing child development.This unique Summit is indeed a true vindication of the relentless efforts and dedication of UNICEF to mitigate the plight of children. We wish to express our deep appreciation for the remarkable support and guidance that UNICEF continues to provide to Djibouti as it attempts to implement its priority programmes of child welfare  immunization and maternal care.Problems of structural underdevelopment  poverty  drought and famine continue to plague and frustrate the genuine aspirations of many developing countries  in particular  in Africa and Asia. Africa has the lowest life expectancy  highest infant mortality  lowest literacy and highest population growth rates in the world. These grim statistics do not bode well for a continent already in the midst of stagnation or indeed a reversal as compared to the gains made in the 1960s and 1970s. Africa’s poor economic performance in a difficult international situation  the chronic drought  deteriorating terms of trade  weak international demand and high debt-servicing costs continue to cause grave concern. While the long-term growth prospects have economic policy implications in regard to improving human capital  mobilising domestic savings and promoting exports  we must at the same time recognise the inherent structural problems. Some of these are insurmountable so long as external constraints - such as dwindling export earnings  lack of finance for development  and a staggering debt-servicing burden - weigh down the African economies. These constraints severely limit efforts at economic restructuring and policy reforms intended to enhance recovery and bring about sustained growth and development.The adverse affects of the crippling external debt are boundless  with debt-servicing swallowing up over 40 per cent of Africa's export earnings.According to paragraph 59 of the ""Economic Report on Africa  1989"" by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa: ""The continuing rise in the volume of debt and the debt ratio underscores the excessive burden imposed on African economies and their vulnerability to adverse external developments. The proper understanding of the African debt crisis  therefore  requires it to be placed within the framework of the concomitant adverse developments in commodity prices and resource flows and the on-going efforts of adjustment"".Most of the initiatives designed to alleviate the debt burden unfortunately seem to share a common strategy  linking debt-relief or debt-rescheduling arrangements to medium-term adjustment programmes  with a strong element of structural reforms  which in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank jargon ""are aimed at reducing economic distortions and financial imbalances"". More often than not such a strategy does not produce the desired results. Instead  it engenders hardship and civil turmoil.Perhaps it is not so much a question of whether the strategy is mistaken as whether it is truly relevant to the level and pattern of development of most developing countries  in particular in Africa  where zero economic growth continues to be the rule  despite the presence of the largest number of foreign advisers per capita in the world. That undeniably lies at the heart of the problem. Otherwise  why are economic and social conditions in Africa today significantly worse than they were 15 years ago  given the substantial financial and technical assistance from the World Bank  the IMF and the developed countries?It is high time  therefore  that the major international development agencies acknowledged the uniqueness of this group of countries  and devised a new philosophy and programme meeting the specific needs of human development on a grand scale.Here we wish to record our deep satisfaction at the timely and generous decision taken by the French President  François Mitterrand  during the Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held recently in Paris  to cancel the entire outstanding public debt of all the least developed countries  subject to the approval of the French Parliament  and to commit France to increase its aid to that group of countries to 0.2 per cent of gross national product by the end of the decade.In this regard  as President Mitterrand suggested  we invite the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank  the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OBCD) as well as the other countries belonging to the Organization  to give grants to the least developed countries  instead of loans  so that the debt problem shall not continue ad infinitum. The provision of additional resources in the form of grants is the best way to achieve growth which will not add another twist to the debt spiral experienced by those countries.Alarming environmental hazards are increasingly posing  or could pose  severe threats to human survival. We tend to treat environmental issues  such as degradation  resource-depletion  hazardous solid waste and pollution  as mere passing phenomena. Disasters such as desertification  destruction of tropical rain forests  drought and famine have left a lasting impact on large part  of the world  and particularly Africa. We are convinced that environmental issues cannot be separated from economic development  and the realisation should provide the desired impetus for a collaborative effort co-ordinated at all levels. It was in response to this common concern that six countries in East Africa forged environmental unity by establishing the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and  Development (IGADB). Headquartered in Djibouti  ĪGADD is fast becoming a catalyst in the formulation of regional projects and of general policies in every member country. We express our gratitude to the many countries and organizations that continue to support IGADD and provide it with much-needed financial resources.Despite satisfactory and substantial advances being made in various socio-economic sectors  Djibouti remains a poor country  still far from achieving many of its development goals. Unfavourable climate conditions  declining economic activities  a constant influx of refugees  and overstrained social services militate against sound and steady progress. We are confident that the international community will continue to support Djibouti's genuine development aspirations.As we are a small country  our meagre resources have already been strained by the pressure of thousands of refugees from conflicts elsewhere in the Horn of Africa. The Gulf crisis has inevitably created political pressures and worsened the economic situation. Djibouti's economy depends largely on shipping activities and subregional trade. All of those activities  already experiencing a set-back  have now been heavily curtailed by the current crisis. For energy Djibouti is totally dependent on oil  which is primarily imported from the Gulf.IN conclusion  I wish to stats that the Republic of Djibouti has a vital interest in peace and the creation of a climate of confidence in our part of the world. For a young nation  small and lacking in essential resources  the maintenance of a reasonable degree of internal harmony and the pursuit of a realistic and prudent foreign policy go hand in hand. Our positive regional and international diplomacy will continue to be matched by pragmatic domestic policies. "
"42",1911,"DMA",45,1990,"﻿Permit me to congratulate you  Sir  and your country  Malta  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. It is an honour which is richly deserved and which I am sure you will carry with due dignity and authority. I pledge the full support and co-operation of the Commonwealth of Dominica in this task. I also wish to take the opportunity of commending your predecessor for the quality of leadership he displayed during his term of office.I feel deeply honoured and profoundly privileged to be making my speech in the Assembly at a time when such significant and far-reaching changes are taking place  both in the world at large and in the Organisation which brings together the leaders of the world in the critical task of securing international peace  security and development.This final decade of the twentieth century is turning out to be one of the most turbulent in recorded history. Yet in contrast to other periods of great and revolutionary change  many of the most far-reaching changes are taking place in an atmosphere not of violence end war  but of negotiation  conciliation and compromise. Whole systems  entrenched for half a century are being examined and evaluated  often overturned and discarded  or at least radically reformed  but all from within  through a battle of intellect. The two great Powers of the century  which have expressed totally opposing ideologies and postures in the past  are now standing shoulder to shoulder and appear truly to be committed to co-operative action towards the ideal of international peace and security. That is truly a remarkable achievement for which much of the credit must go to the boldness  courage  perspicacity and perseverance of the President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev  as well as to the open  constructive response of the West.The Commonwealth of Dominica enthusiastically welcomes the fall of the Iron Curtain  the end of the cold war  the democratization and decolonisation of such of Eastern Europe  and the new spirit of friendship and fraternity  communication and co-operation between East and West. We look forward to the day when the tremendous resource  which have heretofore been tied up in the instrumentalities of hostility between those two great world blocs can be released and redirected to the effort to bring development  social justice and peace to the entire world. The existing inequalities in today's world  of extremes of wealth and wastefulness on the one hand and poverty and privation on the other  cannot be tolerated in this new world which is emerging in the twilight years of the twentieth century. While profound changes are taking place in the world  much remains unchanged. Many small States in the world continue to b· highly vulnerable to external economic influences and to subversion from within and invasion and annexation from without. The Commonwealth of Dominica  as an extremely small Stat· with experience of this vulnerability  is concerned that the international community must develop new approaches and new concepts for the protection of the security of small States and the preservation of the democratic process where these are threatened by elements hostile to the ideals of the United Nations.In our region  recently in Trinidad and Tobago  virtually the entire Cabinet was taken hostage by a small band of disaffected terrorists who effectively paralysed the entire country and held its population to ransom because of their belief that they could solve the intractable problems of the third world  as manifested in Trinidad and Tobago  more effectively than could the incumbent  democratically elected  legitimate Government of that country. This action almost destroyed the social and political structure of that country and has certainly set back its economy several years. The ripple effect of this tragic event has had  and will continue to have  an impact on the economies of the other Caribbean States  including my own. My country highly commends Prime Minister Robinson and his Government and people for their courage in standing up to the threats - in some cases to their very lives - and in refusing to make concessions to these terrorists. The security of the States of the Caribbean region and of Central America is severely threatened by the scourge of international drug trafficking  which has become one of the most serious problems of the Caribbean region. The implications are obvious. The incredible financial resources of the Central American drug cartels  or for that matter of drug rings in many parts of the world  outstrip many times the financial resources of States. Experience has shown that  militarily  it would not take much to achieve the violent overthrow of the established order in these States of the region.We want to take the opportunity to express our profound admiration for the courage and perseverance of successive Governments of Colombia in their fight against the scourge of drug trafficking. The international community  in our view  should give greater recognition to the sacrifices being made by the Government and people of Colombia  not only on their own behalf  but perhaps more particularly on behalf of the consumer nations of North America and Western Europe. The production and trafficking of narcotic drugs will not stop while the consumer nations are willing to buy the product at the prices which they are prepared to pay. Until we eradicate drug abuse from our societies  none of us can feel safe. Consumption must be more vigorously attacked  but  as well  the producer nations and their peasants must be enabled to earn a living through legitimate activities  the necessary supports for which must be provided in an appropriate manner.We hold in the highest possible esteem  not only for ourselves but for peoples all over the world  the principles of national sovereignty and territorial integrity  and the right of peoples to determine on the basis of their own free choice the destiny of their nation.One of the most impressive events of the age is the manner in which the entire world community has come together in condemnation of the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait. That dastardly act has succeeded in unifying countries which have been bitter enemies  in defence of а common cause. However  the fact that almost the entire world can stand behind this common cause is itself a remarkable achievement. The Government and people of Dominica stand firmly behind the legitimate Government and the people of Kuwait  and while we cannot do much in practical terms  we have shown our solidarity by prohibiting all trade with Iraq and Kuwait while the occupation of Kuwait continues  and we express our readiness to comply fully with Security Council resolution 661 (1990).We wish to reiterate here the importance of full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and for the settlement of inter-State disputes without resort to the threat or use of force. We join our voice to the voices of those many States in demanding that the Government of Iraq immediately cease its aggression against the legitimate Government and people of Kuwait  and withdraw all its military personnel from the territory of that State We welcome recent progress towards a negotiated settlement of the situation of Cambodia  directed towards enabling the Cambodian people to determine their own political future through free and fair elections organised and conducted by the United Nations in a neutral political environment with full respect for the national sovereignty of Cambodia. We express the hope that the spirit of constructive compromise will prevail and that the people of Cambodia can soon effectively express their will in relation to the governance of their country.The progress of Namibia towards independence and democracy is a matter of deep gratification for the Commonwealth of Dominica and for the Organisation. The world community must continue to support that country as it builds its institutions and exercises its independence in the years ahead.The new effectiveness of the United Nations  evidenced by all these developments  is to be noted with deep satisfaction. The rapprochement between East and West; the end of the cold war; the new emphasis on development rather than ideology  have enabled the United Nations after all these years at last to begin to play the constructive role in the maintenance of international peace and security that it was established to play. The Security Council  in particular  has been able to achieve a truly remarkable level of unanimity and constructive action on such critical issues as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait sanctioned by the United Nations  and the United Nations efforts in assisting the refugees created by that conflict.The new spirit of co-operation which has emerged between the super-Powers in the last several months has enabled the United Nations  at last  to begin to fulfil the mandate of its Charter.Perhaps this new spirit of co-operation will make possible a negotiated settlement of other issues in the Middle East. I am referring  in particular  to universal recognition of the right of Israel to exist within settled and secure borders  as well as of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own. Recent developments in the Middle East may present new opportunities for a satisfactory settlement of these intractable problems. Every opportunity must be seized to achieve comprehensive peace and stability in that region.The unification of Germany and the liberation and democratisation of much of Eastern Europe carry tremendous prospects for the future. However  many of these emergent democracies will require assistance in their effort to transform their societies from politically controlled and economically planned societies into market economies and open  democratic societies. We whole-heartedly encourage the international community to lend every support to these efforts  the equally emphatically assert  however  that assistance to the emergent democracies of Eastern Europe should not be at the expense of traditional - and already inadequate - levels of assistance to the developing countries  which have been the traditional recipients of development assistance. We urge the international community  and more particularly the industrialised nations o£ the world  to seek out and identify creative ways to divert the tremendous resources  both human and financial  which have heretofore been poured into sustaining a non-productive cold-war effort into a new drive for the development of the developing countries of the world. We need now to see a rationalisation of the use of the world's resources: an application of those resources to bring about an acceptable level of international economic justice. The developing world must be helped to break out of the cycle of poverty and deprivation which has persisted for so many years  to escape the humiliating dependency which we now suffer  and to be able at last to stand on our own feet in meeting the essential needs of our peoples. This  however  will never happen as long as the relationship between the rich and poor nations  and the trading patterns which exist today  persist as the basis of our existence. And  of course  so long as there is no justice there will be no peace.Much progress has been made in South Africa in the last 12 months in breaking the grip of apartheid  that inhuman and abominable system for the oppression and exploitation of man by man. The entire world community has long abhorred this abomination  but many countries have been unwilling to do anything about it anything  that is  that would effectively break the stranglehold of the power structure and secure the eradication of that horrendous imposition on the fundamental human rights of millions of black  coloured and Asian South Africans. How  through the struggles of the South African peoples themselves  supported and given heart by the unwavering solidarity of many nations represented here; through the shedding of their blood and the sacrificing of their liberty; through their persistence in confronting the injustice of apartheid even at the greatest imaginable risk; through the boldness of children and the fortitude of women  it begins to appear that justice  after all  can prevail. There begins to appear a glimmer of light at the end of the dark tunnel. In this connection  I cannot avoid mentioning Nelson Mandela  a man who  even as he has faced the challenges and grappled with the problems of the new South Africa into which he has been at last released after 27 years of imprisonment  has demonstrated the depth of wisdom and the strength of his character  uncompromising in principle but remarkably flexible in his approach  a man of great vision  who is prepared to sacrifice ell of himself  as he has incontrovertibly demonstrated  for the good of his people and for the triumph of justice. I salute this great hero of the twentieth century  whose greatest virtue is his humanity  whose wit and sense of humour  tolerance and love  have survived the greatest imaginable odds  and who has emerged smiling and brilliant  challenging the assumptions on both sides of the battle and opening up ways towards a solution.Doubtless  some of those who have sanctified him while he was in prison will criticize him now that he is grappling  in an entirely principled but pragmatic fashion  with the very real problems of negotiating transition to majority rule while preserving the country - not the structures of apartheid - from a possible collapse into chaos and anarchy. The course he has navigated is a very difficult one  fraught with hazards and obstacles. It requires a giant such as Mandela is  with the wisdom  integrity  tolerance and courage which he has acquired over many years of struggle  to prevail. We are confident that under such leadership the people of South Africa shall overcome. In the mean time the pressure for real progress must be maintained. The Commonwealth of Dominica has heeded the call of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and appeals to all the nations of the world that are concerned about human rights and are committed to the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain economic and other sanctions against South Africa until real and irreversible progress has been made towards the goal of ""one person  one vote"" in South Africa.The Commonwealth of Dominica is committed to eradicating nuclear weapons and other investment of mass destruction from the face of the Earth. To that end we have ratified the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and are negotiating a safeguard agreement. We have supported the initiative to declare the Caribbean region a nuclear-free zone and urge that that concept should be perpetuated and disseminated over an ever-increasing area of the world's surface. The Commonwealth of Dominica urges the international community to work vigorously towards nuclear non-proliferation and the eventual total abolition of all nuclear and chemical weapons.Too many nations spend too high a proportion of their national wealth on armaments. Even poor  developing countries spend millions of dollars on armaments at the expense of the development of even basic amenities for their peoples. It would be naive to hope for the elimination of expenditure on armaments. However  the world should apply its best efforts to minimise expenditure on destructive weaponry and apply our talents and resources instead to development  peace and justice.We have noted with satisfaction the reunification of Germany  and in our region the four Windward Islands of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States are working vigorously towards the establishment of a unified State made up of those four separate and independent States. In that contest  we note with satisfaction the recent efforts which indicate a new seriousness in the approach of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the issue of the reunification of Korea. We realise that there are many difficulties in the way of that process of reunification. We affirm our full support for the objective shared by both North and South Korea that their country be reunited. At the same time  we do not share the view that the process towards unification should stand in the way of United Nations membership for the Republic of Korea or for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  if they desire it. We note that separate membership in the United Nations did not prevent or in any way retard the progress of East and West Germany towards reunification. North and South Yemen were not obstructed in any way by separate membership of the United Nations in their drive to unify their country. We in Dominica  Grenada  Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will not allow separate representation in the United Nations to stand in the way of our unification.If the Republic of Korea  an independent sovereign State  seeks membership in the United Nations and is willing and able to carry out all the obligations of a Member State in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations - as we have no doubt it is - the Commonwealth of Dominica will support its application for membership.Reverting to the Caribbean region  I wish to touch upon the traumas being suffered by the people of our sister State of Haiti. Liberated from the brutal dictatorship of the Duvalier regime  the country now finds it difficult to break out of the dictatorship of terror that appears to be so much a part of Haitian life. But it appears to be in a perpetual see-saw of rising hopes and dashed dreams  to such a point where one wonders at this stage whether cynicism has overcome hope. But it is said that ""hope springs eternal in the human breast""  and while it is for the people of Haiti to work out their destiny  surely it is for their neighbours and the international community to lend appropriate encouragement and support to the efforts of the local population.The cycle of violence and terror that has dominated the life of Haiti for such a long time must be broken. We endorse and support United Nations initiatives to contribute to the organisation of free and fair elections in that country  so long deprived of the opportunity to attend seriously to the legitimate needs of its people in an atmosphere of peace and security. Indeed  we urge the United Nations to place much greater emphasis on this problem and not to treat it as merely peripheral.Lastly  on a more positive note  the government of the Commonwealth of Dominica has  over the years  been developing and implementing a very comprehensive programme to promote the prudent use of natural resources for social and economic advancement. Such a programme is of critical importance in an island setting with fragile ecosystems  limited physical conditions end pressures from competing interests for scarce land resources.Recent developments on the global level have prompted my Government to pursue its environmental management programme with much urgency and commitment. Issues such as global warming  depletion of the ozone layer  tropical deforestation  inadequate housing and poverty are seen as matters to be tackled immediately while searching continuously for long-term solutions.In an effort to diversify the nation's economy  tourism has been given greater priority and Dominica is being promoted abroad as the ""nature island"". Indeed  our small nation is very rich in natural and cultural resources which are found nowhere also. Dominica has an abundance of forests  wildlife  rivers  lakes  waterfalls and sulphur springs. Such outstanding natural features are complemented by numerous historical sites and archaeological features. It is logical  therefore  that the development: and promotion of those resources must he carried out with the highest regard for environmental consequences  in order to achieve the goal of sustainable development.The Government of Dominica has embarked on a systematic approach to sustainable development. One important component of that programme is the setting up of forest reserves and national parks. Today 20 per cent of the total land area of Dominica has been legally declared either forest reserves or national parks. The forest and park systems plan has identified other areas for inclusion  but the present system consists of two forest reserves and two national parks. Those forest reserves and parks and the resources found in them provide the base for the development of tourism on the island. Therefore our policy of tourism calls for environmental protection and enhancement.The Commonwealth of Dominica takes pride in the fact that its citizens today enjoy clean air and water and an environment relatively free of most of the problems faced in other parts of the world. We are well aware  however  that those conditions are not likely to exist much longer if the present indiscriminate and world-wide destruction of the environment continues.While recent approaches to environmental questions by the industrial nations give reason for hope  the international community needs to commit greater resources to the eradication of practices that result in the pollution of our rivers and atmosphere  the depletion of our forests and the indiscriminate discharge of industrial wastes into the oceans of the world. After all  we must be guided in the end by the proposition that we are mere trustees of this Earth and we should endeavour to pass it on to future generations in a condition which will allow them to enjoy the full gifts of nature. The recent World Summit for Children affords us the opportunity to reflect on the impact of the issues of drugs  war  justice  development and the environment on the children end therefore on tomorrow's world. We must take up the challenge and seize the opportunity today if we are to escape the harsh judgement of tomorrow's history.I wish the United Nations continued growth in influence and effectiveness as it seeks to respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world."
"43",1954,"DNK",45,1990,"﻿I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of this General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I am confident that you  like your predecessor  will give us wise guidance in our efforts to achieve tangible results at this session.When the founders of this Organization net in San Francisco in 1945 they had a common vision: a vision of a peaceful world where peoples lived in tolerance as good neighbours  a world of equal rights of men and women  of nations large and small  a world of social progress and better standards of life in greater freedom - all based on a firm belief in the dignity and worth of the human person.This vision has only partly materialised. We have not yet been able to save our planet from the scourge of war. Fundamental human rights are still being violated in many countries  causing human suffering and heavy flows of refugees. Freedom and democracy remain elusive in too many nations. Hunger and poverty afflict millions of people.And new scourges have emerged: the ugly face of terrorism  the degradation caused by drugs  the environmental problems  the dreaded and deadly virus causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) ~ to mention but a few.However  there is no reason to despair. On the contrary  important parts of the vision are being realised  and increasingly so. An invigorated world Organisation is assuming its responsibility in an atmosphere of growing co-operation and realism  determined to settle disputes by peaceful means based on the rule of law. The tide is changing. Peace  freedom and democracy are gaining ground. We must counter any attempt to stem that tide. Our first priority should be to prevent the use of aggression and military power for political ends. We must make it abundantly clear that military aggression will never be tolerated  will never succeed  will never pay.Iraq's naked aggression against a peaceful neighbour  Kuwait  represents the most blatant violation of all fundamental principles of international law. Its demand that foreign embassies in Kuwait be closed is totally unacceptable. Its use of foreign citizens as bombing shields is an abhorrent breach of basic human principles. Those committing these heinous acts will be held personally responsible and must be brought to justice in accordance with international law. The increasing violence and pillage by the occupying forces in Kuwait represent barbaric sets that must be condemned by the world community.The world community faced Iraqi's aggression with determination and unanimity. For the first time the Security Council - acting under Chapter VII of the Charter - decided on far-reaching mandatory sanctions against an aggressor. Security Council resolution 661 (1990) and  not least  resolution 665 (1990) on the enforcement of the mandatory sanctions represent hallmarks in the history of the United Nations  and just half an hour ago  as we sat in this Hall  the Security Council again lived up to its responsibilities.Denmark firmly believes in the need for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Gulf  This requires the full use of all the instruments of the United Nations  embodied in the Charter  and contributions from all members of the world community.The mandatory sanctions must be made as effective as at all possible and must be enforced rigorously. To ensure a broadly based international effort  Denmark  for its part  has decided to send a naval vessel to the Gulf to participate in the enforcement of the mandatory sanctions in accordance with resolution 665 (1990). We feel that the United Nations must play as central a role as possible in the co-ordination of the multinational efforts to ensure strict implementation of the sanctions. This would strengthen the Organisation's position in respect of future conflicts and would bring us closer to the establishment of the collective security system envisaged by its founding fathers.At the same time  we must not forget the grave humanitarian problems caused by Iraq's aggression. Denmark  like many other nations  has already contributed to alleviation of the plight of the countless refugees. But more must be done. And we must strengthen the abilities of the United Nations system in this respect as well.Nothing short of the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the re-establishment of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait will be acceptable. We must demonstrate clearly  once and for all  that aggression will never pay· Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait represent a blemish on an otherwise positive political situation in the world at large.When historians look back on this century they will no doubt regard the year 1990 as the most important in the post-war period. And they will probably focus on the tremendous changes in Europe  on the closing chapters of what used to be called the cold war.Developments in Europe have given new hope to millions of people around the globe. Past confrontations have been replaced by co-operation. The divisive wall through Europe has literally crumbled. In Eastern and Central Europe freedom and democracy are rapidly emerging. Pluralistic political systems and free market economies are being developed with vigour and enthusiasm.The most prominent expression of the new era is the unification of Germany  A unified Germany will  in a few days  take its proper place in our world Organisation. And in Europe  Germany will play its role in the context of the European Community  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (HATO) and other multilateral organizations. We congratulate the German people on their achievement.New structures are emerging in Europe. A dynamic European Community continues on its path towards closer political and economic co-operation. It does so with unreserved openness towards other countries  with a firm determination to live up to its responsibility and make its contribution to a stronger and more democratic Europe  and with a wish to give practical expression to its political and economic support for the budding democracies in East and Central Europe.The dramatic events in Europe expressed the will of the ordinary citizens. It was the people who made the revolution. But all this had not been possible without the courage and foresight demonstrated by President Mikhail Gorbachev  or without the new partnership between the United States and the Soviet Union. One of the very positive results of President Gorbachev's reforms has been the free elections this spring in the three Baltic republics - Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania. Only a tragic history has prevented the Baltic peoples from taking their place among the free nations of Europe. They should be here today  and one they will be. The three Baltic republics were members of the League of Nations as independent States for some 20 years. Denmark recognised the Baltic republics in 1921 and never accepted their forced incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940. We support their efforts to give real substance to their formal independence. We hope that before long they will be allowed to shoulder their responsibility as full-fledged participants in international co-operation. We realize that difficult problems will have to be solved in negotiations with the Soviet Union. We appeal to the parties concerned to show flexibility and goodwill in this endeavour.A firm foundation has already been laid for a future Europe living in peace  freedom and democracy. Major contributions have been made within the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). At the second meeting  in Copenhagen in June  of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE Process the CSCE States adopted a historic document - a freedom charter  containing basic principles for the development of pluralistic democracies based on respect for human rights  including free elections  freedom of expression and the free political choice of the individual.The CSCE process has other important dimensions  however. It has the potential to be a key element in a new European structure  bridging the old divide in Europe and enhancing security and co-operation on our continent. We are confident that the summit meeting of the CSCE States in Paris this autumn will advance that goal significantly. We are convinced that the coming transformation of the CSCE will also enable the participating States to make a better contribution to world peace and security. And we trust that the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the CSCE countries here in New York early next week will contribute to the further development of the CSCE process.There will be no peaceful world without disarmament on a world-wide scale - disarmament covering all categories of weapons: nuclear  conventional and chemical. We are encouraged by the progress made in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic nuclear forces. The possibility of signing a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the end of the year seems within reach.Optimism seems justified in the field of conventional disarmament also. We hope that a conventional forces in Europe treaty will be ready for signature at a CSCE summit in November. We attach great importance to the world-wide handling of conventional disarmament that takes place in the United Nations.Events in the Gulf have once more emphasized the urgent need for a global convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons  and the necessity to avoid a further spread of nuclear weapons. It is our hope that the complete test of a convention on chemical weapons can be submitted in the near future. Even if the recent Review Conference in Geneva on the Non-Proliferation Treaty failed to produce a final document  we feel that the conference was useful and  on the whole  strengthened the Treaty.Now let me turn briefly to some of the regional conflicts.It is a further injustice to the Arab peoples that Iraq's aggression against Kuwait has delayed the search for progress towards solutions to other problems in the Middle East - the Arab-Israeli conflict  the Palestinian problem  and the situation in Lebanon. These problems must not be forgotten. We must continue the search for just  comprehensive and lasting solutions. In view of the alarming situation in the occupied territories  it is essential to bring about a genuine Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as soon as possible. The agreement between Iran and Iraq on the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1989) is to be applauded.Developments in South Africa have been very positive. The meetings between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and President De Klerk's Government  which resulted in the Groote Schur Minutes and the Pretoria Agreement  represent major achievements. Real negotiations about a future non-racial and democratic South Africa are within reach.We urge all South Africans to work together to end the violence that could threaten the road to the complete abolition of apartheid. Lasting changes in South Africa can be achieved only by negotiations and by peaceful means. The United Nations should continue to send a clear and unanimous signal to this end. The consensus resolution adopted at the resumed special session on apartheid last week was encouraging. We hope that this session of the General Assembly will support that achievement with a balanced voice in favour of an urgent  peaceful solution to the complex problems of South Africa.In Cambodia  a solution appears to be imminent. We commend the five permanent members of the Security Council for the results achieved in establishing a framework for a comprehensive political solution. We note with satisfaction that the Cambodian parties have agreed to this framework  and we are very encouraged by the formation of the Supreme National Council. All parties involved should now concentrate their efforts on the implementation of the agreements. We strongly support the role of the United Nations in this process. The successful United Nations operation in Namibia has added new dimensions to the possibilities of the world Organisation. This augurs well for the potential new tasks in  inter alia Cambodia and Western Sahara. The Namibia operation has also reaffirmed the fundamental importance of the peace-keeping activities of the United NationsDenmark remains a firm supporter of United Nations peace-keeping operations. They must be based on efficiency  cost-effectiveness and flexibility. This is the yardstick we shall continue to use when reviewing our contributions - present and future - to the peace-keeping efforts of the Organization. We should like to see the peace-keeping role of the United Nations strengthened even further  and the possibilities of expanding it in the area of peace-making should be looked into. All peace-keeping and peace-making operations should have a clear mandate  the full co-operation of the parties involved  and a sound financial basis. All member countries must recognize their responsibility for the financing of peace-keeping operations  and they must show willingness to live up to their responsibilities.A solution to the general financial problems of the United Nations is equally important. All member countries should pay their assessed contributions promptly and in full. Only if this prerequisite is fulfilled can the United Nations meet the enormous challenges of the years to come. The founders did not limit their vision to the solution of political problems; they envisaged a world where all people had the right to a decent life. We must not forget our common responsibility for improving living conditions in the developing world. The problems of the developing countries are still immense. More than one billion people are still living in poverty. The situation in many of the least developed countries has deteriorated over the past 20 years. We must all  rich and poor  realize that economic growth and development can he successfully achieved only if the development process is broad-based. That was the clear message from the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris earlier this month.Governments must be held accountable for their actions. People must be allowed to participate in the political process. Democracy  pluralism and respect for human rights are indispensable features of sustainable development. It is encouraging that political and legal reforms are on the agenda in an increasing number of countries. Denmark welcomes that development. It gives reason for optimism. Human rights  democratization and popular participation in the development process are both important tools and objectives in Danish development co-operation. The international development agencies  increasingly  are following the path. We  for our part  will support this trend. Human rights and democratization are not to be seen as temporary items on the development agenda. It is our common responsibility to make sure they have come to stay.By doing so we might also contribute to solving the overwhelming problem of refugees. Unless tackled in a comprehensive context  that immense problem could endanger our security in the foreseeable future.At the same time  we must not lose sight of other threats to developing and developed countries alike.Climate changes  our exploitation of the Earth's resources and pollution of the seas represent fundamental threats to social and economic development. International co-operation and concrete action are needed. The United Nations should continue to give high priority to environmental issues. The first session of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development augured well for the future. The greatest challenge will be to find ways and means to enable the developing countries to participate in international environmental co-operation and to integrate an environmental dimension into their own development policies and programmes  h comprehensive approach is necessary. It must include the transfer of environmentally sound technology and additional financial resources.The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls for effective action to counteract climate change. Negotiations on a convention on climate change should be initiated as soon as possible  and the convention should be ready for signature at the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development.Other challenges must be met with equal vigour. The fight against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs must build on the momentum created by this year's special session of this General Assembly. The outcome of the special session on combating narcotic drugs last February laid a new foundation for the fight against this evil.Drugs and terrorism are closely related. But international terrorism has other sources too. The crisis in the Gulf has added fuel to the use of terrorism for political ends. The world community must never accept the use of terrorism. All nations must work closely together to prevent the perpetrators of terrorism from committing their brutal and senseless acts.Today we have unprecedented opportunities to fulfil the obligations set out in the Charter of the United Nations. We must seize these opportunities. We must utilise Charter provisions to establish a system of collective security. We must demonstrate in deeds that military aggression will never be tolerated and never rewarded. We must make full use of the peace-keeping and peace-making role of the Organisation. We must establish an international community based on the rule of law  where conflicting interests are settled by peaceful means and based on democratic processes  political pluralism and respect for human rights and freedom of expression.	We must assist the less-favoured nations in solving their enormous problems of development. We must combat the threats to the environment and the evils of narcotic drugs and international terrorism. We must practise tolerance and counter anti-Semitism  racism and practices based on hatred. And we must do so in a world Organization that is truly universal. Together we must help realize the vision of the founders  not for their sake  but for ourselves  for our children and for all future generations."
"44",1999,"DOM",45,1990,"﻿I should like my words to this Assembly  to which are brought such important problems and thorny situations  to be a fervent message of the faith and hope of the Dominican Government  a message brought from the heart of the land where the first institutions were established after the discovery of America and the meeting of races and cultures.On behalf of the Dominican Republic  I wish most sincerely to congratulateMr. Guido de Marco on his having been elected President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. In conferring on him such an outstanding honour  the Organisation has recognised his outstanding diplomatic work and his devotion to the cause of peace.He also wish to congratulate the President of the forty-fourth session  the Ambassador of Nigeria  Major General Joseph Garba  on the excellent work he did and on the wisdom and discretion with which he overcame innumerable obstacles.We reiterate our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  who has spared no efforts in the cause of world peace. He has even made several trips to that region of anguish the Middle East  and has established valuable personal contacts with the aim of finding a negotiated solution to the crisis that affects that region  in particular the Persian Gulf.We wish to place on record the great pleasure of the Dominican Republic at the admission of Namibia to the Organisation. That country should have taken its seat here long ago  but finally its admission has become a reality.It is with great pleasure that we associate ourselves with the expressions of solidarity made here following the admission of the State of Liechtenstein. It has been welcomed with much pleasure as a member of this family of nations  which has thus come nearer to universality. At this crucial moment in contemporary history it is an imperative need for the Organisation to carry out its sacred mission of safeguarding peace at all costs. Scarcely five years ago tensions between the nuclear Powers were growing more acute  and the arms race had accelerated greatly and represented a terrible danger to human existence. The talks and the agreements on the elimination of short- and medium-range missiles prove that with political will peace can be maintained.The unexpected and brutal invasion of Kuwait by Iraq  which overthrew its legitimate Government and violated the sovereignty of a virtually helpless nation  has been condemned by the whole international community. Such is the enormity of this violation perpetrated at all levels by the reckless Iraqi leader  on whom all eyes are fixed in horror  that we cannot foresee the future course of these events.The Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  in his introductory statement to the forty-fifth session  indicated his concern over the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the resultant danger of a vast conflagration. The Dominican Republic  as an active member of the community of nations  fully supports the terms and substance of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council in view of this grave violation  this armed attack that has usurped the sovereignty of a State  and invokes the inherent right of self-defence as the necessary response of the international community in the face of this gross and unprecedented annexation.Turning now to my country  the President of the Republic  Dr. Joaquin Balaguer  after being re-elected in May and assuming office in mid-August this year  has been striving to carry out the arduous task of the modernisation of our State at all levels  executing a plan of economic adjustment and national consultation among labour  management and the general public  which should end with the establishment of our economy on a sound basis. Nevertheless  our country  like other developing countries  is facing the serious problem of external debt  aggravated by the persistently low prices of our export commodities. The debt is a heavy burden that hinders our growth and development. Reforms of economic policy and structural adjustment that we have carried out cannot be fully effective unless the developed countries adopt measures to alleviate this insupportable burden of debt. In this regard we greatly welcome the initiative of President Bush to grant partial forgiveness of the concessional debt and we urge creditor countries to implement similar programmes to reduce or cancel debt through official assistance  since now that the debt has become un-payable it has turned into a problem that can only be dealt with through international co-operation.I should indicate that the Read of the Dominican State has achieved the best results in his policy of providing the country with the infrastructure it requires for its growth and subsequent development. Here we should mention the construction of housing  hospitals  sports facilities  schools  local road networks  aqueducts and dams. His Government enjoys general recognition and gratitude for the striking results of the creation of new free trade zones in different areas of our country. Re is also credited with being the real initiator and main driving force of tourism and the growing development of the tourist infrastructure of our country.This vast work of national renewal has been made possible thanks to the climate of democracy  confidence and security prevailing in our country and thanks to the absolute respect of the Government for the free exercise of human rights  from the main human right  the right to life  to unrestricted freedom of expression and thought. In this way the noble principles enshrined in the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Hunan Rights and in international covenants on the subject are being translated into reality. Any foreigner coating to the Dominican Republic can see the reality of a proverbially hospitable nation that enjoys peace  quiet and order under the total protection of its competent authorities.We have always been opposed to any form of racial discrimination because such discrimination constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights. So it is a subject of justified pleasure to see how the South African President Frederik De Klerk  is becoming reconciled to this view and how he has admitted to the press the possibility of candidates of any race having the right to vote. That presages the beginning of the process that will finally lead to the elimination of the hated system of apartheid. Any act of discrimination regardless of its form and regardless of the person or entity it is directed against  is to be censured and is contrary to morality and law. In the light of this reflection  the delegation of the Dominican Republic believes that the resolution which equated Zionism with racism is in and of itself an act of discrimination  and thus we feel that it should be repealed.The unification of the Korean peninsula is a subject of the greatest concern to the international community. The Dominican Republic expresses its pleasure at the advances made by the communities of South Korea and North Korea in the areas of economic co-operation and cultural exchange as part of the process of rapprochement  which  on the basis of dialogue and negotiation between the two sides  could lead to the reunification of Korea. Accordingly  until the achievement of that unity  we would favour the admission of South Korea to the United Nations.The reunification of Germany  an event of such extraordinary importance that it does not need to be emphasised here  constitutes a veritable milestone in the history of the United Nations. It represents the most outstanding case of integration and national reconciliation in the post-war period. It shows how much can be accomplished by fraternity and solidarity  and it is the most striking example of integration in this new era of changes and opportunities that can lead to a better future for mankind.Aware of the extremely serious problem of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking  the Dominican Government is implementing severe measures to combat that scourge which so cruelly afflicts mankind. Our authorities are waging active campaigns for the prevention of drug abuse  while taking vigorous administrative  judicial and legislative action against the production  use and marketing of and illicit trafficking in drugs.I feel it is appropriate here to turn to a subject that is of great interest today the process of transition to a democratic pattern that has been going on for some time now in the Republic of Haiti. On this subject the Dominican delegation expresses its satisfaction at the encouraging progress made in the preparations for the holding of presidential elections that will soon take place in that country. The Dominican Republic therefore favours the provision of assistance by the United Nations in the form of observers appointed by our Organisation to assist the Haitian nation during the elections.By an accident of fate the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the same island and have known similar vicissitudes on their respective paths towards independence and sovereignty  and therefore we are most interested in seeing our sister nation achieve stability. But our country's fundamental interest is not limited to that aspect; it also concerns Haiti's political and economic development.Haiti needs the support of the entire international community  since until we  the nations of this hemisphere  have thus far confined ourselves to pointing out the problems without striving to find the right solutions to them  for that reason  we feel it is time to discuss  this delicate situation before the Assembly. Its scope is more than national  even than regional  and it has become a question that deserves the attention of the international community.The Dominican Republic  familiar with the problems of our neighbour country and aware of its own historic responsibilities  has found it necessary to receive a constant flow of Haitian immigrants  numbering more than 1 million  who are competing freely with the Dominican labour force. Our country accepted this immigration since one of the cardinal principles of its foreign policy is to regard solidarity as the highest elevated expression of human conscience. Thus Haitian nationals also enjoy the same benefits and prerogatives and Dominicans  in an atmosphere of security and respect without discrimination of any kind.Lastly  we are particularly pleased to state that as the obstacles to the full rehabilitation of Haiti are gradually overcome  opportunities for greater co-operation between our two countries will increase and we shall march together towards the achievements of our most cherished ideals and our highest national aspirations.In conclusion  I should like to stress our conviction that the United Nations is the authentic custodian that will preserve the inestimable treasure of the lofty values extolled at the dawn of a new era of harmony and peace. This bright awakening of the universal conscience reflects the emergence of an era based on the high principles enshrined in the Charter of this noble institution  the nurturing source of all the hopes and desires of Mankind."
"45",2046,"DZA",45,1990,"﻿It gives the Algerian delegation great satisfaction to see you  Sir  presiding over the work of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. In electing you to the presidency  the Assembly paid a well deserved tribute to your well-known personal and professional qualities and to Malta  with which Algeria has long enjoyed relations of friendship  understanding and co-operation. As I convey to you our warm congratulations  I wish to assure you of the friendly and complete co-operation of the Algerian delegation.Our congratulations and fraternal greetings go also to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria. The ability  wisdom and devotion he displayed during his term deserve our gratitude. It is always a pleasant duty for my delegation to reiterate its gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts that so perfectly embody the commitment of the United Nations and its irreplaceable service to peace and development.The people of Yemen are now represented in this Assembly by a single delegation. Algeria is proud  joyful and satisfied at this  and we reiterate our warm good wishes to that fraternal people which is now reunified. We also welcome among us the delegation of Liechtenstein  which we congratulate on its admission to membership of the United Nations. The great transformations which have been taking place on the international scene and the resultant clean break with the cold war  herald the emergence of a new political order. New joint action and co-operation signal the end to earlier antagonisms between the two super-Powers. It is only fair to recognize that this has already had positive effects  if only because it has paved the way to the resolution of certain regional conflicts  consolidated the process of disarmament and affirmed the promotion of co-operation and security in Europe  making it possible in the heart of that continent for the peaceful reunification of Germany.In that connection  Algeria conveys its warmest wishes to the German people  which is about to celebrate its unity  tie also express the hope that a reunified Germany will use its economic and political power to strengthen world peace and security and to bolster international solidarity and economic co-operation.While it is only fair to acknowledge the potential benefits of all these developments  it would do no harm to point out that by and large they have affected only one part of the planet: In the other part  the South  all we see is the persistence  even the deterioration  of negative situations. There is an increasing contrast between the new prospects opening towards greater security   freedom and well-being on the one hand  and ever-increasing injustice  violence and underdevelopment on the other. This indicates the magnitude of the challenges involved in establishing a new political order that can respond to the fundamental needs of all mankind.There is not a more telling illustration of the magnitude of the challenge than the tragedy of the Palestinian people. International law has been constantly flouted in the Middle East  the repression o£ the Palestinian people and its intifadah is daily growing more systematic  harsher and more inhuman; the rejection of peace has grown more obdurate and  through the arrangement of mass emigration of European Jewish citizens to the occupied territories  Israel's expansionist option is more than ever openly avowed.It was in the midst of this clear deterioration of the situation in the region that the Gulf crisis burst upon us with its attendant grave dangers for the entire Arab world and the threats it poses to international peace and security. For Algeria  this crisis is a new and deep wound in its flesh. We abhor the use of force to settle disputes  particularly since  in this case  the rift is having the double effect of casting the fraternal people of Kuwait into total distress and of exposing another fraternal country  Iraq  to being weakened or even potential destruction. Both those effects are equally unacceptable. We must also consider all the foreign workers living in those two sister countries  who face the horror of destitution and exile and the anguish of an uncertain future.When the crisis broke out  Algeria made very clear its commitment to international legality  the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the norms and principles of international law  and firmly advocated a negotiated Arab solution free from any direct or indirect foreign pressure or interference. My country also noted that the responsibilities of States and of the international community in this crisis must be aimed above all at the victory of reason over any logic of war  particularly since the direct involvement of foreign forces in the region on an unprecedented scale would likely exacerbate confrontation  a development that is bound to have a serious effect on the peoples and countries of the region  and the international community which will not escape its effect.That is why we believe it is essential for the parties involved to display the greatest possible restraint in order to make possible the search for a solution by all appropriate political and diplomatic means.Since the United Nations was founded to save mankind from the scourge of war and not to contribute in any way to creating new suffering  recourse to Chapter VII of the Charter must not give rise to any doubts and must result from a faithful interpretation of the spirit and the letter of all the provisions of the Charter. In that connection  Algeria has drawn attention to the danger that concern only with the effectiveness of economic sanctions  which will starve the Iraqi and Kuwaiti peoples  could ultimately clash with the international law of humanity. It must be recognised today that the international community has all too often let flagrant violations of international law go unpunished. In the Middle East in particular  Israel's occupation of Arab territories since 1967 and its subsequent annexation of the Golan and El Quds  followed by its repeated invasions of Lebanon and occupation of the southern part of that country  as well as its repeated aggression against Tunisia in 1986 and 1988  the air raid against Iraq in 1981 and finally its systematic suppression of the Palestinian intifadah have all been the subjects of United Nations resolutions that Israel has rejected out of hand and openly flouted.Therefore  it is our profound hope and urgent appeal that  in order to promote an unequivocal consensus on the Gulf crisis  the Security Council will display the sane commitment  determination and unity of action to ensure the full and strict implementation of the pertinent United Nations decisions  so as to bring about a just and comprehensive solution that would put a definitive end to the conflict in the Middle East and restore to the Palestinian people all their legitimate rights  including their right to their own independent State.Towards that end  the appropriate framework will be the international conference on peace in the Middle East  on which there is broad unanimity  especially with regard to the essential participation on an equal footing of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PŁO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.Similarly  it is our hope that the Security Council will bring to bear its full authority to put an end to the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and thus enable the legitimate Government of Lebanon to exercise full sovereignty over its entire territory.In close co-operation with the two other members of the High Arab Tripartite Committee  Algeria will continue to work relentlessly to restore a unified  sovereign  peaceful and prosperous Lebanon. We very much welcome the fact that the Lebanese Parliament has adopted constitutional reforms  and we would like to congratulate the legitimate Government and institutions of Lebanon on this progress towards national consensus.Finally  we would appeal for international support for the setting up of an international assistance fund to Lebanon  as recently decided.Pursuant to Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and on the basis of the Algiers Agreements of 1975  Iraq and Iran have taken the initiative of settling all aspects of their dispute  thus putting an end  after the cessation of hostilities to a long period of truce that could not  however  be called peace. Because Algiers spared no effort in working for that happy outcome  Algeria finds cause for self-congratulation in the fact that those two Muslim countries have embarked on the path of lasting peace and understanding  which is the only way towards friendship and co-operation between their two peoples. It is Algeria's hope that a peaceful solution of the current crisis will be an incentive to all the Gulf States to embark on the same path and thus restore the trust and co-operation which will free the Gulf and its States from foreign interference.The reaction of the Arab peoples to the Gulf crisis is closely linked to the discriminatory handling of the violations of international law that have been committed with impunity in the region. This has convinced the Arab peoples that the international community applies a double standard  which very naturally nurtures a profound feeling of injustice. It is equally clear that that reaction also reflects strong aspirations after inter-Arab solidarity  that would rise to the level of the profound attachment of the Arab peoples to the Arab nation  a solidarity that is so essential if we are to eliminate all divisive factors which tend to weaken the ability of Arabs to take charge of their common destiny. It is because they share that conviction that the countries of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)  which recently met under the presidency of President Chadli Bendjedid  are constantly striving to consolidate the march towards unity upon which they have embarked.Within the framework of permanent machinery for concerted and co-ordinated action to achieve common goals  specific and concrete actions strengthen at every stage a process that is in full accord with the requirements of the times and which is further carried forward by the irresistible will of the peoples of the region  whom a common cultural heritage naturally prompts to base their hopes for development and prosperity on their striving for unity.The meeting in Algiers last June of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned Mediterranean countries - the third after La Valette and Brioni - proved to be extremely timely in view of the need to evaluate in common the new facts of the international  economic  and political situation and its impact on the Mediterranean non-aligned countries.In that connection  the Conference considered ways and means of intensifying dialogue and co-operation with their partners in the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe with a view to meeting the legitimate concerns of the European Economic Community Mediterranean Countries  widening the scope of consultation between the two sides of the Mediterranean and setting up an institutionalised framework for such consultation.Much has happened in Europe that is now actively paving the way towards a new economic and security situation in that continent. It is the hope and resolve of our countries that the Mediterranean dimension  which has been marginalized in recent times  will assume its fu3I historic importance in the light of the common challenge of security and development  which should be established and strengthened to the advantage of all the coastal States if they are to be realized. In more ways than one  1990 could be called the year of the United Nations. In Namibia  the United Nations amply demonstrated its great ability to implement the independence plan it had conceived. In South Africa  it has gone every step of the way in the struggle of the South African people to restore their inalienable rights in a unified and democratic society. The legalization of political struggle in South Africa and the initiation of a long-awaited dialogue that would truly dismantle apartheid are the results of international pressure. Therefore  it is essential to be vigilant when we see that divisive and diversionary tactics as well as repression still pose a threat to those objectives.The United Nations stand on the side of the collective African will already bears fruit and gives us every reason to hope that a solution will soon be found to the problem of Western Sahara. The joint good offices of the current president of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations  which as recently as August 1988 led to the presentation of peace proposals acceptable to both parties to the conflict - the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front - have resulted  last June  in the drawing up of a genuine settlement plan which was subsequently endorsed by Security Council resolution 658 (1990).Algeria welcomes this crucial stage in the process which aims at the organization and supervision by the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity  of a referendum on self-determination for the people of the Western Sahara without any administrative or military constraints.My country wishes to reiterate its tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to the current president of the OAU for their efforts in that context. They know that they can count on Algeria's full support and co-operation in their efforts to finalize the settlement plan and to ensure its impartial implementation. National reconciliation processes supported by international dialogue and encouraged by the United Nations with a view to reaching peaceful settlement of certain regional conflicts are designed to serve the same goal - namely  to facilitate and support the free choice by peoples of their leaders  their economic and social systems  and their institutions as well as to preserve the sovereignty  independence  unity and very often - as in the case of Afghanistan  Cambodia and Cyprus - the non-aligned status of such countries. This also applies to the Korean peninsula  where the meeting between the two Prime Ministers of those two Governments represents progress towards the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is progress that Algeria welcomes and encourages.While the integration of the Eastern countries into the world economy has from the outset aroused resolute support on the part of the international community  since it provides fresh prospects for greater prosperity in the North  the simultaneous deterioration of the economic situation in the developing countries and the tragic widening of the North-South gap bear witness to the aggravation of the imbalances created by the international economic system.The spread of poverty  which has been further exacerbated by the harshness of structural adjustment programmes  external indebtedness  deterioration in the terms of trade  and malfunctions in the international trade and monetary systems  have all demonstrated that international co-operation in the area of development remains outside the ambit of the renewals now so characteristic of international political relations.In this  the United Nations system has a major role to play  in view of the intimate link between peace and development. The revitalisation of growth of the developing countries was defined by the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly last April as the most important challenge of the l990s. It is important that the consensus that emerged on that occasion in favour of a Declaration on international economic co-operation should take a concrete form that would be commensurate with the commitment to enable international co-operation to rise to the challenge of development. Similarly  the programme of action in favour of the least developed countries which was recently adopted in Paris deserves even more determined support from the international community to put an end to economic regression and to lay the foundations of economic development in those particularly vulnerable countries  More generally speaking  the resuscitation of the North-South dialogue is a necessary target if we are to promote international economic relations that are fairer and more equitable. South-South co-operation is a fundamental principle of Algeria's policies. We are convinced that promoting varied trade between the countries of the South is a very promising dimension in international economic relations and a vital necessity if the developing countries wish to rise to the status of full-fledged partners in a world that is undergoing fundamental changes.In this context  the creation of a summit consultative group on South-South co-operation  whose first summit was held in Kuala Lumpur in June 1990  is likely to give concrete meaning and decisive political thrust to South-South co-operation.The report of the South Commission with respect to international co-operation in general and South-South co-operation in particular must be viewed as a valuable contribution. It is based on innovative thinking and advocates a fruitful approach and realistic steps which we owe it to ourselves to take into account both individually and collectively. I should like here to pay a fraternal tribute to a great man and worthy son of Africa  Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  as well as to the entire membership of the South Commission over which he presides. Any new outlook in international relations should be a reflection of the international will and should be based  therefore  on the contributions of all States in a context of co-equality regardless of their international weight  their level of economic development or their military might. This means that if the United Nations is to be an impartial tool of the collective will and collective action  it must constantly ensure respect for the rules of objectivity and equality of treatment. The United Nations is the very embodiment of all the best that humanity desires for itself. The vision that the United Nations has of the world cannot therefore be identified with that held by any particular State or group of States. Transcending strategies and interests defined in terms of restricted economic circles and exclusive military clubs  it is rather by merging individual advantage and common cause that this noble work can be accomplished.That vision demands a great deal of the Members of our Organization  particularly of those who have power and prosperity in their favour. It requires that they be exemplary in their behaviour in the international arena. In effect  their individual and collective contributions will be decisive in strengthening international peace and security and bringing about the international economic co-operation that would promote sound development.Hence in the world will be much more effectively guaranteed if economic development is more widely shared. It is our profound hope that the United Nations will work to provide humanity with what may prove to be its most valuable asset. "
"46",2093,"ECU",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  all of us in Ecuador feel profound friendship and great admiration for your country. I should like to express these feelings as I hail you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session and to wish you every success.Today  as in the past  the world needs to strengthen the United Nations. Today  more than in the past  the international community must be governed by the postulates enshrined in the Charter and must build a new era of peace  security  development and democracy.Ecuador wishes to bear witness once again to its faith in the United Nations and to its abiding and renewed dedication to all the principles of international law and justice which the Organisation has been strengthening. Those very same principles are embodied in the political Constitution of my country and guide the foreign policy of ray Government.Our tribute to the United Nations is a recognition of its noble spirit and of the constructive work it has steadfastly been carrying out  which gives expression to the world's hopes for a better future. The world we seek will have to strengthen world-wide solidarity and create the necessary framework for fruitful fellowship and co-operation at the international level. It will also have to respect the essential values of the human being. The so-called social contract  the formation of groups and societies  the very make-up of a State and of international organisations have a fundamental purpose  which is their rationale. That purpose is nothing more or less than facilitating solutions to common problems and making it possible to meet the legitimate aspirations of human beings. The recognition of the rights and obligations proper to a society thus conceived is the underpinning of democracy.Day after day the world is growing more interdependent  and it will have to develop greater solidarity. Solidarity is becoming manifest as a sine qua non for our common essence as human beings. We inhabit the same planet. Our future destiny is the sane. As a Roman sage put it  we are human  and nothing human can be alien to us.Since last year  mankind has been living through a time of expectation and hope. Changes have unfolded in the world with dizzying speed  changes of such magnitude and depth that international relations must now be viewed through a prism totally different from what might have been appropriate during most of this century. The curtailing of the Berlin Wall is the most visible symbol of a process of transformation which has opened a new era in the ties between the major Powers and has led to the formation and consolidation of major economic groups with decisive influence on the world scene. Peoples are the major protagonists in these substantial transformations. Aware of their strength and their ability to decide their own destiny  sure of their rights and determined to demand that States should interpret those rights faithfully  the world's peoples are shaping the new modalities and institutions that they will freely adopt to pursue their tireless quest for happiness.The transformations that have been taking place are changing all the political  economic and strategic patterns. Constructive dialogue has been gaining in strength and progressing smoothly. It is marked by growing confidence and is feeding on its own dynamism  while bearing fruit in the form of positive actions that benefit all mankind. It is only right to pay a tribute to the vision and courage of all those who have led this process of international detente  especially the President of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev.We welcome the reunification of Germany  and in this step of far-reaching significance we see possibilities of enormous importance for the world economy and for the consolidation of Europe's efforts to encourage understanding and the global climate of détente. The universalisation of the United Nations as an ongoing process is also being extended to Korea  and the understandings moving forward there will have to reflect the orientations motivating the entire process.We have also seen during the year since the last session of the General Assembly  the triumph of the heroic and steadfast struggle of the noble people of Namibia  strengthened by the support of the world Organisation. The admission of Namibia to the United Nations as a new Member State gave particular and lasting significance to the process which constitutes a symbol in the successful fight against colonialism  discrimination and apartheid. Ecuador expresses the hope that the Measures adopted by the government of Mr. De Klerk regarding the granting of legitimacy to the African National Congress  the freeing of political leaders and other stops towards an opening of South Africa's political life have become part of a process which will lead at an early date to the total and complete disappearance of the apartheid regime. Against this background  we see the inspirational and visionary figure of that great leader  Nelson Mandela  to whom I  on behalf of Ecuador  wish to pay homage.Measures adopted by the Organisation in Central America have done much to facilitate the implementation of the Esquipulas and Telas Agreements. The electoral process in Nicaragua and the democratic transfer of power to a Government freely elected by the Nicaraguan people were very positive steps on the road to a peaceful settlement.Ecuador once again demonstrated its support for United Nations action  its solidarity with the Nicaraguan people and its constant commitment to finding a peaceful settlement to disputes when it participated with officers of its armed forces in the task entrusted to the United Nations Observer Group in Central America by the Security Council.We believe that the people of El Salvador must pursue their dialogue  which must be both flexible and realistic  in order to arrive at understandings between its political forces and thus to put an end to the crisis which has gone on for too many years and has claimed too many victims. We are closely following with similar concern the possibilities for overcoming confrontation in other countries of the region as well. Our readiness to co-operate towards that end has constantly been demonstrated in a practical way aimed at facilitating the kind of dialogue that will ultimately lead to negotiated solutions accepted by the parties now confronting each other. Accordingly  the government of Ecuador fraternally welcomed the meeting held in my country last week which led to working out certain basic guideline for reconciliation within Guatemala society. That meeting led to the adoption of the Quito Declaration within the context of a process of dialogue promoted by that country'· National Reconciliation Commission/ created within the context of the Esquipulas II Agreement. We believe that we must support any effort aimed at strengthening democracy  and for that reason we have also supported the request of the government of Haiti to have our Organisation co-operate in ensuring the proper conduct of the upcoming elections.The path towards overcoming all conflicts is  and indeed must b   the path of peaceful settlement. We are pleased  therefore  to note that the world Organisation has brought its influence to bear in order to bring about a settlement of the Cambodian conflict. We affirm with profound conviction that finding solutions to the Middle East conflict is a calling and an imperative for the United Nations. If it finds such solutions - as it has the historic obligation to do - its authority will be strengthened and will prove fundamental to peace in the years ahead.We see before us a world which must reorganise its international relations and adjust them to changing circumstances. The problems between countries are different from those that marked the East-West confrontation. The United Nations will have to pursue with renewed vigour its steadfast labour to promote and consolidate peace. The crisis in the Gulf demonstrates that the international community as a whole has faith in the ability of the Security Council to act. The Security Council  having regained the authority assigned to it by the Charter  has taken steps to ensure complete respect for the principles of the Organisation. I should like to reiterate here that Ecuador firmly supports all Security Council resolutions. We have also noted that at the Helsinki Summit detente between the major Powers is more than a matter of rhetoric and that the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed to adapt their positions and their actions to the pattern of solutions adopted by the United Nations.All this is to be welcomed as encouraging at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear that the world has other problems to contend with. There are forces that may create problems and tragically alter the trend towards peace that mankind wishes to pursue. The crisis of poverty  ignorance  enormous inequalities between rich and poor  the problems of the environment and drugs are all currently dangerous sources of conflict.If we succeed is halting the use of force between States  we shall have taken a major stride down the road towards peace. But in order to make peace and security effective  we must build international relations based upon an ethical order within a concept of harmony and solidarity that will open possibilities for the benefit and well-being of all. This means that we must put an end to economic and social underdevelopment and to environmental pollution; it means that we must view the problem of drugs as our own problem; it means that science and technology  financial resources and trade  the production of goods and services cannot be divorced from the legitimate aspirations of every member of the international community. Human solidarity cannot be limited to specific issues or kept within the confines of nations or regions. Security must be integral and universal. We must redefine the meaning and scope of peace and security  at the same time  we must strengthen the ability of our Organization to act. Mankind wants to live in a world of peace  freedom  social justice and total respect for human rights  in a world free of fear and distrust. This is not a dream world. It is a world which is within our reach if we can give to solidarity and interdependence the true meaning they must have and if  working together  we articulate a new concept of collective security that is more in keeping with the problems and risks that now confront us. The United Nations system as a whole will have to face reality and the new needs of mankind. We shall have to adopt measures that will enable that system to work with revised guidelines to combat the new types of violence that threaten international peace and security.This will be a complex  lengthy and delicate process which will have to be tackled with vision and courage  without undue haste but also without undue hesitation. Since its current Government came into office  Ecuador has tried to emphasise the implementation of the traditional principles of our international policy in the conviction that all countries  irrespective of size or economic or military power  can and must contribute to creating a world of progress and co-operation. Latin American countries have every reason to act as one  and we must continue to work towards that goal.The Presidents of the five countries members of the Andean Pact  meeting in the Galapagos islands  adopted agreements of great importance for galvanising subregional integration and laid the groundwork for a climate of peace  security and co-operation within a framework of understanding and good-neighbourliness  which will facilitate the elimination of all the problems hindering the process and their relations. The Galapagos presidential meeting and the subsequent one held at Machu Picchu enabled the Governments of the Andean Pact to establish closer ties of trust based on absolute mutual respect; this will permit more effective handling of the issues of Greatest urgency  importance and interest to them.In that spirit  for the first time in 170 years of history as a republic  a Peruvian President visited Ecuador and an Ecuadorian President visited Peru. Each was received with the respect and cordiality commensurate with our common determination to make our bilateral relations ever more fruitful. These mutual visits will unquestionably contribute to an environment in which we can take every opportunity offered by our proximity and in which we can overcome the differences that divide us. That is what President Rodrigo Borja said against the historic backdrop of Machu Picchu  and what I reaffirmed in this year's report on foreign relations.Latin America continues to suffer the effects of the most serious crisis in its history  but it has continued to strengthen its democracy notwithstanding the threats to social stability. We possess major human and natural resources and can therefore make a significant contribution to solving international problems. Overcoming the crisis will therefore be vital for the region and beneficial for the rest of the world.In these circumstances  President Bush's initiative for the Americas can and must give rise to a process of partnership based on mutual interest. Its elements are not based on paternalistic notions of direct economic aid  but are conceived rather in the context of necessary changes in international trade  international finance and investment. Those changes include: expanding trade and for that purpose lifting barriers  eliminating obstacles and paying better and fairer prices; reducing external debt and debt-servicing costs; and promoting investment. Implementing the initiative with dynamism and timeliness could make a significant contribution to resolving the region's most severe economic and social problems  to strengthening political stability and to establishing new relations in the hemisphere.Ecuador and Latin America as a whole reacted positively to the United States proposal. We must now work out the details and lay the groundwork for negotiations to identify problems and opportunities. President Bush has set out his proposal with vision and pragmatism. We in Latin America must  jointly and individually  define constructive responses that will enable us to find mutually beneficial paths. Ecuador reaffirms its views on the tragic problem of drugs. The results of the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly highlighted the shared responsibility of producers  traffickers  suppliers of ingredients and consumers. They also showed the variety and complexity of the social and economic conditions in countries that produce the raw materials for drugs. They made it clear that a comprehensive  joint approach is necessary to be successful in combating this scourge of mankind. Concerted action by all  and technical and financial support commensurate with each country's capacities and responsibilities  will enable us to adopt effective measures.Ecuador considers that protecting the environment is one of the issues that best highlights the interdependence of all States and that must move them to united action. The 1992 Conference on Environment and Development must be a milestone in human history. The preparations  guided with such dynamism and effectiveness by Maurice Strong  must continue to be detailed and specific. Agreements to be adopted must be specific and effective.Ecuador is privileged to serve at present as Secretary pro tempore of the Treaty for Amazonian Co-operation  which has eight signatory countries  at a time of two major events. First  a new phase in the Treaty is beginning  within the guidelines set by the Amazonian countries in their commitment to co-operation  with 50 programmes and more than 100 projects of the greatest importance related to the environment  science and technology  health  indigenous affairs  transportation and tourism  information and education. We note also that countries and institutions in general are assigning the highest priority to sustainable development efforts for the Amazon. Those two factors add up to a special situation  because countries are defining more clearly what they want to and must do in a sovereign way within their own territories  and the international community is ready to work on the basis of the terms  policies and strategies defined by the Amazon countries themselves.We are living in a world more aware of its problems and its possibilities. People the world over know what the facts are worldwide  and are better acquainted with the unjust gap that separates the excessively rich societies from the excessively poor societies. The United Nations  whose prestige is growing in pace with its effectiveness  faces the formidable challenge of contributing to strengthening positive trends in international relations  promoting efforts for a new dimension in independence and solidarity  and in that way enabling us to say as the twenty-first century begins  that we live in a batter world protected by a broader  more active and more realistic system of security that makes it possible for all - in industrialised countries and in the third world - to live together in peace and justice.

"47",2138,"EGY",45,1990,"﻿First of all  I would like to extend may delegation’s and my personal warmest congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of this important and vital session of the General Assembly. Without a doubt  his personal skills and experience  with which I am quite familiar because of our old friendship  will ensure the success of the work of this session and make it possible to attain the objectives and goals to which we aspire.I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Joseph Garba's important role as president of the General Assembly's forty-fourth session^I also wish to extend my country's congratulations to the people of Yemen on their historic atop of unifying. I also would like to congratulate the people and Government of Liechtenstein on its admission to the membership of our Organisation.The present session is convened at an historic juncture. The unification of the Germanys is a giant step -which may be viewed as one of the most important results of the ending of the cold war. We hope to witness in the near future the unification of the two Koreas  in the interests of the Korean people.One of the most significant aspects of this session  is that it is being held in the wake of the cold war's ending at a time when detente has begun to prevail in the international community with all that that means in terms of a positive outlook and the ability to respond to the aspirations of peoples and whole communities In the view of Egypt's delegation  the ending of the cold war is the most important landmark in international relations at the end of the twentieth century. While we welcome this  we in the third world cannot but feel somewhat apprehensive with regard to the increasing co-operation between East and West. We fear that this new co-operation nay be at the expense of the South. I am referring to the dangers of the so-called marginalisation of the South. This is a tendency that the developed countries should avoid. On the other hand  the developing countries should be wary of it.None the less  there has been a recent important gain that has profound implications  which I must emphasise here namely  the strengthening of the United Nations and the enhanced credibility of its role. There is no doubt that this forty-fifth session now takes place at a time when the international Organization has enhanced its status and increased its effectiveness. I believe that this will enable the third world countries to play a more effective role in conducting the affairs of the United Nations in favour of an international peace and world security system that would be based on justice and fairness.If the United Nations has demonstrated recently its focal role in imposing the adherence to the principles of the Charter and the need to resolve international problems by peaceful means  we are all required to ensure that the Organisation should continue to play that focal role by showing our solidarity as a world community in standing up to each and every aggression  expansion and violation of the sovereignty and legitimacy of any State Member of the United Nations.Moreover  the ending of the cold war necessarily will mean significant progress towards disarmament. This is the hop  of a humanity that yearns for peace  tranquillity and prosperity. It is also an objective that goes hand in hand with Egypt's constant striving to free the Middle East region from all weapons of mass destruction.Having spoken of aggression  expansion and the violation of the sovereignty and legitimacy of other States  I am duty-bound to speak of the tragic events which began on 2 August 1990  when the Iraqi array invaded the territory of Kuwait. That Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  the overthrow of its legitimate Government  called to mind a bitter period in the history of Europe that led to the outbreak of the Second World War.It was unfortunate indeed that by its invasion of Kuwait  Iraq should have seen fit to stem the tide of optimism and about the hope in a future wherein nations could look forward to conduct their dealings with each other in line with the dictates of international legitimacy. It did this at a time when the international community had begun to breathe easier and enjoy the first fruits of detente and the collapse of the symbols of ideological and political differences.The Iraqi occupation of Kuwait cones as a brutal and irrational attempt to vitiate and annul the patient and painstaking strivings by mankind for over half a century to enshrine the principles of legitimacy. It undermines the achievements of sanity and the success of the international will to return to the rule of law and the principles of the United Nations  Charter.Egypt  which prides itself on its participation in the drafting of the United Nations Charter its membership of the international Organisation since its inception and its hosting of the League of Arab States in line with the behests of its role and its commitments  cannot but declare from this rostrum - which represents the very pulse of an international community that is desirous of upholding international legitimacy and international law - Egypt  I repeat  cannot but renew its condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and reiterate its denunciation of the continuation of that occupation. Egypt repeats it  call for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from the State of Kuwait and the return of its legitimate Government in compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. The successive Security Council resolutions concerning the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait provide a good basis for the peaceful option in the settlement of this problem.When I speak of a peaceful option  I want to stress that the President  Government and people of Egypt want to avoid the consequences and implications of the military option. President Hosni Mubarak’s efforts towards a peaceful settlement of this crisis and his sincere appeal to the Iraqi leader to resort to reason and respond to international and regional unanimity in calling for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait  stem from Egypt's sincere desire to find a peaceful solution before it becomes too late and thus spare the region more bloodshed. It is enough that principles and values have been trampled underfoot.Egypt's position of principle in respect of the Gulf crisis is not only consonant with Security Council resolutions  but also bespeaks  quite clearly and altruistically  Egypt's historic and moral responsibilities towards the Arab world. Those responsibilities are not a matter of choice. Bather  they are a form of inescapable historic necessity.Given the deterioration of the situation and the heightening of tensions in the Gulf  we must never lose sight of another source of tension in the region  namely  Israel's continued occupation of the Arab lands and the increased suffering of the Arab people under that occupation. Israel would be mistaken if it believed that the Gulf crisis can divert attention from the Palestinian cause  from the intifadah of the Palestinian people or from that people's right to claim its inalienable political rights  especially its right to self-determination. Much as it is illogical to link Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and Israel's occupation of Arab lands  and much as it is wrong to make the settlement of the former issue conditional on the settlement of the latter Israel would miscalculate if it were to exploit the Gulf crisis in trying to blot out the Palestinian cause or sweep it into oblivion. We are firmly convinced that the inadmissibility of the acquisition of the lands of others by force is an indivisible principle.In order for things not to become confused  world public opinion must remain alert to Israel's practices in the occupied Arab territories! collective punishment  demolition of homes  arbitrary measures imposed on the occupied territories  the deportation by force of Palestinian women and their children and the continuing influx of immigrants from the Soviet Union Jews to Israel for settlement in the occupied Arab territories.It is with pleasure that I extend congratulations to the State of Namibia  which has joined the United Nations. Undoubtedly  this is a valuable addition to the Organisation's strength that consolidates its universal nature. With the independence of Namibia and its admission to the United Nations as a full member of the international community  the African continent has achieved a great advance towards complete liberation. There only remains the granting of the full rights of the militant people of South Africa and the dismantling of the apartheid system.In order to accelerate the tempo of accession to independence by the people of South Africa  I wish to call from this rostrum on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) to join racks and unite in their common struggle. We also hope that Nelson Mandela will be able to arrive at a shared position with Mr. Buthelesi towards an end to the violence  co-ordination of positions and the continuation of the liberation struggle.Notwithstanding certain signs of South Africa's march towards independence  the African continent still suffers from an unfavourable international economic situation  in addition to chronic economic problems and the results of natural disasters  such as drought and desertification.While Egypt welcomes the declared readiness of some developed countries to forgive some bilateral public debts owed by some African countries  especially the least developed among them  it hopes that further effective measures will be taken towards mitigating the burden of the African countries  foreign debts. That burden has been portrayed quite honestly and objectively in the report just referred to by the representative of Senegal which was prepared by Mr. Bettino Craxi  the Secretary-General's personal representative on the world debt problem.One of the urgent and just demands of the African countries is that the donor countries should adopt a more comprehensive strategy to deal with Africa's official and commercial indebtedness on a consistent basis  without discrimination or distinction between categories of debtor countries  while giving special attention to the needs of the least developed countries. It was on this basis that Egypt actively participated in the United Nations Conference on the problems of the least developed countries  which was held in Paris in September 1990. The serious economic problems besetting the third world under the impact of the accelerating international economic changes require  in our view  the intensification of dialogue and co-operation in the South-South contest  on the one hand  and between the South and the north  on the other. It was on this basis that the joint initiative by the Heads of State and Government of Egypt  Yugoslavia  Venezuela  Senegal and India was taken  with a view to reactivating dialogue between the North and the South on development issues. The initiative commanded the support of the Ninth Summit of Non-Aligned Countries which was held in Belgrade in September of 1989.That effort coincided with the initiative of the Group of 15 which was established at the Belgrade Summit of the Hon-Aligned Countries in order to reactivate South-South co-operation.Believing as it does in the importance of strengthening South-South co-operation  Egypt participated in the Summit of the 15 developing countries which was held in Kuala Lumpur in June 1990. That Summit adopted a new strategy. The summit of the same group which is to be held in Caracas in June 1991 will follow up the implementation of that strategy.In all its actions  Egypt works towards a just peace and the creation of opportunities that would strengthen that peace wherever possible. In effect  the striving for a just peace has always characterised Egypt's policy through the ages. The present phase is no exception. Peace that is based on justice provides the only solid foundation on which we can build the hopes and aspirations of mankind and translate them into realities.We in Egypt  much as we are surrounded by tensions  anxieties and feelings of injustice and insecurity  hold fast to those hopes and aspirations. The radical changes now taking place in the world have revived the dream of an age of peace as foreseen by the Arab philosopher  Al-Parabi  in his utopia. These radical changes that have been taking place over the past few years and which have now culminated in the lifting of the iron curtain between East and West augur well for all.However  Egypt notes with concern the continued widening of the gap between the North and the South and the persistence of many chronic conflicts in the South  they are afraid that the iron curtain which in the past separated East from West could now divide the North from the South. This is a prospect that the international community should avoid most resolutely.Egypt hopes that  with the coming of the twenty-first century  we shall be on the threshold of a world that will be more in keeping with the aspirations of the oppressed peoples  a world of less disparity between its North and its South  less injustice between rich and poor. The countries of the South  even though they do not possess science and technology  do possess a rich heritage of wisdom  civilisation  tradition and moral values. This is a heritage which no one  regardless of his degree of prosperity or level of development can ignore.Let us approach the twenty-first century with the hope that the North and the South will complement each other and not distance themselves from each other. We hope that the gap between the North and the South will shrink  not widen  that their interdependence will become a way of life that cannot be altered. The developed world must understand this  just exactly as the ancient understood it when he expressed their surprise at the complementarily of the objects of our balanced material universe. I have long seen the river pour its waters into the sea. And yet  the river has not dried up  nor has the sea overflowed its shores."

I warmly welcome the Principality of Liechtenstein  which has just become a new Member of the Organisation.This session is beginning as we face the consequences of Iraq's invasion  occupation and annexation of Kuwait. But that event - which is unprecedented in the history o£ the United Nations and to which I shall refer again later - should not make us forget that 1990 marks the end of a chapter of the history not only of Europe but of the world. The entire post-war European scene has been peacefully and irrevocably transformed; the firm perseverance of the peoples of Europe and the calm position taken by the leaders of the Soviet Union have been decisive in this. It is as though the people of Central and Eastern Europe had awakened from a long night of silence and fear to find that they were no longer spectators  but the protagonists of their own history. After years of suffering  they are now finding direction and hope.No tears were shed when on 8 November 1989 the Berlin Hall began to crumble  but the historic reunification of Germany has had to overcome many moments of mistrust. The culmination of that process in a few days will mark the tangible end of the cold war and will be a sign that Europe is regaining its own identity. We are pleased at the exemplary manner in which this has taken place. I wish to express the admiration and sympathy with which Spain has witnessed the process from the outset  and I congratulate the German people on its regained unity.A wind of freedom is sweeping down the old roads of Europe  and we must now strive to guarantee peace and stability on that continent. In this the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) can play a vital role. It is the right forum for negotiating new measures of security and confidence  for strengthening economic co-operation and for monitoring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The summit of Heads of State of the CSCE to be held in Paris can make a decisive contribution to strengthening stability  disarmament and co-operation.None the less  there is still reason for concern. The greatest threats to democracy in Central and Eastern Europe involve the outbreak of heightened nationalism  xenophobia and irredentism. This is combined with the widespread impatience and frustration that characterise times of great change. My country is very much aware of the dangers that stalk during the transition from authoritarianism to open democracy.We are convinced that  to a greater or lesser degree  the changes in Europe will affect developments in other continents. In today's world  major change knows no boundaries. Before the recent changes in Europe  nearly all Latin American countries had broadened their freedoms and consolidated their democratic systems despite enormous difficulties of all kinds. Today we can all feel a little like Berliners - with joy and not concern as in 1963 - when we look forward to the crumbling of other walls. I am thinking of the Soweto wall of intolerance and fragmentation and the walls in other relics of totalitarianism  which are beginning to collapse despite the past blindness of such regimes.Today the international community’s attention is focused on the conflict in the Persian Gulf unleashed by the decision of the President of Iraq to invade  occupy and annex Kuwait  an independent State Member of the United Nations. Thanks in part to the new climate of détente engendered and strengthened by the changes in Europe  it has been possible to provide a united and resolute response to the first international crisis since the end of the cold war.The speed and effectiveness with which the Security Council has acted in this grave crisis are embodied in a series of resolutions that lay the foundation for a peaceful settlement of the problem. Only yesterday the Council adopted a new resolution  another in the series of measures taken to complement those enacted earlier. It is important for us all to continue our best efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to this dangerous conflict. The Arab countries have an important role to play in facilitating a peaceful solution within the clear framework established by the Security Council resolutions.My country has adopted a group of international measures to comply with the embargo  and has joined the international community's peace efforts by sending three Spanish naval vessels to the region to give effect to an embargo which  in our view  is the best means to make the Government of Iraq reverse course.I shall not dwell on obvious  much-repeated ideas  but I wish briefly to highlight the points Spain views as basic. First of all  no negotiated solution can be acceptable outside the framework established by the Security Council. Secondly  it is our duty to put a stop to aggression while avoiding war. To that end we must manifest our conviction that law and reason are on our side. We must maintain a firm position  preserve and strengthen our unity and act with patience. While the continuation of the crisis will surely have its costs  the costs of war would be far greater.The gravity of the crisis must not blind us to the fact that thanks to the new international climate and the work of the United Nations and its Secretary-General we have achieved positive results in various conflicts  to some of which I shall now refer.Namibia recently gained full independence thanks to a process admirably guided by the United Nations. We welcome Namibia as a Member of the Organisation and reaffirm our resolution intention to increase our bilateral ties of friendship and co-operation.In South Africa  we finally saw the liberation of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners along with the adoption of measures towards in-depth constitutional and legislative changes that will bring about full freedom for all. Once there are guarantees of those changes and of the total abolition of the apartheid system. South Africa will be able fully to rejoin the international community. There must be efforts to overcome the serious outbreaks of violence that have recently occurred. In Central America  thanks in large measure to the perseverance of the region's leaders  a sound peace process is under way. National reconciliation in Nicaragua and the demobilization of the resistance are now reality. The basis has been established for negotiations which  we hope  will lead to peace and reconciliation in El Salvador and Guatemala. From the outset my country has participated in the front lines of the work of the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ONUCA)  and we are ready to continue providing the Secretary-General with all necessary co-operation and assistance.In Cambodia  following determined efforts over the past two years  the permanent members of the Security Council have set in motion an ambitious plan which  after acceptance by the parties to the conflict  could be the basis for national reconciliation.My Government welcomed with great satisfaction the recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  and we are following with great interest the various contacts to which that meeting gave rise  including those intended to resolve the question of Korean representation in this forum  which Spain wishes to be truly universal.We reiterate our desire to continue negotiations to resolve all differences with the United Kingdom on the question of Gibraltar. The only solution is re-establishment of Spain's territorial in with respect for the legitimate interests of the population of Gibraltar  in conformity with resolutions of the General Assembly.With respect to Western Sahara  we expect the continuation and success of the Secretary-General's happy initiatives to organise  without administrative or military constraints  a referendum in that Territory to ensure the self-determination of the Sahraoui people  with the necessary international guarantees. We believe it would be beneficial to all to retain the consensus achieved last year in the General Assembly.The absolute need to settle the Gulf crisis must not allow us to forget the need also for a comprehensive approach to the situation in the Middle East. We continue to believe it urgent for Israel to begin dialogue with the Palestinian people that could lead to a comprehensive and just settlement on the basis of ""land for peace""; such a settlement can be based only on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). My Government still views the policy of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories as illegal from the point of view of international law; that policy is an obstacle to peace in the region. We are convinced of the need for a just and lasting solution that will both protect the self-determination of the Palestinian people and recognise secure borders for all the countries of the region. We believe the most appropriate avenue is an international conference under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all the parties concerned.But the problem is broader in scope. After various contacts with other countries in the region  particularly Italy  my country has just launched  in Palma de Mallorca  an initiative to convene a Conference on Security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean modelled on the CSCE - the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. That would be a comprehensive progressive approach to establish rules and principles for stability in the region. We must not allow ourselves to think that when the Gulf conflict is settled everything will return to normal  because nothing will ever be the same again. Massive collective efforts will be required. Spain is a Mediterranean country and will continue its active co-operation with other countries of the region to defend our common peace  progress and security. In that way we hope to contribute to the stability of this zone of conflict  a zone where there are nevertheless many opportunities for co-operation  as seen in our common history and shared culture.I have been talking about the efforts of the United Nations on regional conflicts. But if we do not want a world where the will of the strongest prevails  we must not undervalue the role the United Nations can and must play in the solution of conflicts through legal means. To that end we must be aware of the need to strengthen the principal legal organ of the United Nations  the International Court of Justice. The Spanish Government thus intends to submit before the end of the year the optional declaration referred to in article 36 of the Statute of the Hague Court  accepting its compulsory jurisdiction.In these times  when East-West tension is ending and new forms of co-operation are appearing  we must speak of the global problems and challenges facing the international community: disarmament  the growing gap between rich and poor countries  drugs  the deterioration of the environment and the need to protect human rights.On conventional disarmament  we must aim for November signature of a treaty dramatically reducing armaments in Europe. It is necessary to promote confidence-building measures among States. We need objective and standardised exchange of information on military expenditures  capabilities  activities and structures to promote that confidence. The United Nations system has an important role to play in that respect.On nuclear disarmament  Spain wishes for an early conclusion of an agreement under the strategic arms reduction talks (STAST) between the United States and the Soviet Union. Once a treaty on conventional disarmament in Europe has been signed  negotiations can begin to reduce short-range nuclear weapons. On the other hand it is imperative that we consider effective ways and means to halt nuclear proliferation; in so doing  it is necessary also to retain the safeguards system of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  the application of which can certainly be improved.The non-proliferation framework cannot be complete without the necessary movement towards a universal system of missile control. We attach great importance to the 1987 initiative  to which Spain has subscribed and which is being considered by other States as well.The Spanish Government is concerned at the delay in formulating an international convention prohibiting the production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and governing the destruction of existing stocks. The recent Gulf crisis makes it even more urgent to give new impetus to this work.It is also very important to give fresh impetus to development. One of the most important challenges we face is probably to overcome grave international economic imbalances. No are all becoming increasingly aware that political peace cannot be attained or made complete without advances along the road of economic development to reduce the vast differences between rich countries and poor.The United Nations system has the means to lay the foundation for a new and different kind of international economic relations. We must approach this problem in a now way  as became clear last spring at the special session on international economic co-operation. First of all  we must avoid the old ideological perspective by which the developed North is solely responsible for the structural ills of the developing South. Nor do not think we need to speak of responsibility  but rather of joint responsibility  taking into full account the concept of interdependence  with all its consequences  and ridding ourselves of notions of one-sided guilt. If we refer to international economic relations  it is imperative that we approach a  set of particularly important issues. The first is the overwhelming problem of external indebtedness that threatens to strangle the economies of many countries und to bring them to the brink of despair. Secondly  but equally critical  is the question of the international trade regime to be signed at the Uruguay Round. It is urgent to devise a formula that reduces and if possible eliminates the instability of commodity prices  which are the prime source of export coming for most of the developing countries. Finally  we should support the process of integration of the Soviet and Eastern European economies  into the international financial and trading regimes  without weakening the commitment and support of the industrialized countries towards developing nations.Spain is increasing its effort· towards co-operation with developing countries and especially with those in Latin America. Spain has already signed agreements with some of them that envision the transfer of sizeable financial resources. In the last five years  my country has tripled the volume of resources allocated bilaterally to development assistance. We also intend to participate  within the framework of the European Community  in the signing of agreements on commodities that will allow  as far as possible  the stabilisation of developing countries' export earnings. Finally  we are aware that external indebtedness has become an intolerable burden for many developing countries  Spain has decided to support the international strategy represented by the Brady Plan  we have signed bilateral refinancing agreements with several Latin America countries and is also aware of the need to pay due attention to the financial capabilities of the debtors to repay their loans and attach a lesser priority to the amount owed by then  for otherwise that would lead to a schedule of payments that they would never be able to meet.The protection of the environment is another of the global challenges that our community of nations must face without delay. In that task  the United Nations can play an essential role  and is in fact doing so now. We place our hopes in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development that is to take place in Brazil in 1992 to devise a strategy to halt the deterioration of the environment while increasing efforts to encourage sustained economic growth in all countries. For Spain  as a Mediterranean country  the specific problems of our region - forest fires  land erosion and  most particularly  desertification - have special significance. The environment differs from region to region.The war against narcotic drugs will not be won without effective and alert international co-ordination. In that respect  the special session on narcotic drugs was a pivotal Milestone in the long history of United Nations efforts in that field. The 1988 Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances has been ratified by Spain. When implemented by all countries  it will be a decisive element in the struggle  which must attack production  traffic and consumption. We must persevere in actions aimed at fiscal control of the drug dealers bank accounts. The laundering of money obtained from trafficking is  as we all know  closely related to arms dealing. It is also desirable that the operations performed under the umbrella of tax havens be unveiled and expunged. We must put an end to the scourge. The promotion of human rights . Last year the convention of the Rights of the Child was adopted. Spain signed it early in the year and will ratify it as soon as the appropriate parliamentary procedures have been concluded. What better opportunity is there to celebrate the adoption of that Convention than the World Summit for Children that is to take place in a few days in New York. Also approved last year was the Second Optional Protocol for the abolition of the death penalty  which Spain has also signed and hopes to ratify in the near future. Long is the legislative path travelled by the Organisation in the field of human rights. Even longer is the path yet to be travelled in terms of effective control of the honouring and observance of existing rules.I should like to stress one issue. There must be no doubt whatsoever that no Government can hide behind the shield of national sovereignty  non-interference in domestic affairs  or any kind of paranoid recourse to the existence of an alleged international plot as an excuse to escape an impartial investigation by the Organisation when its members deem it necessary. On the other hand  it becomes necessary to clear up the misunderstanding to the effect that we  the Western countries  ignoring ethnic  cultural or religious differences  are attempting to impose our seal· of values on other geographical regions. It must be quite clear that what the Western countries intend - and along with us many others from other regions - is that all States should steadfastly respect the provisions of the Charter in that field and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Hunan Rights  which establish the ground rules from which nobody can detract  and that others that have signed specific agreements on human rights - agreements that enforce universal  I repeat  universal standards regarding human dignity and  the promotion and protection of fundamental rights - should truly honour and openly account for their actions before the established monitoring mechanisms. Those are the requirements that we must all honour equally  including those derived from commitments into which we have freely entered.I should like to conclude by stating that in this successful year of changes and promising horizons  yet also of serious crises and unexpected global problems/ the United Nations has pursued its process of revitalisation/ enhancing its prestige along with great pragmatism and reliability in its actions. Today  from the fertile ground of peace-keeping operations to decisive action in fields as transcendent as the Security Council's response to acts of aggression  actions regarding the environment or drug trafficking  and ranging from the new pragmatism and willingness to negotiate that prevail in such fields as disarmament or co-operation for development/ the Organisation is still the sole universal forum available to sow the seeds and reap the harvest of solidarity for future generations.Now that we can talk about a new era of international relations/ now that so much has changed in such a short time we can say with greater reason than ever that the United Nations must become the highest moral and political authority to lead a world in peace. Spain  which sustained that doctrine when the Organisation was at its lowest ebb  stresses it now even more resolutely. We need rules  criteria  and standards of behaviour that reach beyond rhetoric. From now on we must efficiently tackle the old and the new problems of the world at the end of the millennium. The time available to us for preventing those problems from becoming catastrophes is not unlimited. In fact  it is short. Yet the solution is not beyond us. It is within us."
"49",2280,"ETH",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and on my own behalf  I join those who have extended sincere congratulations to Mr. de Marco of Malta on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-fifth session.In addition to expressing its sincere appreciation to Mr. Garba  who presided with great skill over the deliberations of the General Assembly at the forty-fourth session and the three special sessions  the Ethiopian delegation wishes also to welcome the admission of Liechtenstein as the newest Member of our Organisation.Heartfelt gratitude is also due to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  who  ever since his election eight years ago  has with foresight and painstaking efforts rekindled the hopes and confidence of the international community in the United Nations.This session of the General Assembly comes in the midst of historic developments on the world stage and  in a sense  forms a watershed between two different epochs in international relations. The era of the cold war  with all its attendant tensions and threats  is coming to a close  and a new world order  whose major features are not yet clearly evident  is gradually emerging. While this new order appears to be mainly characterised by greater international understanding and co-operation  we must guard against certain tendencies which could give rise to uncertainties.The political implications and effects of recent events and trends have obviously given high hopes for a better system of international relations  we are already witnessing a rapprochement between the super-Powers and a certain reduction of international tension. Confrontation is giving way to accommodation and competition to co-operation. The prospects for the dissolution of the cold-war military and political structures also seem quite bright.Europe  which epitomised the division of the world  is undergoing profound changes  ushering in an era of co-operation and possible integration. Indeed  we are today on the eve of the historic unification of Germany  an event on which we warmly congratulate the entire German nation.In other regions of the world  too  we see nations pooling their energy and resources to form larger economic and political groupings. The reunification of the two Yemeni States  which we welcome heartily  and the emerging prospect for better understanding between the two Korean States are but a few instances of a growing trend  which must be encouraged and supported.With regard to Korea  the international community must support the realisation of the noble and long-cherished goal of the Korean people for peaceful reunification. The steps we take and the positions we adopt within the United Nations on this question must enhance and promote  and not vitiate  this process of reunification of Korea.The perceptible improvement in the international scene  especially in the relations between the super-Powers  has also resulted in some modest advance on the question of disarmament. Despite this  however  the arms race is yet to be definitively halted and reversed and vital resources for human development and progress released. The international community  therefore  must continue to give this issue priority attention and must further strengthen its efforts towards A world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.The current atmosphere of better understanding and greater co-operation is also contributing towards the resolution of the many regional conflicts that have been endangering peace and stability in many parts of the world. The first and so far best example of international co-operation in the resolution of conflicts in the recent past is the long and fruitful process of negotiation that resulted in the accession of Namibia to its long-awaited independence. Namibia's independence and its admission as a full-fledged Member of the United Nations is a source of immense gratification and pride to all of us  especially to the Namibian people  which has for so long waged a heroic and difficult struggle. The United Nations too must be proud of the unprecedented role it played in Namibia's peaceful transition to independence.The overall positive changes in international relations coupled with Namibia's independence also seem to be having some impact on the situation in South Africa. We all acknowledge that  as a result of measures taken within South Africa  hopes for a peaceful and early demise of apartheid are rising. However  the conditions for the commencement of substantial negotiations  set out in the Harare Declaration of the Organization of African Unity and the Declaration of the sixteenth special session of the General Assembly  are yet to be completely fulfilled. More importantly  the main pillars of the racist system are still intact  and the regime itself has not declared a non-racial  united and democratic South Africa as its ultimate goal.In the circumstances  it would be very unwise  indeed counter-productive  to ease the pressure  both economic and political  against the Pretoria regime. Ethiopia  therefore  urges the maintenance of all the sanctions currently in effect against South Africa until the process of change reaches an irreversible stage.As regards other regional conflicts  the easing of global tension and the rapprochement between the super-Powers have opened new avenues for the peaceful resolution of hitherto seemingly intractable problems. Of particular significance in this context are the situations in Central America and Cambodia.In our own subregion  too  a process of peace and better understanding among the States of north-eastern Africa has recently been launched  in which my country has played a very active role. Inasmuch as the responsibility of finding peaceful solutions to regional conflicts and problems rests primarily with the Governments of the region concerned  the Heads of State and Government of Djibouti  Ethiopia. Kenya  Somalia  Sudan and Uganda have recently taken concrete measures that are of major significance for relations among their States. In their July 1990 meeting in Addis Ababa  the Heads of State and government of the sis countries  after a thorough analysis of the prevailing situation in their sub-region  adopted the historic Declaration of Peace  Stability and Development.In one of the most important provisions of that Declaration  the SIX Governments committed themselves to co-operate towards the peaceful resolution of internal conflicts prevailing in the sub-region by supporting each other's peace and reconciliation efforts  Furthermore  they reaffirmed their position that any peaceful resolution of internal conflicts in the sub-region shall invariably be sought within the framework of the national unity and territorial integrity of the affected State.Following this important conference  and pursuant to the Addis Ababa Declaration  the Foreign Ministers of the sis States met in Nairobi on S7 and 28 August 1990 and held useful discussions on the modalities for implementing the objectives contained in the Declaration. While this regional effort is still in its initial stages  the parties are  none the less  confident that it will enhance the prospects for peace  stability and development in the sub-region. Convinced that it is only through such dialogue and co-operation that lasting peace and stability can prevail in our countries  the Ethiopian Government and people are determined to extend full support to this regional initiative. Cognisant also of the fact that peace in Ethiopia is closely related to peace in our sub-region and vice versa  and in line with the discernible international trend towards peaceful resolution of conflicts  the Government of Ethiopia will continue to pursue  unilaterally and through the regional forum to which I have just referred  as well as through other channels  its declared policy of resolving peacefully the internal conflicts in Ethiopia. My Government is confident that its declared policy of peace and the measures it has taken so far in this regard will enjoy the increased support of the international community.The significant exception in this otherwise happy trend of resolving regional conflicts through peaceful dialogue is the situation in the Middle East. Complicated as it is now by the current situation in the Gulf  the Middle East crisis continues to pose a serious threat to regional peace and security. In this regard  my country will continue to support the realisation of the legitimate aspirations of all the peoples in the region as well as the right of all the regional States to live within recognised and guaranteed borders. Ethiopia will also continue to encourage peaceful dialogue between all the parties concerned within the framework of Security Council resolutions 242 C1967) and 336 C1973).Notwithstanding all I have just said  we have no illusion that peace on Earth is about to become a pervasive reality  ka we all realise  the threat of nuclear confrontation still hangs over humanity. Many conflicts  both internal and international  remain unresolved. Kb a result  the danger of small conflicts triggering off a major conflagration is still a distinct possibility.The invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq seems to have justified our serious concern at the precarious nature of world peace  in spite of all the salutary events at the global level. With regard to the Gulf crisis  Ethiopia has taken an unequivocal stand against aggression and for respect of the principles of the United Nations and  as a member of the Security Council  has been actively involved in the deliberations and decisions of the Council on this issue. Committed as It is to the purposes and principles of the Charter  and having itself been a victim of aggression and of the failure of the community of nations to live up to collectively assumed obligations. Ethiopia is very much heartened by the latest unanimous and universal condemnation of the Iraqi action and the collective enforcement measures taken thereafter.The kind of solidarity extended to Kuwait and the single-mindedness of purpose manifested  particularly among the permanent members of the Security Council  augurs well for the maintenance of world peace and security. Based on this solidarity  we must all persevere in our efforts and take appropriate measures to ensure that aggression and lawlessness do not succeed in this case and in others. For if they do  the new world order that could emerge would be one where the law of the jungle  and not the precepts of justice and legality  would reign supreme.As I indicated earlier  the current international situation has fostered positive developments in many fields of international endeavour. Unfortunately  this same situation has also given rise to certain anxieties  especially in international economic relations. With the negative trends of the 1980s still continuing  new tendencies have also arisen which could impede international economic co-operation.	.As we all recognise  most of the factors which were instrumental for the economies of the developing countries to stagnate  and for those of the least developed among them to regress  are still prevalent today. Commodity prices are continuing to plummet  while the external debt burden of developing countries is growing at an alarming pace. With the fast decline in the flow of concessional and other forms of finance  international interest rates  the price of industrial goods and trade protectionism are all rising. The recent steep increase in the price of oil has further battered the economies of oil-importing developing countries. All these and the existing structural trends  such as population growth and environmental degradation  are thus compounding the plight of the developing world. To halt and reverse these dangerous trends and alter the unjust international economic environment  developing countries had over the years spearheaded many multilateral initiatives aimed at establishing a new international economic order. Regrettably  however  the response of the developed countries to these initiatives has been far from supportive. Even the programmes which we have jointly embarked upon under the aegis of the United Nations have not given the desired results owing to lack of wholehearted support from our developed partners. Neither have the policy prescriptions of the major international financial institutions - the so-called traditional structural adjustment programmes - proved to be a panacea for the chronic economic ills of our countries.Worse still  the recent changes at the global level are dimming the prospects for international development co-operation. With the apparent decline of the importance of strategic considerations  development co-operation is losing much of its attraction and impetus. As a result of preoccupations with internal reconstruction  Eastern Europe is virtually ceasing to participate in the efforts towards the development of the third world. The industrialised West in also preoccupied with events in Europe as well as with the consolidation of economic blocs among its members. Furthermore  financial resources are increasingly being allocated to countries of Central and Eastern Europe  while resource flow· to the third world are being burdened with onerous political and economic conditions.In the face of all these unhealthy trends  developing countries are doing their best to meet the challenges of the present-day world. Africa  which is threatened most by the process of marginalisation of the third world  has embarked on fundamental socio-economic reorganisation. Accordingly  most African countries are taking painful measures to reform their economies and enhance productivity and efficiency.  At the international level too  a number of initiatives have been taken aimed at promoting international economic co-operation in the 19908. In this context  the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris last month  has  I believe  sufficiently highlighted the very grave situation facing those countries  the large majority of which are African. The programme of action adopted by the Conference represents a solemn commitment to assist the least developed countries overcome their severe developmental problems  and its successful implementation will depend on shared responsibilities and strengthened partnership between them and the donor community.Convinced as we are that the efforts being undertaken at the international and regional levels to extricate the third world from the quagmire of underdevelopment are merely a complement to national efforts  we in Ethiopia have  despite our difficult situation  embarked upon a process of reform and restructuring. These reform measures include  inter alia  promoting and encouraging the full participation of the private sector in the economy  managing the operations of State enterprises on a competitive basis  and encouraging foreign investment in various fields. These  and the related legal measures that make up the profile of our new economic policy  are primarily intended to stimulate economic growth and national productivity; but  again  we can achieve these objectives only within the context of a supportive international economic climate.We therefore hope to see generous increases in concessionary assistance  especially to the least developed countries  and the adoption of bold measures to alleviate their debt burdens. We also hope that the regional and economic groupings taking shape among the developed countries and the policies they pursue will not lead to protectionism and restrictions but  rather  to openness and international economic co-operation. International co-operation must also be extended to the protection of the environment  which is becoming a burning issue of our time. While environmental degradation in the North is the result of industrial progress  the problem in the South is mainly caused by poverty and underdevelopment. Though both the North and the South must follow environmentally sound development policies  the South would need the increased assistance of the North in order to halt and reverse the deterioration in the environment of our common habitat.I should like at this moment to express our gratification at the successful conclusion of the World Summit for Children  and reaffirm my Government's determination to improve the well-being of all Ethiopian children by implementing fully the Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted by the Summit.It is my delegation's considered view that unless the relative amelioration in the international political scene is matched by progress in international economic co-operation  the promise of peace will be a mere mirage. Indeed  if some current trends are not reversed soon  widespread poverty and deprivation in the poorer countries  especially in Africa  will generate social unrest  tension and instability as well as mass displacements of people  with dangerous implications for international peace and stability.The developing countries  and particularly those in Africa  cannot and will not accept relegation to a perpetual marginal existence. In this small planet of ours  we cannot continue to have two worlds  one characterised by degrading poverty and deprivation  the other by affluence and plenty. Also  we must not allow the East-West confrontation to be replaced by a North-South divide  with the North  at best  attempting to impose its own models of general development and economic growth on the South or  at worst  totally neglecting it. This session of the General Assembly is  in many ways  the first post-cold-war convocation of nations to deliberate upon all the major issues facing our planet. This makes the present session a unique opportunity to review and assess the world situation from a new perspective and with a fresh approach. Though most of the issues on the agenda of the Assembly have been with us for many years  we must now approach them in a spirit commensurate with the imperatives of the time. Reiteration of old positions and persistent adherence to failed formulas will not suffice to meet and overcome the challenges of today. A new vision and a bold approach which would shape the future of international relations is what the peoples of the world expect from us.We must therefore nurture and promote the positive trends already developing in the relations between States  big and small  for these should constitute the foundations of the new world order. We must also ensure that the beneficial effects of the improving situation at the global level permeate the entire gamut of international relations  so that the encouraging changes we see today do not carry latent seeds from which new crises may emerge. Let us also extend our unreserved support to the United Nations so that this unique  universal Organisation  which embodies the ideals of multilateralism  will attain the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter."
"50",2326,"FIN",45,1990,"﻿I take great pleasure in seeing you  Sir  a distinguished representative of the Republic of Malta presiding over this session of the General Assembly. Finland has been in close co-operation with Malta both in Europe and in the United Nations. We know that our countries share fundamental convictions about world order and world organisation. I wish you every success in your responsible task. I wish to take this opportunity also to thank your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria  for the outstanding services he rendered to the General Assembly during the last session.In Europe the year 1989 will be remembered as a year of momentous change and a breakthrough of popular will. The year 1990 has been a year of consolidation and of elections confirming the course of change. We welcome these developments. We welcome in particular the spirit of freedom and democracy that has animated peaceful change both in Europe and elsewhere.It is all the more tragic that mankind in 1990 has had to witness a singularly blatant act of aggression by Iraq against Kuwait. Therefore the year 1990 has for the United Nations become a year of collective action is the face of aggression. The international community has shown solidarity and determination in allying the sanctions mandated by the Security Council because of the occupation of Kuwait.The response by the United Nations represents great progress in the ability of the world Organization to live up to its ideals and act in defence of the freedom  sovereignty and integrity of one of its Member States.Finland is strongly of the view that political problems everywhere must be solved peacefully and that social and political change also must come about peacefully. This principle applies to the Middle East  to the Persian Gulf and to other crisis areas just as well as to Europe. Europe is heading towards a new existence  without confrontation and without the cold war. We are not yet sure what the new Europe will be like in all its details; but we trust that it will offer all its inhabitants opportunities to live in dignity and freedom without discrimination and without fear.What is sure and  indeed  gratifying is that Germany will be unified the day after tomorrow. German unification will be an essential building block in the new undivided Europe within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE;  λ milestone in this process will be the summit of the CSCE countries to be held in Paris in November.Much remains to be done in order to meet the aspirations of the peoples of Europe. At the same time  the new Europe cannot be oblivious of the needs of the rest of the world. On the contrary  Europe needs all the other continents  and Europe must be open to all of them.The building of a new structure of peace in Europe is under way  but the underlying ideas and principles are already in place. In fact they are in evidence right here in this Organization  for they are universal. The new process in Europe flows directly from the principles of national self-determination  political freedom and social justice.We believe that there are important lessons to be drawn from the recent events in Europe. First of all  it has become clear that the ideas of freedom  democracy and human rights are so powerful that sooner or later they will reassert themselves. This does not mean that mankind is thereby brought to the end of history  as some have claimed. There are important and difficult challenges to face both in individual countries and in co-operation on a global scale.Secondly  the abandonment of the totalitarian regimes in a number of European and other countries also helps enhance international confidence and security. The easing of the military confrontation is well under way in Europe. In the long run  this should make it possible to devote growing resources to other pressing needs instead of armaments. Thirdly  an emerging awareness of global priorities seems to have been prominent in the dynamic movement for change. This is important for the new directions that must be given to international co-operation in the nineties and beyond.This new awareness is strongly felt in Europe  but it is in fact global  present in all parts of the world. This very awareness moved the General Assembly five months ago to agree unanimously on the Declaration of International Economic Co-operation. It is one of the forces driving the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to take place in Brazil in 1992. The ides of sustainable development should now direct the preparatory work for that Conference as well as the preparations for the new international development strategy which will be formulated by the General Assembly during the present session. The problems that will be on the agenda of the 1992 Conference require urgent action by Governments. They require action now and they require long-term policies. I am thinking  for example  of policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other substances that have a direct impact on the climate of the Earth as a whole.For decades Governments have rallied to the idea of development  and development has been interpreted largely as the combination of growth and change - sometimes maybe only as growth of the gross national product. Today  we know that a more comprehensive concept is needed. We welcome the combined emphasis on environmental protection and development in the preparations for the 1992 Conference  for in the long run  one is not possible without the other. We welcome  too  the emphasis on human development  which should lead to freedom from disease  ignorance and political repression.However  it is more and more difficult to envisage how the resources of the Earth can sustain a steadily growing world population. Human development and dignity cannot be achieved with the present rates of population growth. All individuals should be able to enjoy equally the benefits of development  human rights and peace. In this general debate it is not enough to speak only about general trends and global challenges. Some specific issues and problems must also be addressed.Let me first express my country's satisfaction at the continuing trend towards universality of membership in the United Nations. Less than two weeks ago  we welcomed the most recent Member State  the Principality of Liechtenstein  a country with which Finland has closely collaborated in the process of advancing security and co-operation in Europe. This year  we have also welcomed the Republic of Namibia as a Member of the United Nations. Namibia's independence - after a long process culminating in free and fair elections - bears witness to the ability of the United Nations to promote peaceful change. Namibia's Constitution based on pluralism could serve as a model for other countries in Africa and elsewhere.More attention will now be focused on South Africa where far-reaching political Change is called for. We recognise the real change that has already taken place in South Africa. The measures taken to remove some parts of the apartheid system are steps in the right direction  and we welcome them. We are encouraged by the assertions of the South African Government that the process of change is irreversible.Guided by their commitment to a peaceful process of negotiation  the Government of South Africa and representatives of the majority population should now lay the basis for giving all South Africans  regardless of the colour of their skin  a common responsibility  a common stake in the future of their country. As avenues to peaceful change are being opened  there is a concomitant need for all to renounce violence as a means of dealing with South Africa's pressing problems. The dialogue should help to build confidence and overcome fear. Progress will require mutual moderation as well as mutual understanding. Finland keeps the situation in South Africa under close and constant review. We do not regard it as opportune to lift the sanctions that Finland imposed on South Africa some years ago in accordance with the Nordic programme of action against apartheid  since apartheid is still there. In recognition of the change that has occurred we have  however  modified the guidelines concerning the issuance of visas to South African citizens. Thus  we want to facilitate contacts that may contribute to further dialogue in South Africa. If the reforms in South Africa continue as we hope they will  we shall review our Finnish policies towards South Africa accordingly.There is one region in the world which is not yet a part of the trend towards peaceful political change - the region of the Middle East.Every State Member of the United Nations is now affected by the aggression against Kuwait and its occupation which has continued since the beginning of August. Every Member State is engaged in our common efforts to dislodge the aggressor and achieve a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the occupied country. One cannot but be concerned at the fate of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians  of both Kuwaiti and other nationalities  many of them fleeing in a state of destitution and panic  as well as at the shocking news that is seeping out from occupied Kuwait itself.All of this shows that international efforts to end the occupation are not enough. Solidarity and generosity are required of all of us  both to help the suffering people and to re-establish order and well-being. Finland's own experience tells us that we must work  above all  for the strengthening of the principles of international law which protect the interests of all nations  in particular those of the small ones. Respect for these principles is essential for our own existence and independence. The independence and integrity of Kuwait are matters of vital importance to Finland.If necessary  the United Nations should not shrink from taking further steps to overcome aggression and uphold the principle of collective security.The search for international peace and security has also prompted Finland to serve the United Nations elsewhere in the Middle East where the need for peace  stability and the end of occupation is no less urgent. The tension in the region is also continuously experienced by almost 1 000 Finnish soldiers  on duty as peace-keepers for the United Nations. Here the world has already waited too long for decisive steps to be taken from peace-keeping to peace-making.It is clear to us that Israel and the Palestinians must live peacefully as neighbours with full respect for the rights of each other  including  of course  the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognised borders  as well as the right of the Palestinians to national self-determination. The well-known resolutions of the Security Council must be implemented. The road to progress may include elections  negotiations and an international conference of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The present policies of Israel in the occupied territories have exacerbated the situation instead of laying the basis for progress towards a comprehensive political settlement.This Organization was created in order to help nations change themselves and the world peacefully. That is still the aim of the United Nations. That is the kind of change I have spoken about and welcomed today. At the same time  we are committed by the Charter not to tolerate change imposed by violence. These are the two challenges now facing the United Nations. Let us meet them together."
"51",2370,"FJI",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President it gives me great pleasure to add my own congratulations to you on your election to the prestigious office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Malta  a snail island State like my own  has played an important role in world affairs  far out of proportion to its size  and it is a tribute both to your country and to its people that one of its prominent sons should preside over this world Assembly. Tour own record and accomplishments are well known and we look forward to a productive session under your leadership.The past year has been a period of great accomplishments  in which the President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session  Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria  played a prominent role. No would like to congratulate him on so skilfully fulfilling his responsibility. The United Nations has come into its own  and Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar is to be congratulated on his outstanding contribution to this.We would like to join other delegations in extending a warm welcome to Liechtenstein  which was admitted three weeks ago  and to Namibia; which joined the Organisation in May. We were honoured to be among the group of sponsors for their admission. Our congratulations go to Germany for re-establishing its unity and national identity a few days ago.On the subject of reunification  we welcome the dialogue between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Korea. We applaud the contacts between the Governments of North and South Korea. We urge that both sides be encouraged to join the United Nations  either individually or both at the same time. However  joining should not be conditional on the consent of either side. There have been enough instances to show that later unification is not precluded by initial separate membership of the United Nations.Much has happened since the opening of the forty-fourth session of the Assembly. There has been an enormous upsurge of feeling towards greater freedom and openness in many countries where the State apparatus has  for over four decades  remained not merely as a formidable presence  but also as the sole arbiter of all that affects the lives of those concerned.The ending of the cold war should herald more than the easing of tensions between the super-Powers. It is a golden opportunity to extend the basis of international reconciliation  including application of the peace dividend to combating poverty and underdevelopment. Like many other speakers  we hope that the arms control and disarmament resources which become available as a result of the reduction in military expenditure will be used to address the many and compelling urgent needs of the world's poor.The expectation of a world in which there would be reduced tension and greater prospects for a more durable peace was shattered by the invasion of Kuwait. The unity with which the Member States acted to condemn the aggression and apply sanctions against Iraq has been unprecedented. The invasion of Kuwait is both an ominous phenomenon and a dangerous signal to the smaller States. We hope that the crisis now confronting the world can be defused without upon hostilities and that the legitimate Government can re-establish its sovereignty in Kuwait.The progress being made between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pretoria Government in South Africa  the agreement of the parties to the conflict in Cambodia to accept United Nations involvement  and the slow but steady forward movement in Western Sahara are all highly satisfactory signs of a new determination in the search for peaceful solutions to once-intractable problems.We subscribe to the widening internal concern over environmental issues; it is high time. South Pacific peoples and Governments have for two decades strongly opposed the use of our region as a tasting-ground for nuclear weapons by France. We are still firmly against such testing and would again call on  and indeed invite  France to cease this practice.Recent action on reducing the use of ozone-depleting substances and the banning of drift-net fishing are important steps  but they must be built upon. Much still remains to be done. The effects of global warming  especially on low-lying island communities must be seriously addressed. This state of affairs can be attributed to the excessive and uncontrolled practices of industrialised countries. Now  developing countries are being asked to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of overcoming this problem. For instance  we note with concern recent events on boycott the purchase of tropical timber. A number of developing countries derive a major portion of their income from this source and would be seriously disadvantaged. Κ strong case exists for some form of compensation to these countries to enable them to make up for the revenue forgone  as well as to assist them to carry out reforestation programmes.We in the South Pacific are alarmed at the intention of the United States to use the Johnston Island facility to destroy its stocks of chemical weapons  especially those that are being transferred from Europe. In addition to the fact that the movement of those stocks constitutes a danger  the potential consequences for our region are not sufficiently known or understood to justify the destruction process there. My government supports recent initiatives towards the convening of an international conference on the Middle East. Such a conference should provide the basis for addressing long-outstanding problems afflicting the region  including a homeland for the Palestinian people and the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to an existence safe from threats to their territorial integrity. And here it would mean to us that  with its recent most commendable record of success  the key role should remain in the hands of the United Nations  under the distinguished and capable leadership of the Secretary-General.Within the context of the global socio-political upheaval of the late 1980s  much of them based on a reawakening of indigenous consciousness and aspirations  we in Fiji have ourselves been going through a period of difficult readjustment. But  when even within the broad sweep of global events  those in my country appear miniscule by comparison.On 25 July last  a new Constitution was promulgated  the culmination of three years of patient effort by many people to devise a workable framework for constitutional progress. In bringing the Constitution into effect President Sir Pensia Ganilau said:""In the 20 years since independence  we have tried to build a multi-racial society which responded to the aspirations of all our citizens. Achieving the right balance was not easy. The main races formed two monolithic groups; there was little assimilation and much fear of domination. Divisions were deepened through contrasting cultural traditions and attitudes Politics became polarised. There was the necessity to protect the special rights of the [indigenous] Fijiani  who had become a minority in their land. At the same time  we had to take into account the legitimate interests of the other communities. Fijians bad to preserve their identity  their culture and  sometimes it seemed  their very existence. Fiji was the only source of their culture and being. If they lost their identity end rightful position here  then what was left for then? Would they become yet another marginalised remnant of a once proud people?""In terms of fundamental rights and freedoms  the President noted:""The Constitution  therefore  places great emphasis on fundamental rights  freedoms and representation ... An elaborate Bill of Rights has been formulated and made part of the Constitution. The rights it protects are identical in all respects to those in the independence Constitution of 1970 ...""The individual rights conform to all the major United Nations instruments relating to human rights protection. Among rights specifically guaranteed are the rights to life  liberty  security of the person  the protection of the law  freedom of conscience  of expression  assembly and association  protection for the privacy of house and other property and from deprivation of property without compensation. Every person in Fiji is entitled to these fundamental rights and freedoms  regardless of race  sex  place of origin  political opinions  colour  religion or creed.""The President concluded by saying:""My message to all the citizens of our multi-racial country  with its numerous ethnic groups  is that Fiji is home to us all. Here  with compassion  understanding and goodwill  we can live together in happiness. We have made remarkable progress in social and economic reconstruction since 1987 through the co-operation of all the people. The promise of great prosperity and national fulfilment is very close. Together we must continue to build Fiji  in peace and harmony."" Our Constitution is the most practical solution  given the prevailing circumstances in my country. With goodwill from all  we believe that it can be developed to accommodate future changes. A review period of seven years has been included  which period will allow time to benefit from the working experience of the new Constitution.We ourselves recognize that the way ahead will not be easy for our people. But the enormous reservoir of goodwill and respect that have characterised our collective approach to vicissitudes will be important assets as we move forward to consolidate the foundation which the new Constitution has laid down. And we would call on all friendly countries to assist and support us in this process so that the progress already made can be further strengthened.Fiji and her peoples have undergone some traumatic changes over the past three years. We have been enormously encouraged and sustained by the understanding and support of many friendly countries. At the same time  we have been bewildered by the continuous sniping by а number of countries which  we would have thought  had greater appreciation of the difficulties our country was going through. Unfortunately  we have been sadly disappointed by both the lecturing and the posturing of a number of countries that appear to have arrogated to themselves the right to be moral and political arbiters of how we should conduct our affairs.The world community is at an important crossroad. It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that the future prosperity of most developing countries will depend on change  in many cases radical changes  in the willingness of the industrialised countries to take realistic steps to open up their markets. The developing countries must export to prosper  but they meet numerous hurdles in trying to gain access to the industrialised economies for many of their products. Although some progress has been made under the generalised system of preferences  three quarters of the dutiable exports of the developing countries do not enjoy preferential treatment. Non-tariff barriers remain a major impediment to freer trade.Subsidies paid by the developed countries to their own farmers seriously undermine the ability of the developing countries to gain more lucrative and stable markets. Statistics seem to show that one third of the exports of the developing countries to developed markets are affected and in some important groups of items the proportion goes as high as three quarters.Looking closer to home  the island developing countries  of which my own country is one  and which are widely recognised as the most fragile and vulnerable of all the developing countries  find themselves in a particularly difficult position. There are over 20 island developing countries and Territories in the island Pacific subregion  very widely scattered over an enormous geographical area. Most of them are small and some are tiny  both in physical size and population  and natural disasters are a frequent occurrence. Four are within the category of least developed countries. Their links to the outside world are few and poorly developed and highly expensive to maintain  but without them they could not live. They are heavily dependent on outside sources for the supply of many essentials  having very few resources and a negligible productive capacity themselves. Many still have dominant subsistence sectors. Their small size and remoteness make them highly vulnerable to the forces of nature  and hurricanes occur frequently  λ recent report of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (BSCAP) has confirmed little or no growth in 1989 and 1990 for many Pacific island States because of devastation caused by hurricanes over the past year. The increasing attention being given to the small island nations and territories will  we hope  result in greater appreciation and support for their uniqueness.In this regard we welcome the lead role which the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development {UNCTAD) has taken recently in focusing on the specific characteristics and needs of the island developing countries. The highly useful collation of the features and characteristics of island developing countries which UNCTAD carried out last year was an important step forward  as was the UNCTAD meeting on island developing countries which was held in June last. We look forward also to seeing specific provisions included in the new arrangements which will be considered by UNCTAD VZII.Having learned from past experience  Fiji is currently embarking on new economic policies which are designed to ensure that the difficulties of the 1980s are not repeated in the 1990s. A more outward-looking  trade-oriented approach to development has been adopted and the measures of protection and subsidy that were earlier intended to promote import substitutions are being dismantled. Export promotion through positive means has been introduced and is being vigorously implemented. We are dependent to a considerable degree on the preferences open to us in the developed countries  particularly those embodied in the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement with Australia and New Zealand - and we are damply grateful for this particular contribution to our development - those of the United States under the generalized system of preferences  and those under the Lome Conventions batman the European Community end the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries. These have already resulted in some encouraging export successes and we anticipate significant new investment in Fiji as a consequence. Accordingly  we expect to earn our way primarily through our own efforts  as well as by capitalising on the range of preferences available to us. It is axiomatic that these national programmes can succeed only within a supportive international trade environment  which we hope will be the rule rather than the exception in the decade of the nineties and beyond.As we stand on the threshold of the third millennium many forces and factors - social  economic and political - are converging to give new challenges and opportunities to the world community. What we do with those opportunities will become the basis of the heritage which we shall leave to the generations who succeed us. Let us not give then cause to regret their forebears."
"52",2417,"FRA",45,1990,"This is the third time I am speaking before the Assembly  and I feel that this is an honor both for my country and for me personally.  I congratulate you  Mr President  on having been chosen to guide the debates of an Organization which since its creation has perhaps never had such heavy responsibilities. I hail the country you represent.  I now turn to the Secretary-General  Mr Peres de Cuellar  and I thank him for the talent  strength of conviction and tireless activities he has been devoting to the United Nations and which have contributed so much to its renewal.  Two years ago from this rostrum I referred to the prospects for freedom. How much headway has since been made. I many countries  on all continents  democracy has won out  in places where it was often thought that it would be kept away for a long time to come. Borders can no loner contain its radiating strength.  Think of the dramatic changes that occurred in Europe and throughout the world in 1989  of the deep popular movements which  like the French Revolution 200 years ago  overcame everything: structures  systems  ways of thinking and   powers and fears  '97 and all for the sole  compelling need to live differently  in keeping with the requirements of the spirit.  When the walls that separated peoples came tumbling down  '97 walls built in the mistaken belief that the order they were protecting would forever escape the great winds of space of dreams and of ideas  '97 I remember saying to my compatriots in France that  in these happy hours of which there are so few in history  the end of an order did not necessarily mean that another order would immediately be born  and that it would be very difficult.  I ask the Assembly: What are we to make of this new era which is at once so promising and so perilous? Yes  what shall we make of it? The confrontation of military blocs long ensured peace  while maintaining conflicts in a geographical context. After the Second World War  we witnessed more than 100 regional conflicts. What we call the South had become the theatre for battles which were no longer taking place in the North. The gain for one camp was perceived as a loss for the other. Although this summary arithmetic is now outmoded  one sees how for almost half a century it blocked evolution towards settlement and lessening of tensions  how it prolonged the suffering and mourning of sorely tried peoples  how it served as a laboratory for power relations and how it prolonged the dependency of millions of human beings who once thought they were masters of their destiny.  The end of the East-West conflict should be hailed as the triumph of reason and of a sense of responsibility. And this conquest is due to the courage and the clear-sightedness of certain men who were able to change the courage of history and overcome immediate interests and the clash of ideology in order to conceive of a new balance which would no longer be based on universal terror. Here  I wish to say that mankind owes them a great deal of gratitude and respect.  However  I would refrain from engaging in premature optimism. Like everyone else  I know how much illusion there can be in a vision of the world that had  all of a sudden and without any difficulty  found its way. There remain numerous flagrant  intolerable violations of human rights. Ethnic and religious minorities are still persecuted. Interests are as brutal as ever: the strong still lie in wait for the weak  and the oppressed entertains revenge. Nevertheless  henceforth the confrontation of blocs can no longer serve as an excuse for those who fear risking democracy  for those who believe that they can postpone until later what is expected of them today. In saying that  I have in mind  '97 and you have understood it  '97 North-South relations. In a world where no one  not even the most powerful  can escape the interdependence of destinies  one is tempted to look inwards to find a way out  as if the only way to affirm one '92s identity and differences would be to deny those of others  as if this need could find an answer in xenophobia or nationalism. A good example of this will be the conclusion to be found to the crisis brought about by the Iraqi aggression  just as the tragedy in Liberia serves as a warning. If we are not careful  the unique opportunity offered by the demise of blocs will become a bad dream.  To prevent anarchy  disprove the theory that might makes right and avoid the imposition of an alliance of the powerful of an order in which others have no voice  I know of nothing but the rule of law. Yes: law. No one - no State  no philosophy - has a monopoly on law. Law reflects the general will. And is it not remarkable that we are now witnessing the emergence of a nearly universal agreement on the simple values: freedom  '97 freedom to speak  to act  to travel and to elect one '92s leaders  '97 equality  justice  respect for human rights  tolerance  and the acceptance of differences. All these are values that stress the value o dialogue over force. We all know that there can be lasting peace and freedom in relationships between peoples only if States agree to follow common rules  which it is your responsibility to lay down.  With the North Atlantic Treaty Organization paralyzed  the United Nations - 45 years - is now coming into its own as a genuine judge  defining and trying to implement the law; it is beginning thus to fulfill its mandate under the San Francisco Charter. On that basis  everything will - or at least can - change. We must all understand that the dawning of the rule of law concerns us all. What country can feel safe from violence  high-handedness and domination by others? The time has come for international law to reign. We need only take decisions and actions on that basis. In recent years  in fact  the Organization has increasingly been successfully involved in the settlement of conflict: Namibia  Nicaragua  the Iraq-Iran war and  soon I hope  Cambodia. United Nations efforts to eliminate the hateful apartheid regime have finally been met by the good will of two men  both South Africans  both having the ear of their respective communities: Nelson Mandela and Frederik de Klerk. But we must go further. We are faced with a choice between the law of the jungle and the rule of law. What will happen if we refuse to choose? The alternative is between those who want law to triumph and those who are content with the dictates of violence.  I am thinking now  of course  of the Gulf crisis. The conflict initiated by Iraq against Kuwait showed that the Security Council could act quickly and with one voice. From the onset of the crisis  my country  a permanent member of that body  voted for and at times initiated successive resolutions adopted there. We continue to stand in full solidarity. Let me explain why.  Kuwait is a sovereign State member of the international community. On what basis can it be decided that that State has ceased to exist? On the basis of the  '93law '94 of aeroplanes  tanks and cannon? I should note here that France has long had friendly relations with Iraq; we supported it at the time of greatest danger  during its war with Iran  with a view to preserving  on the age-old border  the historical balance between Persians and Arabs  the destruction of which would have had a chain reaction in the entire Arab world right to the shores of the Atlantic. I do not deny the links of friendship forged in this circumstances between the Iraqi and French peoples  and I hope that in spite of everything they will survive this trial.  But France is first and foremost in the service of the law as defined by this arbiter between nations: the Organization. We are implementing the embargo decreed by the Security Council  and we are helping ensure its general implementation. To that end  we have sent air and naval forces to the Gulf region  but in doing so we have made no threatening or provocative gesture. Our policy is the policy of the United Nations. Moreover  we have informed the Iraqi authorities that we will stand by anyone who is the victim of new aggression in the region.  Our actions are defensive  not offensive  but they will be neither accomplices nor idle observers. When their mission was accomplished  our forces will leave the area and return home.  How can we not be disgusted at the taking of thousands of hostages  including more than 500 of my compatriots  until recently welcomed by Iraq - as it has itself admitted - as guests  as friends trusting in the hospitality of a noble people  among the oldest and most illustrious on Earth. How can we accept that some of them are serving as human shields in a fight which is not their own? How can we accept the violation and looting of the residence of our Ambassador in Kuwait and the arresting of its occupants? If this was really done in error  why did it take so long to admit it  and why was the number of hostages swelled with these new victims? In the face of these repeated acts  I took the decision dictated by honor and solidarity  and sent land reinforcements to threatened countries neighbors of Iraq. My doers remain as they were: to ensure the success of the embargo and thus to impose the implementation of Security Council resolutions  to contain all aggression  to serve peace with respect for law  giving no quarter to violence. I add that France is acting in close agreement with its 11 partners in the European Community and the Western European Union  and in co-ordination with United States  Arab and other military forces deployed in the Middle East for the same reasons. That co-ordination in no way affects our autonomy of decision.  We continue to be prepared to pursue and search for any possibility for peace  for ours is a logic of peace  standing against the logic of war that Iraqi policy has imposed upon an anguished world and that seems to prevail. To date  not one action  not one word by the President of Iraq has held out even a glimmer of hope for conciliation. He ignores or rejects the supreme body  the United Nations  an Organization which was created in the wake of the Second World War by nations that knew the cost of bloodshed and death  having been twice unable to triumph over the inevitability of disaster.  What will Iraq say if the conditions set forth in the Security Council resolutions are imposed? They were agreed upon unanimously and cannot be revoked. Is this the end of hope? Is there no room for peace? We do not wish to pronounce such a verdict.  Several plans  now including that of Heads of State and Government of the Arab States  have opened up new prospects. I am pleased by this. France had hoped the countries of that region would arbitrate among themselves to solve disputes that pit them against each other. I should like here to state that that is still our hope. It is desirable that there be an end to any doubt or suspicion about any armed intervention by Western Powers. But the Arab nation has not yet overcome the divisions that have separated it  and thus far it has only expressed desires.  In the absence of such a solution  it would be my preference that we see in what context diplomacy might still prevail over confrontation. Let us be clear about this. I say there can be no compromise so long as Iraq does not comply with the views of the Security Council and withdraw from Kuwait. That country '92s sovereignty is not negotiable  any more than any other '92s. Think of the men and women living under foreign occupation who must choose exile  and of neighboring peoples which  if things get out of control  will be at the mercy of the expansionist determination of one man  of one warlike State. If  on the other hand  Iraq were to affirm its intention to withdraw its troops and free the hostages  everything might become possible. At the second stage  as I perceive things  the international community  which has condemned the aggression  would be able to guarantee the withdrawal of military forces  the restoration of Kuwait '92s sovereignty and exercise of the democratic will of the Kuwaiti people.  Then the third stage  which the whole world is anticipating without much hope  would begin - a stage that today seems to be beyond our reach  or is feared because it will be a time for choices when we must replace confrontation in the Middle East with the dynamics of good-neighborliness and security and peace for each and every country.  I have in mind Lebanon  which has been unable to regain full sovereignty over its territory and is still occupied by foreign troops and divided by opposing forces. I have in mind the Palestinians who are prey to despair and tempted by all kinds of adventures to meet their legitimate aspirations to have their own homeland in which they can create State structures of their choice. I have in mind Israel  which is living in constant insecurity. In a word  I have in mind all those countries where war  declared or not  has become their daily lot. I am not talking about a mixture of different kinds of conflict. Nor do I claim to be able to solve all these problems through any magic recipe  because any comprehensive step would be unrealistic and dangerous and give an excuse to do nothing.  Our initiative implies dialogue  direct dialogue between those concerned  agreement with neighboring States  and finally the irreplaceable approval of this Assembly. And at the end of that road we must take up the idea of an international conference as the catalyst and the qurator of the implementation of any successful negotiation. Above and beyond this  we might think of a fourth stage  with a mutually agreed reduction of armaments in the region  the beginning of co-operation from Iran to Morocco  from the Middle East to the Atlantic  and stability and prosperity in a region that  because of its history  culture and invaluable contribution to humanity  is called upon to play an important role in human affairs.  But let us now look at ourselves. We too must ask questions and answer questions that are arising everywhere. So many previous resolutions of the Security Council have remained dead letters  '97 the result  I like to believe  of the mutual neutralization caused by the East-West antagonism  which condemned the Near and Middle East to a kind of war of positions - a ruinous  desperate war. That situation has today  and with some reason  nourished the Arab worlds '92s criticism of the sudden diligence of the United Nations in regard to Iraq. And it is true that n this shortcoming there is an unfortunate element that somewhat undercuts the real authority of our recent decisions. But we are united in our belief that law and justice should be the same for all - in principle and in effect.  Now I should like to emphasize a crucial point that has always been of concern to international bodies and is now brought into sharp focus. If the Middle East conflict is not a North-South conflict because it does not pit a rich country against a poor one  the fact remains that the embargo  the reduction of oil supplies and increased prices have worsened the already difficult living conditions in the developing countries. If we come to the assistance of those close to the conflict  which are those most directly affected by it - and with this I fully agree - above and beyond that  we must renew the unfinished debate on North-South relations between the rich and the poor  between the highly industrialized countries and those that lack the means to pay their debts or to revitalize their anaemic economies. The year 2000 is approaching  and each day some 40 000 children the world over are still dying from hunger and sickness for which treatments and vaccines are available.  In a few days a World Summit for Children will be held here in New York to consider such problems. But we must also be aware that there are other injustices which in themselves constitute unbearable violence and that violence gives rise to still further injustices. How can those hundreds of millions of human beings who live in the direct poverty  deprived of everything including a future  be expected to have an awareness of a society based on the rule of law? Who  denied and rejected  can honor a law from which he himself is excluded? Like it or not  North and South are partners in a common history. It is high time that both sides understood that fact. Some progress has been achieved in recent years  but it still falls far short of what is needed. Is it normal that countries that have gone into debt in order to develop their economies should find themselves crushed beneath the burden of that indebtedness  or that people should work and produce more only to receive less  solely to repay the interest on their country '92s loans  subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange? Is it normal that Africa and Latin America  to mention only those continents  should have experienced a constant drop in export earnings throughout the past decade or that  notwithstanding the large amounts of aid it receives  the South continues to finance the North  because the net transfer from South to North has increased  as of this year  by another $10 billion  thus reaching the sum of $43 billion? We can  of course  note some progress. At the Conference of Least-Developed Countries held at paris this month we noted a fortunate but insufficient trend. At Toronto in 1988  at the summit meeting held at the Grande Arche in Paris in 1989  the larger industrial countries came up with various methods designed to bring about a reduction in world indebtedness. Some States  including France  forgave the debts of the poorest countries. At for the European Community  through its renewal of the Lome agreements with 60 African  Caribbean and Pacific countries and a large increase in its contributions it has dealt forthrightly with an inherently explosive state of affairs and has laid the ground for a first step towards making exports more feasible.  Other initiatives have been undertaken with a view to redressing the imbalance  which nevertheless cannot but increase. But how can such steps withstand the increased speculation in raw materials? I look forward to the long-announced and long-hoped-for discussion of a comprehensive plan for assistance to the developing world  a plan that would be fed by new resources and that would lath the ground for an in-depth consideration of the subject by all the participants in what could well become a tragedy to end all tragedies if we do not make up our minds to change our ways  to step up our pace and to rethink our goals.  In spite of all I have just said I believe that an era of hope is dawning for mankind if all peoples can agree to overcome their perception of history as unalterable and their interests as unchangeable. And yes  I do believe that that is possible. After having engaged in destructive combat with each other three times in less than a century  France and Germany are now reconciled. How rare this is! Today they are joined in a special relationship; they are members of the same Community  they meet regularly  they are joined in mutual respect and they are establishing a friendship. As I speak today  a few days prior to German reunification  far from dwelling on the tragedies of the past our peoples are looking together towards the future. From New York  I salute the Germans  who are preparing to celebrate this great event in their history  and I send them France '92s best wishes.  Today  French-German understanding is a fact  as you know  within the framework of the European Community  the Twelve  and there too how many agreements  how many battles and how many conflicting  age-old ambitions moved towards a solution when  40 years ago  in a daring and almost unbelievable move  European countries - first 6  then 9  then 10 and finally 12 - joined their destinies so closely that soon their borders will disappear and soon there will be a single  common market  a monetary union and a political organization without precedent in the world  with a population of some 340 million persons.  We wonder at the determination and imagination of those in the post-war generation who have led us to this result. And yet there is an even broader plan to come  a plan that has just begun to take shape  an even vaster plan that will cause us as Europeans to look beyond the Twelve and off to the distant horizon to take in all the historical and geographical continent of Europe. The meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Paris on 17 November of this year will define the content of that plan and set up permanent bodies to work towards that Europe. What would our old continent be like today if bold action had not prevailed over generally accepted ideas  if its peoples and their leaders had not determined to build a future that would be different from the past? A part of that Europe are the so-called Eastern countries  countries that yesterday belonged to another  competitive and adversary system. Today they are the masters of their own fates. And how  by what means? Surely they should draw closer to the European Community  either by associating themselves with it or by seeking ways in which they can eventually cove together. We must think of them  for they are our brothers  and their actions will influence and affect ours  until all the countries of Europe are more solidly linked together  the countries of the East and those of the Community  the free-trade countries and those without allegiance to any system  in what I have called a confederation  in an organization with its own rules and in which other country can build its future together with its neighbors  each able to act on its own behalf.  In building the future we must also pursue disarmament  an area in which Europe has provided the first actual providing-ground. But as all present here today are aware  disarmament is a world-wide necessity  and in our region the task is far from complete.  The Vienna Talks on so-called conventional disarmament must be concluded as soon as possible  but in the other areas  of biological  chemical and strategic weapons  the new balance in the world can no longer put up with the ruinous cost of the arms race. We are at the crossroads of two centuries  and we can express our dreams in three words: disarmament  arbitration and collective security. There has been disorder  dictatorship and war all at the same time. Let us see to it that through the United Nations  right  solidarity and peace finally govern in these new times. "
"53",2485,"GAB",45,1990,"﻿Sir  your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session is a tribute to your personal qualities. It reflects the contribution of Malta  your country  to our common work of peace and co-operation between peoples and nations.The delegation of Gabon considers it both a pleasure and a duty to extend to you our wishes for full success in the discharge of your heavy and honourable task.Major-General Joseph Garba  your predecessor  through his dedication and competence has also served the United Nations well. My delegation joins in the tribute unanimously rendered to him today.Indeed  the United Nations will remember the extremely positive action of Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar in the restoration of our Organization to the role given to it by its founders 45 years ago. I should therefore like to express to him the sincere congratulations of Gabon and assure him of its readiness to work towards the achievement of peace and justice in the world. Gabon would like to welcome the recent admission of Namibia and Liechtenstein to our great Organization.The course of present international relations causes some disquiet as compared with the serenity characterizing them not so long ago. This contrast  which appeared in a rather brief period  has caught the United Nations short because of its unexpected nature. Through the United Nations  each one of its Members must take any initiative conducive to the restoration of a climate of confidence more in keeping with the ideals that have brought us all together here.Our Organization seems to have reached an important moment in its evolution. We declare our readiness to become firmly involved in the building of a new order of security in the interest of all and in the struggle for development. We could not succeed in that endeavour without being animated by a firm resolve to eliminate persistent scourges  such as apartheid  drugs  and economic and social underdevelopment  to which the General Assembly has recently devoted special sessions. These are some of the main challenges that we must face.But it is none the less true that the spirit of peace has made great progress as an essential fact of the coexistence of nations. Other human values  such as democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  are also observed more closely today. Indeed  from a study of these last few years we can conclude with certainty that contemporary societies are becoming more democratic. It is in this context that profound institutional changes are now being brought about in Gabon  where  by means of elections that are taking place  we are embarking on the setting up of a multiparty parliament.In response to the wishes of its compatriots  the President of the Republic  His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  convened a national conference on democracy  which was held at Libreville in March and April last. That historic meeting involved all the views represented by many political or social/professional associations.The debate on ideas was held in a spirit of openness  freedom and responsibility. There resulted a national consensus  thanks to which a new constitution now rules Gabon's political life; a national charter of freedoms has been adopted; a government reflecting several political views has been established; and to watch over the smooth functioning of the fledgling democracy  a national council for democracy and a committee entrusted with following through on the decisions of the national conference have been created.That same mission will be assured in the media by the National Communications Council that will be set up following legislative elections. These multiparty elections  the first held in my country in more than a generation  mark a crucial stage in the strengthening of democratic mores in Gabon. The new institutions  which will now serve as a framework for Gabonese political life  will be built  above all  on the primacy of law as a guarantor of stability and respect for our institutions. We should like therefore to affirm here that democracy  in its universal avocation  is a secure path for the transition of societies that have reached a certain stage in their evolution.In my prefatory words I stressed the role played by our Organization towards its rehabilitation. I note that some of the subjects on the agenda of this session of our Assembly point precisely to this trend. The profound changes that took place in international life through the consolidation of the climate of détente led to the beginnings of genuine peace perspectives and the settlement of some regional conflicts.We must note here that the forces that led to the reunification of some parts in the world that had previously been divided are based  not only on the universal need for the self-determination of peoples  but also  and above all  on these same changes. The decision of the two Yemens to merge into a single State  the imminent reunification of the two Germanys  and the high-level talks recently undertaken between the two Koreas testify to the genuine capacity of the peoples we represent here to contribute peacefully to the course of history.We are however far from being secure from all sorts of tensions because many problems still remain with us.If we consider the situation now obtaining in Africa  it is regrettable indeed that the history of that continent will have meted out a particularly painful fate to some of its peoples. The continued unjustified practice of apartheid has given rise to mass movements of peoples and is indeed the main cause of the phenomenon of refugees in southern Africa. We should see there an additional reason to address an appeal to the international community that it do everything to bring about the full implementation of relevant decisions adopted by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). We should also support initiatives within and outside South Africa to achieve as soon as possible the dismantling of that odious system of apartheid. In this spirit Gabon welcomes the liberation of Nelson Mandela and the legalization of anti-apartheid movements  but we note with regret the paltry nature of the measures supposedly leading to the elimination of apartheid. Gabon is therefore in favour of maintaining sanctions against South Africa. But the fate of these African populations is not predicated only upon apartheid; internal and border conflicts are also causes of the same problems. In themselves  border conflicts  because they involve sovereignty  raise the problem of their settlement within the machinery advocated by the United Nations or the Organization of African Unity (OAU).In the specific case of the Chad-Libyan border conflict  my country  which presides over the Ad Hoc Committee set up by the OAU  took an active part  in the past year  in the process of implementing the agreement concluded in Algiers on 31 August 1989. Thus we have observed carefully the functioning of the Joint Technical Commission provided for by that agreement. Indeed  we organized  in Gabon last March  a tripartite meeting at the ministerial level  during which we proposed to the parties to the conflict a draft protocol for the implementation of the Algiers agreement. This proposal was partially agreed to by both parties  which undertook to continue negotiations on some outstanding points.Now that this Organization  through the International Court of Justice  is seized of that problem  we should like to express our appreciation to the other States that have contributed to the quest for a political solution to the dispute  as well as our conviction that we have done everything possible in that direction.Unfortunately  the crisis in the Middle East  which continues because of the increasing lack of understanding  has just experienced another episode  which adds to the complexity of the debate on this region and thus weakens the efforts being made in the search for appropriate solutions.As to the classic aspects of this debate - that is to say  Lebanon and Palestine - Gabon advocates resort to machinery whose creation and setting up  on the basis of relevant United Nations provisions  would make possible comprehensive Solutions to these questions  in particular  the proposal to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  should be implemented as soon as possible.The gravity of recent events in the area - since the entry of Iraqi troops into the territory of Kuwait - is a matter of concern to us all. In considering the situation thus created we must mobilize all the political and diplomatic means at the disposal of the international community  in keeping with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.There have recently been significant developments in the situation in Cambodia. We welcome  among other things  the agreement expressed by the parties to the conflict on the framework  proposed by the five permanent members of the  Security Council  for a comprehensive and lasting political settlement of that conflict.The changes that have taken place in East-West relations  which formerly were based on the balance of terror  should  logically  result in radical changes in the political role allotted to nuclear weapons. Indeed  since 1988 the main owners of nuclear weapons have agreed on the principle of reduction  and they may conclude an agreement on the means by the end of this year. These changes and the continuation - of such efforts should lead to a climate favourable to a new balance based on dialogue  trust and respect for mutual interests. Only in this way will future international relations  whether political or economic  become more secure and more stable.It was entirely appropriate that the General Assembly devoted its eighteenth special session to international economic co-operation and development. The  Assembly's conclusions on the situation of the world economy in the 1980s  the prospects for improving that situation  and the commitments that were made by the Assembly make possible a positive view of that event. The renewed assumption by the United Nations of a role in respect of the problems relating to the North-South dialogue  if it is characterized by a global approach  should result in new hope. The advantages of such an approach are obvious. Applied to the thorny question of the treatment of debt  for example  it would avoid priority being given to economic aspects over social aspects  or to political aspects over moral aspects.As was said by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa in his last report  external constraints are an essential element of the economic standstill in Africa. Indeed  in addition to an ever-worsening balance of trade from year to year  there is an ever-heavier burden of debt  amounting  for the African countries alone  to about $260 billion - that is to say  one fifth of the total debt of developing countries. Our countries have adopted programmes of structural adjustment  and have participated in agreements for the rescheduling of debt. On this basis  they have taken  individually  measures to improve their finances and their budget procedures  and have done so despite negative consequences at the social level - consequences that might become less dire if creditor countries were to lessen the debt burden.In this respect  Gabon - a country of medium-range income - welcomes the reduction in the rate of interest on the public debt unilaterally decided upon by France. This initiative is proof of the role of international solidarity in the handling of economic difficulties. We renew the appeal repeatedly made by the Group of 77 for the debt of developing countries to be cancelled.During the last two years the world economy has  it is true  grown more rapidly than was expected  but balance has not been achieved in the global development of economic relations between industrialized and developing countries. In the case of Africa in particular  there remain reasons for deep concern for the future of the continent. Standards of living in general have deteriorated for the fourth consecutive year because of lower commodity prices and because of Africa's small role in international trade. To confront this imbalance  which is endemic  the models of development in our countries must be restudied. How can we stop playing the simple role of producer of commodities  to which we are restricted? How can we ensure equilibrium in the balance of payments and the renewal of export income? But it would be illusory to review the models of development adopted by our countries if we did not acquire financial resources  if we did not learn more about trade in commodities and improve the role of our countries in world trade. That is why we believe it is urgent that there be agreement on an equitable and final solution to the problem of debt  an increase in the resources allotted to development  co-ordination of national macro-economic policies  and promotion of a system of international negotiation.If current international political and economic issues are matters for concern  so are questions relating to the environment and population. As to the environment  the objective is to make public opinion in our respective countries aware of the dangers threatening the security of all of us - anarchical deforestation  soil erosion  water and atmospheric pollution  depletion of the ozone layer  illicit traffic in toxic waste  and so on. These fundamental problems could be debated at the conference on the environment to be held in Brazil in 1992.The question of the future of world population is at the forefront of the concerns of our Organization. The operation launched a few years ago by the United Nations Population Fund bears witness to that fact. If I were to sum up my comments so far  I would say that our Organization's rehabilitation is going hand-in-hand with a genuine touch of humanization in its consideration of the major issues. This must surely be a sign of the times; a reflection as it is of the diversity and the financial strength of its Members  the United Nations holds within itself all the trump cards it needs for its revitalization. This is a general rule  in fact a universal law in the progress and future of any organ. Each Member State must naturally  therefore  do its utmost to help the United Nations achieve its revitalization.This comes down to saying just how essential is the issue of what resources to grant the Organization. The United Nations cannot escape the burdens of all kinds which weigh on the progress of mankind towards a better world. Nevertheless  we must on each occasion deal with those burdens by trying to be imaginative enough to cope with them  and in doing so we would not be the first to travel the road: the generations that came before us were faced with the same challenge. However  better armed than they as we are  we should enter into the next millennium  which is almost upon us  with confidence and determination.  "
"54",2532,"GBR",45,1990,"﻿May I start by congratulating you most warmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly and by paying tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba. We are already accustomed to the calm and authoritative way in which you conduct our discussions. I should like also to pay a very warm tribute to the Secretary-General. We have benefited greatly from his wisdom and energy during this last year  and  as he knows  we will rely on them perhaps even more enthusiastically in the time ahead.What a contrast there is between the General Assembly today and that of a year ago. In 12 months we have seen the passing of an old and unmoored order. The end of last year  1989  was a time of great excitement. We were lucky to witness that rare happening: a peaceful revolution. Usually  I suppose  in world affairs surprises are unwelcome. But last year's surprises were almost all good news. Less than a year ago  President Gorbachev told the Government of the German Democratic Republic that time would not forgive those who came too late. One month later the Berlin Nail was torn down.Mow  on 3 October  the German people will reunite in peace and democracy. We have just heard an eloquent analysis and commitment from the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Hans Dietrich Genscher  on that subject. I would simply add on behalf of the United Kingdom that on that day  3 October  we shall share wholeheartedly the happiness of the German people. It will be a big day  of course  for Germany; a big day and a welcome day for Europe and for the rest of the world. As one of the four wartime allies  we are proud of our part in helping forward that process. There was an immense amount to do when the 2 plus 4 process was first dreamt of in Ottawa in February  but we worked swiftly  thoroughly and as partners and the 2 plus 4 Agreement signed this month in Moscow was a first major achievement of the new world order. Last autumn the Foreign Minister of Poland  Mr. Skubissewski  who is here today  became the first representative of a democratic Government in Eastern Europe to address the General Assembly. That was an extraordinary change. Nobody then predicted that almost all the other countries in Eastern Europe would over so short a time begin by questioning and end by rejecting communism before this  the next session of the General Assembly.The change of course has not been confined to Europe. In South Africa the State President  a white politician elected solely by a white minority  the leader of a party dedicated traditionally to apartheid  first released Mr. Nelson Mandela from prison and then sat down in friendly and determined negotiations with him. We must assert ourselves to help forward those two men and  more important  the peace process that they are now undertaking.But we should not be mesmerised by these happy changes. We must now knuckle down to the mundane task of making these changes a part of everyday life  of our habits of thought and our instinctive sense of reality. We cannot yet be sure of the permanence or the full consequences of the ""velvet"" revolutions around the world. We need to remember that the great Chinese statesman Chou En-lai  when asked what he thought of the French Revolution  replied  ""It is too soon to tell"". I am not suggesting that we need 200 years for reflection  but I am sure we would be wise to proceed with caution and with caution  renewed determination.Certainly there has been great enthusiasm and great achievement; that is beyond gainsaying. But it does not mean that the new order is safely or completely in place or universally accepted. On the night o£ 2 August  President Saddam Hussein reminded us of reality.By invading and annexing Kuwait  he brought instant soberness to a world that was perhaps in some danger of believing that the millennium had arrived 10 years ahead of time. 0f course  the aggression against Kuwait was not the first act of unjustified violence with which the United Nations has had to deal. Of course there have been many acts of aggression and injustice since 1945  and some of them  we must remember  remain partly or wholly uncorrected. But there was something about the simple brutality of the attack on Kuwait that put it in a category by itself. It was clear; it was complete. Every principle of international law was flouted. Only the most desultory attempt at an excuse was brought forward and then even that excuse was immediately abandoned. The Charter of the United Nations - our document - was held in complete contempt. It is for those reasons that an extraordinary and unique coalition of the international community has formed against the aggressor.Iraq's aggression dominates our thoughts about the Middle East  but we must not lose sight of other issues in the region. We must not lose night shove all of the need for a just solution  at last  to the Palestinian problem. We have no intention of forgetting that piece of unfinished business. But any solution to that problem will have to rest on respect for international law and respect for engagements entered into. That is why before that problem can be solved we must deal with the case of Iraq and Iraq's aggression. The chances of a more secure world order depend directly on the success of the international coalition which I have mentioned in reversing the occupation of Kuwait. The test is formidable; there can be no doubt about that. But the test cannot be evaded. This is a defining moment. How we act now will define  will shape  the next decade.So it seems to me that we can be enthusiastic about the real progress which has been made in the world  provided that we are sober about the tasks still to be accomplished. I would like to look very briefly at the system of international relations in which we must work. The basic unit in the system  the basic unit in this Hall  the basic unit in our Organisation will continue to be the nation state - this nation-state system which emerged  I suppose  in its modern form in Europe in the nineteenth century; and in the twentieth century the colonial empires  first in Eastern Europe  then in Africa and Asia  were transformed into smaller nation states. It is not a perfect system; no one hero would claim that. But it has proved enduring and it has been supplemented by regional grouping. Where these groupings are successful they smooth the rough edges between nation states. They bring together by choice the efforts of Member States for a particular purpose  and I believe that that will endure.I would like to focus for a minute or two as a European on the three principal groups of this kind in Europe: the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (HATO)  the European Co—unity  and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCX).NATO held a summit in July in London and that summit took two fundamental decisions. We decided that NATO should remain as a defensive alliance with an integrated command which provides a framework for the stationing of United States and other forces in Germany. I believe that history shouts for the need for the American presence in Europe. It was a mistake after the First World War that Americans went home - a mistake which we all regretted and repented. But the second decision of the NATO summit in July was to extend in a new way and with a new emphasis the hand of friendship and co-operation from MASO to the member countries of the Warsaw Pact  including of course the Soviet Union. As a result of the London summit  HAXO will remain but HAXO will change.The second key body in Europe is the European Community. Since 1985 the European Community has developed a new dynamism. Future development should be both wider and deeper. It should be wider because I would expect that applications from a number of other European States for full membership will be accepted before the end of the century. As you know  Mr. President  two are already to hand. Some applications may be from members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA); some may come from the newly democratic States of Central and Eastern Europe as they complete their transformation to free-market economies. It seems to me inconceivable that the Europe of Twelve which we have today could or would wish indefinitely to shut the door of membership against fully qualified European democracies which are anxious to join  whether they are now members of EFTA or whether they are in the centre or the south or the east of Europe.We are also deepening the Community by completing the single internal market to dismantle barriers to trade in goods and services and to movement of people. We are preparing two intergovernmental conferences  both of which will begin under the Italian presidency at the end of this year. In one we shall seek to improve the working of our institutions; in the other we shall consider plans for economic and monetary union. The steady British argument  repeated in meeting after meeting  is for a liberal  open  evolutionary approach in all these discussions.The third European structure is the CSCB. Here we are working to establish more firmly a common system of values  common standards for international behaviour among European States. That all sounds very high-minded. What does it mean in practice: I think it means some very specific things in practice. It means we need to underscore the protection of human rights. We need to guarantee the rule of law. We need to guarantee free elections. We need to work in general towards a common understanding of the fundamental freedom of individuals and the duties of government. Much of this was sketched out in the Helsinki Final Act IS years ago. I remember that at the time some of us looked a little warily at the high-sounding promises of that Final Act in Helsinki. But there are many brave individuals in the world today Kho can testify from their own experience that out of those promises of 1975  cut of those undertakings came effective pressure and eventual action to give them their liberty and their rights.How  a treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe (CFE) is a prerequisite - an indispensable prerequisite - for the CSCB summit  which we hope will be held in Paris in November  and for the CFE treaty hard  urgent work now lies ahead for those of us who are concerned. If we succeed in negotiating that CFE treaty in Vienna  we will have brought about a rough military balance on the European continent; we will have removed the ability of all signatories to launch a surprise attack or to start large-scale offensive action. For the first time  the main instruments of physical force will be subject to detailed international law. Arms control and arms reduction  which have been a distant aspiration - the subject of many speeches over 40 years in this Hall - are now becoming a reality in Europe. Once the CFE treaty is signed  the summit in Paris can consider  and will consider  further ideas  including our own - about a new centre for reducing risks  about building confidence  about preventing conflict in Europe.Of course neither a centre nor a treaty will make conflict impossible. But I believe that every move we can make towards greater openness and honesty between nations makes it harder to envisage the kind of misunderstanding that could lead again to conflict in Europe. CFE  therefore  will be the stable footing on which the new European security structures can rest.Perhaps these structures are particularly important to Eastern Europe. Communism did not solve the old disputes in that part of our continent  but it put them to sleep. Now the imposed communist rule is disappearing and with it the anaesthetic which communist rule applied. We can hear again the murmur of some of those ancient disputes.Of course in Western Europe also used to have such disputes. French and Germans have fought each other three times in the last 120 years. Many of us were drawn in. No one would suppose that conceivable now. It is not that the nation states have disappeared; it is rather that new structures  like the European Community  are in place; it is rather that by statesmanship the poison of old disputes has been drained away. The friendship of France and Germany - of which Hans-Dietrich Genscher reminded us a few minutes ago - is an accomplished and welcome fact. Conflict over who should possess Alsace-Lorraine  for example is now impossible. We need to create that same certainty that conflict is impossible as regards all the other disputes which still persist to some extent in Europe. And not just in Europe. This is not just a European ambition. Once the Iraqis have been withdrawn from Kuwait  we will need to consider how lasting peace can be brought to the Middle East. And perhaps it is not too early to start thinking about how that long-term security can be achieved. Mr. Gianni De Michelis  speaking on behalf of the members of the European Community  put forward some thoughts on that subject  which I should like to echo. There is a need for a new and serious attempt to resolve the complex of Middle East disputes  including  se I have already mentioned  Palestine. There will also need to be a new security structure. This is 1990. It will be for the States in the region to decide how this should be done. It will be for them to take the initiative. Ho one will attempt to impose a system on them. But I believe the slow but steady progress of the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) may be useful to them. The CSCE process allows political dialogue and has established common principles ranging from respect for borders to human rights. There is transparency through confidence- and security-building measures. All of this gradually coming together in Europe has meant  and will mean I hope in the future  that States can increasingly trust each other and feel secure.This search for security is worldwide. The United Nations was formed to create and maintain such stability. Although the Charter of the United Nations was signed in San Francisco 45 years ago  the security mechanisms did not have the chance to work as intended. They were almost immediately frozen by the chill of the cold war. But just as the security mechanisms of the United Nations were early casualties of the cold war  so they have already proved to be one of the first beneficiaries of the thaw. After many years in which political divisions among the permanent members weakened the force of Security Council resolutions  the new unity of purpose which we see  and which we saw again yesterday  has given the Council unprecedented vigour. I worked here for four years as a junior member of my country's delegation in the 1950s and spent many hours in this Hall  some of them weary hours  some of them hours which  at the time  I must confess I thought were fairly pointless. I never expected to see such a healthy change in this building as a result of the developments of the last year.And I am not thinking only of the Security Council resolutions over Kuwait  although for the reasons I have given  they are crucial. There are other examples. In Namibia  which under the auspices of the United Nations was able last year to achieve peaceful independence and free elections. In Cambodia  the five permanent members have co-operated closely. Discussions were tough at times. They will be on such occasions  but agreement was reached at the end of August on a framework for a comprehensive political settlement. And on 9 and 10 September the Cambodian parties themselves endorsed this framework. I am well aware that a great deal of hard work and argument remain on the Cambodian question  but there is now a hope  a flickering hope  where once despair seemed total. The Secretary-General's mission o£ good offices in Cyprus continues  and it continues with our full support. It seems to us vital that all the parties should help him to reach a final settlement for that island.The United Nations must tackle the massive human problems which nation States and even regional groups cannot handle effectively by themselves. There is the menace of drugs  where the situation goes up and down  but on balance I believe continues to deteriorate. The work of the United Nations drugs units has been increasing to meet those demands  but more resources are required. Reform of the United Nations drug abuse control structure is essential. We believe the three existing drugs units should be unified into one streamlined structure under one senior full-time head  and I hope that at this session the General Assembly will be able' to take a decision along those lines. Then there are the hugely varied problems of our environment  the ozone layer  global warming  and many others. These are problems which have to be tackled  and quickly. But they can be tackled only if the world community acts together  and undoubtedly the United Nations and its agencies offer the best way of pooling these efforts. We make  and will continue to make  a serious contribution. It was yesterday in London that my Government published a White Paper outlining environmental policies for the 1990s  including the pledge to peg CO emissions by 2005 at 1990 levels.We must not forget  because of these relatively new problems  the battle against poverty. Britain has announced in the last week important new proposals on debt relief for the poorest countries  building on the earlier British initiative which led to the agreement of the ""Toronto terms"" in 1988. We have proposed that the Paris Club should improve its existing concessions by cancelling two thirds of a country's entire bilateral official debt. Repayment of the remainder would be tailored to match each country's improving debt service capacity over 25 years. To provide additional breathing space  there would be no payments during the first five years of this period. The conditions for qualifying for this relief would remain broadly the same as for the Toronto scheme.But it seems to me that  when all these other problems are considered and our energies devoted to them  it remains true that war is still the chief scourge of mankind  and following in the wake of war  the tragedies of famine and of refugees. Because that is so  peace-making and peace-keeping will stay at the heart of worthwhile international activity. They are the core of our work here. I hope that the United Nations benefits will be extended to all the people in the world who seek membership  and here I am thinking in particular of the people of Korea. I have tried briefly to sketch some of our own approaches and attitudes to these tasks in Britain. We try to bring practical realism to the tasks which I have outlined this morning. We know that past achievement does not guarantee future progress. It is far too soon to sit back and relax to the sound of our own self-congratulation. There is a huge amount to be done  and all of it is complicated  and much of it is daunting. But I am more hopeful than before that the international community  through the United Nations  is equal to the tasks. First  as I have said and for the reasons I have given  the new order must succeed in getting Iraq out of Kuwait  otherwise it will be stillborn and no one will take it seriously. But once that is done - and that will happen - I believe the new order  in its different shapes and different guises  will grow. I believe it will flourish  and I believe it will consolidate  so that the last decade of ...Ms century  the decade which we are now entering  may well turn out to be the safest and the most successful."
"55",2603,"GHA",45,1990,"﻿The close and cordial relations between Malta and my country give me added pleasure in conveying to the President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session the warm and sincere congratulations of the Ghana delegation on his unanimous election. My delegation looks forward with confidence to a rewarding and successful session under his able and distinguished leadership.L should like also to congratulate his immediate predecessor Major-General Joseph Garba  an illustrious son of Africa  on his outstanding contribution to the forty-fourth session.I should like to take this opportunity to welcome Liechtenstein into membership of the United Nations. The prospects for the universality of this Organisation being made complete in the near future are now bright indeed  and this is as it should be.The international political climate has taken a sudden  paradoxical and alarming twist as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Ghana had hoped that after eight years of wasteful war  attended by untold human suffering  the Gulf region would be spared another conflict. Unfortunately  that region's stability has once more been disturbed  and the threat of a wider conflict looms before us.The Government of Ghana has already issued a statement totally rejecting the use of force in international relations and underlining Ghana's commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes  in accordance with the United Nations Charter. We again call upon Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait unconditionally and to settle its differences with Kuwait through peaceful negotiations. We also appeal to all to exercise maximum restraint and to give dialogue and diplomatic effort a chance.The Gulf crisis points to other concerns  which are wider in their implications. The double standards  particularly on the part of the West  are as revealing as they are unacceptable. The willingness to rush into action at the annexation of Kuwait contrasts sharply with the condoning of and inaction over  Israel's occupation of Arab lands and with the benign neglect of Liberia. Again  for years  the Western countries have contended that economic sanctions would not work against South Africa. Suddenly  the same countries are eager to apply sanctions against Iraq.And it is difficult not to see the response to Iraq at least partly in terms of the consistent exploitation of the third world through strategies that ensure the supply of cheap raw materials to the Western industrialised countries. On the other hand  policies of oil-rich third world countries that have facilitated the injection of billions of dollars in investment in Western industrialised countries contrast sharply with the lack of adequate resources to enable many a third world country to meet the basic requirements of economic development. These considerations cannot be overlooked  and in the face of them a great dilemma is posed to many third world countries having to withstand high oil prices as a result of a prolonged sanctions policy against Iraq. A secure world order is possible only on the basis of a consistent commitment to principle and to social justice.The anxiety that has been displayed in respect of the Gulf crisis should be brought to bear also on Israel in the search for a solution to the Palestinian problem  which remains a major cause of instability in the Middle East. We reaffirm our support for the General Assembly's call for an international conference  under United Nations auspices  in which all parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  would participate on an equal footing to address the problem.In Cyprus  the rising tension between the two communities is a matter of concern to my delegation. We call upon the two communities to abandon mutual recriminations in favour of a more vigorous effort to promote reconciliation. In this regard  the Secretary-General's plan of action  aimed at assisting the two communities to reach a negotiated settlement  deserves a chance.Recent developments in other areas  however  have augured well. Improved East-Hast relations continue to strengthen the prospects for peace. The super-Power summit in Malta and Washington and the ongoing Vienna talks  which is resulted in significant troop reductions  have raised new hopes for peace and stability in Europe  thus putting an end to four decades of division and mistrust in that continent.We also welcome the recent Bush-Gorbachev agreement on the production of chemical weapons and on the destruction of their chemical-weapon stockpiles. It is the hope of my delegation that this agreement will provide the necessary impetus to the Geneva negotiations on nuclear weapons. As a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Protocol  Ghana shares the international concern over the use and spread of chemical weapons. We look forward to a comprehensive treaty that will command universal adherence.We hope that the lessons of the Vienna talks will not be lost on developing countries  much of whose expenditure on arms purchases  in our view  could have been channelled into socio-economic programmes to alleviate poverty and social hardship. Greater dedication to equity in north-South relations end observance of the principle of noa-inter£e7 nce in the internal affairs of member States  particularly the developing countries  would do much to encourage developing countries to exercise restraint in the acquisition of weapons. With regard to nuclear weapons  we are concerned at the slow progress of the ongoing negotiations after the encouraging start in 1988. Removing the threat of nuclear war  as stated by the General Assembly in the Final Document of the first special session devoted to disarmament  remains the most urgent task of our day. Once again  we call upon the super-Powers to redeem their pledge.By far the most significant import of improved East-West relations is the freedom and independence of East European countries and the forthcoming reunification of Germany. We hope that these developments will not open the door to internal instability  conflicts within and between those States arising out of ethnic rivalries and old boundary disputes. In a future of economic super-Powers  a reunited Germany would have pride of place  which should satisfy German sentiments and be a factor for peace. The free markets of Eastern Europe would  it is hoped  open further export opportunities for the third world countries  even though the greater competition for scarce Western resources will have an adverse impact on their development. Opportunities for educational facilities for nationals of third world countries and favourable economic and trade arrangements between those countries and the Eastern European countries appear to be in jeopardy. There is evidence o£ increased racism in the newly founded democracies of Eastern Europe  not to mention the possibility that East-West détente may threaten the efforts of third world countries to escape Western imperialism and neo-colonialism. So  while we welcome changes in Eastern Europe  we are also apprehensive about their impact upon the fortunes of the third world.The eighteenth special session on the drug crisis held last February  and the forthcoming World Summit for Children  the first ever  underscore the overwhelming desire that the United Nations should be a primary player in our common endeavour to address two gigantic human problems of our times. Reinvigorating the world body in the social area where  for so long  it has been only marginally effective  is an encouraging trend which my delegation supports. The carrying out of this and other crucial tasks  including peace-making and peace-keeping  however  demands a stronger and better-financed United Nations.It is  therefore  a matter of regret that  despite the implementation of almost all of the budgetary and administrative reforms recommended by the 1985 Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts  the United Nations continues to face serious financial problems owing to the withholding of assessed contributions by some Member States. We call upon those withholding assessed contributions to comply with the financial requirements of membership.My delegation welcomes the positive impetus to the Cambodian peace process in the shape of the new United Nations peace plan  which offers a framework for a comprehensive settlement aimed at ending the civil war in Cambodia. My delegation is also encouraged by reports about plans for a new political order that would end outside arms supplies to the warring Afghan factions and set up an impartial electoral process. We are equally encouraged by the positive developments in the Iran-Iraq peace process since the last session  particularly by concessions made by Iraq leading towards direct negotiations by the two countries and the repatriation of several thousands of prisoners of war. We call upon all the parties concerned and the international community to lend their fullest co-operation to these various peace process.We have followed positive trends in other parts of the world closely. The Republic of Yemen  which we welcome  is being represented here for the first time by one delegation. German reunification and the Roh-Gorbachev exploratory talks held in San Francisco in June 1990 have had their impact on the Korean peninsula  where discussions between delegations from North and South Korea and the exchange of top-level visits are increasing  λ resolve by both Koreas to settle their differences is the most secure basis for peace in the Korean peninsula. As sovereign independent States  either the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or the Republic of Korea  or both  are entitled to be admitted into the United Nations. It would be better still if by agreement between them they could follow the example of Yemen.I would now like to turn to the African continent  where the global drive for peace has received a serious set-back through the current conflict in Liberia. Ghana and five other sister member countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) were compelled to send peace-keeping troops to Liberia in the context of the cease-fire monitoring group established at the end of the Banjul Summit on 7 August 1990 to stop the carnage and the destruction of property in that country. We appeal to all people of good will to extend support to the ECOWAS effort.We would also appeal for early resumption of peace talks in Mozambique and Angola.The adoption by the Security Council on 27 June 1930 of the Secretary-General's implementation plan on Western Sahara marks a significant step forward on the tortuous journey towards the settlement of the Western Sahara conflict. We call upon all parties to extend maximum co-operation in the implementation of the plan.The road ahead for the realisation of the General Assembly's objective of a non-racial democratic South Africa continues to be fraught with difficulties despite recent encouraging developments in southern Africa. As the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its resumed forty-fourth session shows  the political guidelines set forth in the 14 December 1989 Declaration are far from being  et by South Africa. The report is timely  particularly in the light of current attempts being made by Pretoria and by some Members of the United Nations towards the lifting of sanctions against South Africa.Responsible public leaders and organizations including the Commonwealth Committee of five Foreign Ministers and the July 1990 Summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  have strongly urged that sanctions against South Africa should be maintained and strengthened. The truth of the matter is that there has been little progress towards dismantling apartheid. Meanwhile  rights   elements and the security forces are fuelling conflict and carnage among blacks as a way of reversing the prospects for progress. Until there is clear evidence of an irreversible move for dismantling apartheid  the international community should continue to maintain the pressure on South Africa in the form of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions.The global economic situation continues to be a source of concern to several developing countries  including mine. For sub-Saharan Africa  in particular  it is the same tragic tale of economic stagnation and declining living conditions  despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by several countries.We appreciate the good will and practical support extended to Africa by the international community but move needs to be done. We recognise that  in the foreseeable future  Africa will require substantial external assistance to supplement its own efforts.But Africa requires the understanding by its development partners of the cultural environment in which the reform programmes must be implemented. It is important to stress this point in order to drive home some fundamental truths about the African situation particularly is the light of the emerging views about new political conditionalities for extending assistance to Africa. This is not the time to widen the web of conditionalities particularly if this will lead to the imposition of political concepts and constitutional processes that will undermine national unity and stability. It is rather the time to adopt realistic attitudes toward redressing the unfavourable international environment in particular problems of falling commodity prices  debt-servicing burdens  high interest rates and protectionism  which continue to undermine reform efforts of African Governments.In the area of trade  developing countries continue to suffer from adverse terms of trade. While developing countries under their various restructuring programmes have liberalised their economies  the developed countries have given in to protectionist pressures and resorted increasingly to managed trade  as exemplified by the growing volume of voluntary export restraints  orderly marketing arrangements and bilateral agreements limiting trade. The international trading system  founded on the principle of non-discrimination  is littered with discriminatory arrangements. The 1980s have also seen the Magnitude of the external debt of developing countries grow in volume to the level of $1.3 trillion  of which Africa bears over $250 billion  with the debt still rising on account of rising interest rates and rescheduling. As the Secretary-General's Expert Group on Africa's commodity problems points out in its report  rescheduling of debt unaccompanied by debt write-down  can lead to increased overall debt. Although there has been so   progress in debt relief under the Toronto Agreement on the Paris Club debt; the impact has been inadequate both in scope and implementation. My delegation  therefore  wholeheartedly endorses the recommendations of the Secretary-General's Expert Group on Africa's debt  particularly those regarding increased efforts to reduce both the debt stock and the debt service; the granting of further relief by moving beyond the terns of the Toronto initiative in respect of the remaining Paris Club debt; and the availability of a moratorium of 3 to 10 years with interest charged at International Development Association (XDA) rates and the resources cost not deducted from aid allocations. My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate its call for an international conference on Africa's debt.The flow of resources so critical to the long-term development needs of developing countries has been considerably reduced. The commercial banks are still reluctant to resume lending to highly indebted countries as their credit worthiness has been seriously eroded by the twin problems of external indebtedness and adverse terns of trade. Many low-income countries depend on official development assistance (ODA) for external finance to support their development programmes. But ODA flows have stagnated in real terms. Few industrialised countries have attained the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) in ODA flows to developing countries. In the face of the resource squeeze  structural adjustment programmes mounted by most African countries within the framework of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 have had short-term perspective as the necessary resource to support growth-oriented policies have not been forthcoming.In calling for a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the revitalisation of economic growth and development  in particular in the developing countries the Group of 77 had expected purposeful and decisive international action to address the major constraints militating against their economic growth. But in the end consensus could be achieved only on the basis of bland assurances promising more of the same failed policies. For developing countries this was a disappointment. The international ""community missed a good opportunity to demonstrate its political will to find a lasting solution to some of the intractable problems confronting the developing world today.Instead refuge was sought in calls for democratic reform. In the 1980s the call was for economic reform. Developing countries followed the prescriptions for structural adjustment and yet continued to suffer economic malaise of a more virulent kind. Naturally they began to question the policy prescriptions and their underlying assumptions. The Economic Commission for Africa's alternative framework for structural adjustment should have been a welcome contribution to the debate. However instead of its promoting a vigorous debate on and critical analysis of the reasons why economic reforms were not yielding the expected results the focus quickly shifted from the need for economic reform to the lack of democratic reform as the primary constraint against economic recovery and development in the developing countries. Democratic reform has thus become the clarion call at the beginning of the 1990s.I should like to address that question  as it is important to make the position of the Ghana Government quite clear. Implicit in the new clarion call is the statement that the political system of the developing countries are somehow flawed and perhaps Western-style political institutions are what is required to lift the developing countries out of their economic plight. Let me say unequivocally that we cherish the ideals of democracy. Our argument is that political institutions must be rooted in the culture and experience of the society concerned not in an alien culture.This  position is reflected in Ghana in the sound beginning which we have already made towards representative government through the establishment of district assembly  elected freely by secret ballot from multiple candidates.These assemblies constitute the vehicles for participation  at the grass-roots level  in decision-making. We are taking the process further by conducting national consultations on a future political system for our country. These consultations and the consensus emerging there from will fashion a system of government at the national level which rests on our value goals  particularly stability and national unity  and is rooted in our culture.But no political system  however representative or democratic  can thrive in the face of grinding poverty and dependency. The experience of many countries demonstrates that democratic reform without economic justice sounds hollow to those ravaged by hunger  disease  illiteracy and misery. Freedom from want is as basic в human right as the right to choose the political system under which one lives.Believing as it does in the promotion of  and respect for  human rights  the Government of Ghana ha· signed and ratified various international human rights instruments at the global and regional levels covering a wide range of rights and freedoms of the individual and of peoples. These include the Convention on the Sights of the Child  which my country was the first Member State to ratify in furtherance of its resolve to protect and promote the rights of children  and the African Charter of Human and People's Rights which addresses the peculiar socio-cultural and economic considerations pertaining to African peoples. Equally important is the reflection of our commitment in our domestic policies and legislation.The Government of Ghana looks forward to participating actively and constructively in the international Conference on Environment and Development which will be held in Brazil in 1992  for which the preparatory work has already begun. It is our hope that all aspects of environmental protection and preservation will be considered  including issues relating to the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and resources in support of the sustainable development of the developing countries.In conclusion  the poverty and declining living standards of Africa remain a major challenge to the international community. The objective of global peace will continue to be illusory as long as this challenge is unmet. The 19808 were characterised as the lost decade for development. At the dawn of the 1990s let us pledge together to avoid such a mockery of the closing decade of this century through our common and renewed endeavour to enhance the quality of life of the vast majority of the peoples of our planet. Collectively we have the capacity and the resources. We must match that capacity and those resources with our collective will."
"56",2649,"GIN",45,1990,"﻿Once again  I have the pleasure of addressing this distinguished Assembly to transmit to it the heartfelt and warm greetings of the people and the Government of the Republic of Guinea  as well as those of its President  General Lansana Conté.I should like  first of all  to congratulate you. Sir  on your brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session and  at the same time  to express my conviction that your human qualities  competence and outstanding diplomatic experience  will surely make our work completely successful. For that reason  I can assure you of my delegation's complot· co-operation in the accomplishment of the delicate and very important task unanimously entrusted to him.I also pay tribute to his predecessor  the distinguished representative of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  Mr. Joseph Garba  for the effectiveness and perseverance with which he conducted the work of the forty-fourth session and of the sixteenth  seventeenth and eighteenth special sessions of the General Assembly.Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  Secretary-General of our Organization  has  during the past few years  exerted tireless efforts which have given our Organisation greater credibility and prestige. Such devotion to the service of peace and progress  inspired by eminent human qualities  deserves our heartfelt and warm congratulations. I take this opportunity to welcome the admission of Liechtenstein as a new Member of the United Nations.Since our last session  the world has changed radically. This momentous process  which has taken place in the space of one year  will undoubtedly continue.A few years ago  the bipolarity in East-West relations had already begun to wane because  thanks to our efforts at reflection and concerted action. Intransigent ideological positions had gradually yielded to co-operation.Today the major upheavals occurring throughout the world are revealing a new trend  the pressure for democracy  which brings a new reality to the struggle for the creation of a new and fair international order based on the interdependence of nations.In this new International context  the search for solutions to the major challenges before us will be Inspired by the need to continue the dialogue which was begun three years ago in order to enhance international relations  to control events that are taking place at too feet a pace and to look to the future with assurance and a spirit of solidarity.In the course of the past year  three main facts have characterised the international situation. First  the unswerving will of States to resolve conflicts has been In evidence and is growing stronger. Secondly  constructive dialogue between North and South  made possible by the adoption of the Declaration on International Economic Co-operation opens new prospects for more effective structures of international economic co-operation. Thirdly'  the crisis created in the Persian Gulf  following the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq  constitutes the discordant note in the maintenance of peace and respect for international law. While most of the events that have been upsetting our world are fortunately  on their way to resolution  it none the less regains true that the complete elimination of all the existing hotbeds of crisis requires more comprehension and sacrifice.On the African continent  the successful implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) led to the independence of Namibia  which we joyfully admitted to our Organisation last April as a new Member. That historic event shows how well-founded multilateral action is  and attests to a people's determination to break the yoke of foreign domination. If that young State is to be rebuilt  it will need sizeable resources  which the international community must provide.In South Africa  recent positive developments enable us to look to the future with optimism. In fact  the release on 11 February 1990 of Nelson Mandela  the symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle; the beginning of a dialogue between the leaders of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pretoria Government; and the recent opening up of Mr. De Klerk's Party to people of colour are all encouraging signs in the anti-apartheid struggle.None the less  these qualitative changes that have taken place in South Africa should make us even more vigilant  because if we are not careful the peace initiative designed to create a democratic  multi-racial South Africa could be jeopardised by violent delaying tactics on the part of forces opposed to the eradication of apartheid. While we await the completion of the negotiation process now under way  my delegation is convinced of the effectiveness of comprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa in overcoming the intransigence of the advocates of the anachronistic system of apartheid.On the question of Western Sahara  the Republic of Guinea appreciates the mediation of the Secretary-General  whose activities in connection with this case have led to significant and hopeful developments. The implementation of Security Council resolution 621 (1988)  authorising the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative for the Western Sahara  justifies our conviction in this respect.It is comforting to note  furthermore  that the winds of peace are now blowing over other areas of conflict in Africa  where reconciliation seems to be the leitmotiv of all actions under way  be they in Angola  Mozambique or the Horn of Africa.The same peace process is awaited in the conflict between Chad and Libya  which have decided to bring their dispute before the International Court of Justice.In connection with the Comorian Island of Mayotte  we have every reason to hope that the initiatives undertaken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations will rapidly lead to a negotiated solution acceptable to the two parties.The situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian problem have already been the subject of many resolutions in which we have repeatedly condemned the usurpation of occupied Arab lands  as well as the suffering caused by the tragedy of a Lebanon in flames. We have recognized that an international conference remains the framework and the option most certain to extinguish those flames.We express our firm support for the legitimacy of the Palestinian cause. None the less  while the proclamation of the independent State of Palestine and the peace initiatives by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had seemed to be a glimmer of hope on the horizon  the sky of negotiation now seems to be darkened by clouds.Indeed  the systematic settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied Arab territories  the obstinacy of the extremist wing of the Israeli Government  and the present break in the dialogue between the PLO and the United States are matters of concern to my Government. My delegation  while agreeing that Israel matt exist as a sovereign State  also recognises the new independent State of Palestine  whose right to territory and to sovereignty Must be preserved.While the international community welcomes the fortunate outcome of the Iran-Iraq conflict  illustrated very recently by the spectacular withdrawal of Iraqi troops and the exchange of prisoners  it is none the less highly concerned over the explosive situation created in the Gulf region by the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq. That annexation violates the provisions of the Charter. My country supports all the resolutions adopted by the Security Council on this question and demands the unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi armed forces from Kuwait to the internationally recognized borders  and the return to power of the legitimate Government of the Emirate.The situation in Asia  in general terms  is also highly disquieting ail entails further threats to international peace and security.The cessation of hostilities end the initiation of a dialogue between Afghans  in accordance with the Geneva Agreements  will facilitate the repatriation of all Afghans and their social reintegration into a united and prosperous nation.In respect of Cambodia  any approach to the question should entail an overall political settlement that can bring that country a just and lasting peace. To that end  my Government supports the measures for stability taken by the five permanent members of the Security Council in the framework of the guest for a solution involving the various parties  without foreign interference. My delegation supports the Plan of the Five dated 31 August 1990  and especially the establishment of a Supreme National Council presided over by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. In the courageous legitimate struggle being waged by the Korean people  North and South should continue the dialogue that has now begun  in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of their homeland through the creation of a single  confederal State which will be a Member of the United Nations.Cyprus is also trying to bring its two communities together. The United Nations  through its Secretary-General  is making efforts in that direction. But the situation remains unchanged.My delegation has been following closely the democratic developments that have taken place in most of the countries of Central America - a region which has been the victim of such tragic upheavals  bringing peace to Nicaragua has certainly given an impetus to efforts to relieve tension and achieve national reconciliation and development without foreign interference.The future of the Malvinas Islands must be forged by peaceful means  on the basis of negotiations between the parties with strict respect for the Charter.With the disquieting persistence of certain hotbeds of tension  general and complete disarmament under effective international control remains a categorical imperative. The feeling that peace has finally been achieved is sometimes dispelled by an atmosphere of distrust or overt hostility here and there.It is true that significant progress has been achieved in negotiations between the two super-Powers. Despite advances towards the conclusion of a convention on chemical and biological weapons  we find the multilateral talks proceeding rather slowly. The well-established triangular relationship between disarmament  development and security remains very timely in a period of acute crisis and deprivation when material and financial resources must be mobilised and directed towards development. As I have often stressed from this rostrum  development must be the collective endeavour of mankind - in other words  the shared responsibility of States. Faced with the frightful throat of a nuclear holocaust  political leaders  scientists  religious authorities and non-governmental organisations should all share in the building of peace and international security.My country abhors war  regardless of its cause. In this respect I should like to share with those present here the wisdom of a famous French cabaret singer who believes that ""nothing is more beautiful than a rusty rifle"".In the real contemporary world - above all during the last decade - economics have an impact on politics. The enormous changes that have taken place in East-West relations and the democratic awakening of peoples have created conditions conducive to the establishment of more harmonious international economic and social relations. The developing countries  which must draw the appropriate lessons from the impact of these changes and benefit from their consequences  are somewhat optimistic because of the adoption at the eighteenth special session  last April  of the Declaration on the economic growth and development of the third-world countries. That proved again that with a Measure of real political will the nations of the world can engage in sincere and constructive dialogue. Such dialogue is all the more necessary since various development decades have failed  since the North-South dialogue needs to be given new vigour  since a new international development strategy for the period 1991 to 2000 needs to be formulated  and since the third world in general and Africa in particular are suffering greatly from the world economic crisis  whose consequences are compounded by natural disasters and underdevelopment.On the subject of those countries  the poor countries should  without disregarding co-operation with the industrialised countries  promote South-South co-operation as an adjunct to North-South co-operation and as a special tool for ensuring collective self-reliance and self-sufficiency in food. In that context  the Cyprus initiative and the Cairo political declaration on eliminating hunger throughout the world can be useful in guiding our various development activities.The development crisis  which has been particularly harsh on the least developed countries  is the result of well-known internal and external causes. The recent Paris Conference highlighted these. The attainment of a new international economic order remains vital.Debt continues to weigh heavily on the development activities of the poorest countries. In that connection  while we appreciate certain instances of debt rescheduling agreed to by friendly countries  we consider that assistance to poor countries must be based on the following principles! reduction and even elimination of interest; extension of the repayment period  taking into account such country's capacity to pay; refinancing loans made under market conditions by multilateral organisations; and increased official development assistance to the least developed countries. The magnitude of the crisis is such that creditors should be more sensitive to the disturbing situation debtor countries. I wish now to address problems of the environment. There is no doubt that there is a symbiotic relationship between those problems and development. For the Republic of Guinea  the question of the environment should not be viewed solely from the standpoint of efforts to remedy the harmful consequences of human activity for the ecosystem. It has another dimensions implementation of a policy for organising production without causing irreparable damage to nature and for foreseeing natural disasters that can disturb the ecological balance and jeopardise development. For example  ongoing collective measures should be devised with respect to drought  desertification  acid rain  deforestation  earthquakes and flooding.The trans-boundary movement and dumping of wastes are a dangerous scourge that calls for a vigorous reaction from the international community. I cannot stress enough the need for further negotiations on a convention on this subject that can be ratified unanimously by all States. In that connection  my delegation welcomes the organisation of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in 1992.We also appreciate the decision taken at the last session  which mandated the Director-General of the United Nations Environment Programme. in co-operation with the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organisation  to make preparations for the speedy negotiation of a convention on climate.An examination of the world social situation underscores the real development problems of the poor countries. Must we not find ways to reconcile the needs of structural adjustment with those of social stability? At this session the Assembly will place special emphasis on ways and means to overcome the dangerous social effects of structural adjustment programmes. Furthermore  in official development assistance  key sectors such as education and health suffer because of the priority given to profit-generating activities. We therefore need a strategy adapted to national realities  to give a human face to structural adjustment.It is also absolutely necessary to integrate women and young people into the development process in the third world. The rural exodus can be prevented only through a policy of supporting community projects.The abuse of drugs and narcotic substances requires intensified international co-operation on concerted world action in the war against the production  sale and use of drugs. The effectiveness of our struggle against this scourge depends also on the eradication of the laundering of drug money.My delegation welcomed the conclusions reached at the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders  held at Havana.On the subject of human rights I wish to refer to the process of democratisation now under way in my country. But first  I want to reaffirm the international community's obligation to promote a now humanitarian order  for our era displays an unprecedented interest in universal human values. That is why since 2 October 1989 the national authorities of the Republic of Guinea  in accordance with commitments made six years ago  have been developing a new basic law that will enshrine the state of law so much desired by the people of Guinea. That basic law  which is now on the drawing-board  demonstrates the commitment of the National Military Correcting Committee to democracy and to the values it espouses. The basic law includes a true charter of human rights  by which Guinea reaffirms its international conception of rights through adherence to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and Peoples. Rights. By virtue of its provisions  any Guinean will be able to count on the application of those tests  which will become an integral part of our Constitution. The lofty task of democratization has suddenly had to confront the tragic events in Liberia. Since December  that fraternal country has been plagued by bloody fratricidal confrontations that have done immeasurable harm to the social and economic life of countries bordering Liberia. The crisis in Liberia has caused total political destabilisation exacerbated by serious differences among groups and movements  which has plunged the country into genocide and material destruction.To restore national peace and harmony  the Economic Community of west African States (ECOWAS) has  as members know  developed a peace plan involving the sending of a subregional buffer force charged with ensuring the unconditional observance of the cease-fire.My delegation believes that a just and equitable solution of the conflict must involve the co-ordination of a national agreement including all players in the political game. My delegation invites the international community to support the efforts of ECOWAS permanent mediation committee to restore peace  democracy and national reconciliation in that fraternal country.Guinea has on many occasions stated its position and its concerns on the conflict in Liberia. It has indicated  inter alia  that it is not a question of supporting one faction or one man against the others  but of creating the conditions for dialogue leading to reconciliation among all Liberians.The conflict has had consequences for Guinea  including demographic disturbances resulting from the massive influx of more than 380 000 refugees. Such a sudden and great concentration of people results in considerable sacrifices for the local population and for the Government.Despite substantial assistance from the international community through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the problems posed by the refugees are far from being solved  for the following reasons. First  thus far there has been only short-torn assistance to refugees  and we see no happy outcome to that situation. To reach such an outcome  we must draw on the basic principle of the right of voluntary individual return for refugees. Secondly  the local people who have generously opened their doors and their food stocks are today even poorer than the refugees  as they have been hit with sudden rises in food prises. And thirdly  many disturbances have resulted from this huge immigration both in economic and social structures and in the areas of health share and ecological balance  against the backdrop of disruption of the normal networks for production and trade in south-eastern Guinea. My government appeals urgently to the international community as a whole to consider not only emergency aid but also medium-term and long-term assistance to the refugees and to the populations that have welcomed them.The qualitative improvement in the international climate following the important changes that have taken place in many countries enhances the constructive role of our Organisation in the relaxation of regional conflicts and in the struggle for the building of a more prosperous world. In this complex network of change  the human being  his aspirations and his future must occupy pride of place.Growing awareness of our interdependence confers on multilateralism new responsibilities and new prospects. It is within that interdependence that we may find the hidden key to our success and the very foundations of our future.As we approach the end of the century  when peoples are breaking down ideological barriers and demolishing the bastions of arbitrariness  under the thrust of democracy a new civilisation based on co-operation and realism will emerge from the ruins of the old. The people of Guinea would give anything to see the birth of that new civilisation which will bring new hope and certainty to our hearts mid minds."
"57",2688,"GMB",45,1990,"﻿I should like first of all to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your election is a well-deserved recognition of your personal qualities and record of great distinction  as well as a fitting tribute to the role and stature of your country  Malta  in world affairs. My delegation is confident that under your presidency the forty-fifth session will make a decisive contribution to the promotion of world peace and security. While wishing you all success  I wish to assure you of my delegation's full support and co-operation throughout the session.I should also like to place on record our sincere appreciation and thanks to your predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria  for the exemplary manner in which he directed the work of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.I also wish to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts geared towards achieving durable solutions to the numerous and seemingly intractable conflicts that threaten international peace and security. Let me also use this opportunity to welcome in our midst the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Republic of Namibia. The admission of Namibia into the comity of nations after decades of struggle against the illegal occupation of the country by South Africa is an occasion for self-congratulation by the United Nations  which had persistently championed the cause of freedom and independence for Namibia.Twelve months ago a wave of optimism was blowing through this Hall when delegation after delegation hailed the new era of rapprochement. Détente and co-operation among nations  particularly between the two super-Powers. That optimism had since been validated by the agreements between the United States of America and the Soviet Union to reduce their stockpiles of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and to work towards resolving regional conflicts that threaten world peace and security.But today the optimism end hopes of 12 months ago have been replaced by fear that the world is on the edge of a precipice. There is a serious danger of an eruption that can engulf many countries with military destruction and cause severe disruptions to the economies of all countries the world over. I am of course referring to the crisis in the Gulf region caused by the brutal and unprovoked invasion by Iraq of the small State of Kuwait.The Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait constitute naked aggression and a flagrant violation of the basic principles of civilized behaviour. It is  indeed  disheartening that  as we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century  a country in dealing with its neighbours would resort to practices and actions that are reminiscent of the Dark Ages by using brute force to try to subdue and eradicate a weaker neighbour. Those practices are abominable and in this day and age unacceptable to the international community. The Gambia therefore condemns the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq  and from this rostrum I would like to renew our call for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait ^id the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait. The tragic developments in the Gulf region have caused dismay and anxiety in the entire international community and  without a doubt  constitute a threat to world peace and security.The response of the United Nations system to the crisis in the Gulf region has been laudable and the unanimity or near-unanimity on the various resolutions adopted by the Security Council augurs well for the United Nations as the only machinery for the maintenance of peace and security and for ensuring that all countries conform to acceptable patterns of behaviour in inter-State relations. With renewed optimism and faith in the relevance and role of the United Nations system  my delegation hopes that progress will be made in the resolution of long-standing disputes and conflicts that have long beset the international community.The Middle East remains an area of tension with the question of Palestine as the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The people of Palestine continue to languish without a homeland of their own. Israel  in flagrant defiance of the international community  continues to consolidate its hold on the occupied Arab territories.No positive developments have taken place since the Palestinian people  in the face of oppressive measures by Israel  decided in December 1987 to launch the heroic intifidah and thereafter  out of sheer good will  made many concessions in the search for genuine peace and security. In this regard we cannot but remain deeply concerned over the continued denial by Israel - in spite o£ General Assembly and Security Council resolutions - of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independent nationhood. He therefore share the belief that a just and comprehensive settlement resides in the speedy convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  under United Nations auspices  with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/50 C.For a long time the situation in South Africa has been in the forefront of main concerns of the United Nations. It is a fact that a glimmer of hope had been generated by the measures taken last February by President De Klerk  including the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  as well as the partial lifting of the state of emergency. The commencement of a dialogue between the South African authorities and the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) is another development that offers a reel opportunity that could lead to a negotiated settlement.It must be emphasised  however  that recent developments are just a beginning and that A lot more remains to be done to reverse the situation in South Africa  for the main pillars of apartheid remain intact despite the apparent show of good WÍ72 to move away from that criminal and violent system. It is for this reason that sanctions and other pressures which have so far succeeded in compelling the Pretoria regime to make concessions should be maintained and intensified. My delegation believes that it would be premature to relax tensions at this stage as that would send the wrong signals and abort the process towards negotiations which has already commenced. As stated is the Harare Declaration  sanctions and over pressures against the apartheid regime must be maintained until change is clearly irreversibly secured and a non-racial  united and democratic society is established in South Africa.It is  however  unfortunate that the process towards dismantling the system of apartheid seems threatened by an upsurge in violence between rival black organisations in South Africa. That state of affairs will not only divert attention from the main struggle against а common enemy  but can also play into the bands of those who are bent on perpetuating racism and the exploitation of the black man in South Africa. My delegation therefore appeals to all progressive and democratic forces in South Africa to put an end to the internecine violence that threatens to derail the campaign for the total eradication of apartheid.Elsewhere in the African continent we are faced with a very serious situation in the Republic of Liberia  where a civil war erupted in December last year. The international community has watched with horror and dismay the degeneration of the conflict into tribal warfare with massive destruction of property and the massacre of thousands of civilians  some of whom had sought sanctuary in churches  hospitals and diplomatic missions. The civil war has also trapped thousands of foreign nationals without any means of escape or protection.The result of all this has been a state of anarchy and a total breakdown of law and order. These developments have traumatized the Liberian population and greatly shocked the people of the subregion and led to hundreds of thousands of Liberians being displaced and made refugees in neighbouring countries.The last summit of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  which mat in Banjul  the Gambia  last May  reviewed the situation in Liberia and expressed grave concern over the conflict and called on all parties concerned to agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities. At the same time  the Authority established an ECOWAS Standing Mediation Committee as an instrument for encouraging the peaceful settlement of disputes in the subregion.Soon after the May summit and with the situation in Liberia rapidly deteriorating  the Chairman of the Authority  Alhaji Sir Dewda Rairaba Jawara  President of the Gambia  convened a meeting of the Mediation Committee at the ministerial level  and after all parties to the conflict had indicated their acceptance of mediation by ECOHAS a series of meetings were held in Freetown  Republic of Sierra Leone  to try to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Liberia. Despite the great effort made at the various meetings at the ministerial level  it did not produce the result desired by the people of Liberia and the international community.It is against that background that the Heads of State and Government of the ECOWAS Standing Mediation Committee met in Banjul in August where they decided to assume their responsibility of ensuring that peace and stability was maintained within the subregion  for they believed that the tragic situation in Liberia posed a threat to the peace and stability of the area. The outcome of the deliberations was the ECOWAS peace plan which has three basic elements: first  the observance of a cease-fire by all the parties to the conflict; secondly  the establishment of a cease-fire monitoring group (ECOMOG) to supervise and ensure compliance with the cease-fire; and  thirdly  the formation of an interim government to administer the country and organise free and fair elections under international supervision leading to a democratically elected government.When the Committee met and adopted those proposals  every Member State of ECOHAS was duly informed and requested to support the initiative. There were no contrary views at that time. It must also be pointed out that at the time of adoption of the peace package to which I have referred  two of the warring parties had accepted both a cease-fire and a peace-keeping force. Thus  the ECOMOG force was sent to Liberia after the acceptance of the cease-fire and it was only against that background and in view of the rapidly deteriorating situation that ECOMOG went in. It must however be made very clear that the situation would have been far worse if nothing had been done at the time. In other words  the effect of not doing something would have been disastrous. Since the arrival of the ECOMOG force thousands of foreign nationals have been evacuated  a hospital rehabilitated and relief supplies made available to the population. At about the same time as ECOMOG was deployed  a national conference of all Liberian political parties  professional and other interested groups was held in Banjul from 27 August to 4 September to deliberate on the crisis in Liberia and to establish an interim government. And it should be noted that this conference was attended only by Liberians and its deliberations were conducted solely by Liberians. The representation at the national conference was broad-based and two of the warring factions took part in the deliberations. After six __ of extensive discussions and negotiations  the conference established an Interim Government of National Unity comprising representatives of a cross-section of the entire Liberian population and provided openings for the participation of groups which had net even attended the national conference. After the national conference  a delegation of the Interim Government was dispatched to meet the warring faction which refused to take part in the deliberations  with a view to persuading them to accept and participate in the Interim Government. For this reason the composition of the Interim Government has not been officially announced pending the outcome of these consultations.At the level of ECOWAS  there have been calls for the convening of an extraordinary summit. The Gambia as Chairman has no objection to the holding of an extraordinary summit but  according to the ECOWAS rules of procedure  a majority of two-thirds of the members is required before an extraordinary summit is convened. The Chairman of the Authority is currently carrying out consultations with his colleagues on this issue  and an extraordinary summit will be convened soon after and the required number of countries have indicated their consent.ECOMOG has now embarked on its important and historic mission and it is concerned not only with enforcing the cease-fire  but also with ensuring that the necessary conditions are created for much-needed humanitarian assistance to reach the people of Liberia. I therefore wish to make a solemn appeal to all Liberians  especially the leaders of the warring factions  to co-operate with the ECOMOG force and to give it all the assistance and co-operation it needs in the fulfilment of its mission. Similarly  I wish  on behalf of the Chairman of the Authority of ECOWAS  to appeal to all countries that have any influence on the national Patriotic Front of Liberia to urge the leadership of that group to join their fellow Liberians in the ongoing dialogue aimed at implementing the ECOWAS peace plan formulated in Banjul so that the suffering of the people of Liberia can be brought to an end and peace and stability restored in Liberia.It is also our fervent hope that the international community  particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity  will continue to support the BCOHAS peace plan  which is the only viable alternative to continued bloodshed and destruction of property. I also wish  on behalf of ECOWAS  to appeal to the entire international community to contribute to the Special Fund for ECOMOG Operations in Liberia as well as to respond generously and expeditiously to the various appeals by the Chairman of the Authority of ECOWAS for the provision of humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines to the suffering peoples of Liberia.Only a few days ago we witnessed the reunification of Germany  which indeed is the final act announcing the end of the cold war. We congratulate the German people on this historic occasion and hope that it will usher in a new era of peace  understanding and closer co-operation in Europe and beyond.The Gambia welcomes the current efforts of the two Koreas geared towards the speedy reunification of that divided country in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of their peoples. It is the view of the Gambia that the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations  in accordance with the principle of universality  will facilitate the eventual peaceful reunification of North and South Korea. With regard to Afghanistan  we are deeply distressed that despite of the withdrawal of foreign troops the situation remains charged with tension affecting international peace and stability. We therefore urge all the parties concerned to abide by the Geneva Agreements and make every effort in the guest for a peaceful settlement of their differences.Although the international political scene has been showing SOME positive trends  we are very Much concerned that international economic prospects remain somewhat bleak. Slow or negative growth and the persisting debt problem  are causing a further deterioration in the quality of life in developing countries. Despite a healthy 3.6 per cent growth in industrialised countries in 1989  external imbalances remain critical. Growth in developing countries slowed to 3.3 per cent in 1989  compared to the decade's 4.3 per cent average. Present international economic and trade arrangements  fluctuating commodity prices and unresolved monetary issues perpetuate severe inequalities and continue to promote an unfair and inequitable transfer of resources from the developing countries to developed countries. Many governments have undertaken structural reforms in order to revitalise their economies but their efforts have been impeded by severe social and political obstacles  as amply highlighted in the consensus Declaration adopted by the General Assembly's eighteenth special session.The development crisis is dramatised by the plight of the least developed countries  which have been facing formidable structural difficulties end experiencing extreme deterioration in their overall socio-economic situation. The targets set out in the Substantial New Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly in 1981 have not been attained. In this connection  we would like to underscore the significance of enhanced international efforts to reactivate growth and development in the least developed countries. We fully support the recommendations of the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris last month  aimed at assisting these countries to place their economies on the path of sustained growth and development.The development and protection of children are other important issues on the global agenda. She Gambia  at the very onset  fully endorsed the initiative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UMXC8F) for convening the World Summit for Children this year. May I therefore take this opportunity to extend our congratulations to the organisers for the success of the Summit  at which the Gambia was represented by a high-level delegation led by President Jawara  whose Government’s solemn commitment to accord the highest priority to the protection of the rights of the child and the mother is well known.We therefore remain hopeful that the adoption of the historic Declaration of the Summit and of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child will undoubtedly lead to and enhance the development and protection of the rights and needs of children.The issue of human rights t has assumed great importance and prominence in world affairs. We in the Gambia have always been deeply rooted in our declared commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We cannot therefore remain indifferent to the violations to which these rights are being subjected in other parts of the world. In view of the widening gap between the universally accepted norms of human rights and the stark reality in many parts of the world  the Gambia  motivated purely by special concern for the individual and his freedom and dignity  holds the considered view that a world-wide and forceful campaign should be mounted with the support of the appropriate United Nations machinery to intensify our efforts in order to achieve a better and more effective compliance with the generally accepted norms in the field of human rights. In this regard  specific steps within each region should be encouraged towards the institutionalisation of the observance and enforcement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.In the same vein  the Gambia would like to register its total support for the convening of a world conference on human rights in accordance with decision 1990 110 of the Hunan Sights Commission. The Gambia Government  meanwhile  will continue to co-operate fully with the human rights agencies within the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)·We would in this context like to acknowledge with deep appreciation the assistance being rendered by the United Nations Commission on Human Sights to the African Centre for Democracy and Human Sights Studies  which since its establishment has actively collaborated with the African Commission on Hunan and People's Sights  as well as to those who share the Gambia's concerns for respect and protection of both individual and collective liberties. Furthermore  my delegation would also like to renew its support for the proposal made by the Federal Republic of Germany last year to appoint a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Sights.Let me now conclude my statement. As we draw closer to the advent of the twenty-first century mankind is witnessing a unique period in relations among States  a period of peace characterised by international co-operation and solidarity. The emerging order  however  appears to be limited so far to international political relations. My delegation is concerned that this dynamic process will be incomplete if it is not accompanied by profound changes in international economic relations. The two must go together  to reflect the interdependent nature of our world. Multilateral diplomacy is one way  if not the best way  to achieve this goal. It is not superfluous to reiterate that the United Nations serves that purpose best not because it fulfils the role of the world's parliament but because it achieves results in the sole and supreme interests of peace and security. We hope that the forty-fifth session will be notable for its achievements and will continue to serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for the primary purpose of advancing peace and harmony among nations."
"58",2728,"GNB",45,1990,"﻿It is my pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your personal qualities have brought you to this lofty office and augur well for the success of our work.I should like to welcome the delegation of Liechtenstein on that country's admission to membership of the United Nations. My distinguished colleagues and brothers  Heads of States members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS)  have done me the honour of entrusting me with the task of addressing the Assembly in order to mention the situation in the Sahel.The peoples of the Sahel  through me  therefore  wish to express their pleasure in participating in this forum  and welcome the clarity with which the gravity of their specific problems has been perceived.The nine States members with a population of 40 million human beings are pooling their efforts  and have been doing so for ""most two decades  against the consequences of drought and desertification. But in the face of this challenge  they have never been alone. We must stress the unswerving solidarity which the Sahelian countries have enjoyed from the Members of this universal Organisation.The tragedy which has afflicted the peoples of the Sahel underlies the establishment by the United Nations of the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office (UHSO)  a body that tackles the problems of drought and desertification and its ill effects on the process of the development of these countries  which are confronted by the horrors of poverty  hunger and illiteracy.It is fortunate that we can state that  in order to reduce the negative effects of these natural disasters that have afflicted the Sudano-Sahelian countries  the United Nations has recognised the importance of food security in the struggle against drought. The establishment of CIŁSS in 1973 and its adoption of a campaign against desertification reflect the importance which these States attach to this problem.In this context  I must also mention that it is necessary to support the efforts of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which  by establishing the Sahel Club  has created an important instrument in the co-ordination of the efforts of the Members of this Organisation. The first generation programme  produced by CILSS  made it possible to mobilise considerable financial resources from 1976 to 1982 in order to accelerate the development of the region.In spite of these measures  which are considerable  we have to note that they have been inadequate because of the innumerable difficulties confronting the Sahel. Many challenges remain to be confronted in this region the economic situation  the preservation of the environment  health and education The effects of drought together with the world economic crisis constitute serious obstacles which our countries have to overcome in the difficult struggle for development and the ultimate materialisation of the objective of improving the living conditions of the peoples.The effects of development of the CILSS countries have been seriously jeopardised by the ill effects of the world economic system  characterised by the decline in the term of trade  the drop in commodity prices  the drop in aid for development and the weight of external debt.Given the gravity of these problems  serious problems confronting the countries of the Sahel  I am glad to stress  on behalf of my distinguished colleagues wad brothers  who are Heads of States members of CILSS  that our Governments are seeking appropriate ways and means of effectively combating these scourges so as to improve the living conditions of our peoples.We are convinced that we can count on the international community  which has given us its support over the last few years. We welcome the convening of an international Conference on Environment and Development  which has aroused considerable hope among our peoples.I would like to take the opportunity to express the gratitude of the peoples of the Sahel and of our respective governments for the aid and solidarity which have been proffered. I am convinced that the response of the international community and the United Nations system will always live up to the nature and diversity of the problems to be faced.Profound political changes are causing upheaval throughout the world. They are marked by the end of the cold war and the establishment of constructive dialogue among nations. However  the process of detente and the strengthening of world peace in a complex and long one  and should be viewed as a permanent task for all our countries.The Republic of Guinea-Bissau  committed to the principles of the United Nations  wishes to repeat its condemnation of the violation and annexation of any country by another State Member of our Organisation. The threat or the use of force in international relations is unacceptable.Accordingly  my government wishes to express its deep concern at the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq which constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security. Aware as we are of the perils inherent in the situation in the Gulf and its unforeseeable consequences  Guinea-Bissau exhorts Iraq to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Efforts must be continued and all the Machinery capable of bringing about a peaceful solution to the conflict must be brought to bear.The question of the Middle East has now assumed a new dimension tension in the light of new developments in the region. In this regard  we continue to support the idea of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all the parties concerned.The independence of Namibia  which we would like to welcome once again  has breathed new life into the process off the peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the problem of southern Africa  and has opened up encouraging prospect of peace in Angola and Mozambique.We welcome the changes which have occurred in South Africa and the process of dialogue which is under way. However  it is urgent to put an end to confrontation and violence so as to permit the establishment of a climate propitious for the continuation of the negotiating process  which should lead to the establishment of a non-racial and democratic system that would promote fraternal relations and relation of good understanding among all South Africans.Bloody clashes in Liberia are another source of profound concern. We would appeal to the parties to the conflict to put an end to this fratricidal war which is tearing the country apart  causing the loss of innocent lives and destroying material property necessary for the development of the country.The persistence of the occupation of East Timor the inter-community confrontation in Lebanon  differences in the solution of the Cambodian problem and tensions in different parts of the world  in particular in the Korean peninsula and in Cyprus  are also grounds for concern.I should like to stress once again the effective action of the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar for the United Nations and  in particular in the search for a peaceful solution for Western Sahara  and also his personal contribution to the strengthening of the role and prestige of the Organisation. The positive trends in the world today must be seized in order to guarantee a constant climate of dialogue among nations. We must  therefore  individually and collectively respect the principles of the Charter and international norms governing relations among States which have established the primacy of law over force and advocate negotiated solutions for all conflicts. "
"59",2767,"GNQ",45,1990,"﻿As the doors of the General Assembly open on the forty-fifth session  the international community is experiencing a time of great concern and tension as it finds itself on the brink of a confrontation which  if it became a war  would have incalculably harmful effects  a situation which is in contrast with the new spirit of understanding and harmony in which the present session of the General Assembly has opened.It is in this contest that  with a sincere spirit and will  the delegation of Equatorial Guinea appears before the Assembly in order to join in the efforts already made to confirm and support the ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter that were enshrined 45 years ago. We regard these ideals and principles as the appropriate way to strengthen international peace  security and stability. Like previous speakers  I wish sincerely to congratulate the President and say bow pleased we are at his wise  unanimous election to conduct the proceedings of the forty-fifth session. His skill and dedication combined with the ideals and principles of non-alignment that characterise the country he represents  Malta  ensure the best possible treatment of the important end delicate items on our agenda as well as the success of our work.We also congratulate the members of the General Committee. We know their experience  skill  and spirit of sacrifice will lead us to decisions and resolutions that not only reaffirm the authority of the provisions of the Charter  but also strengthen the machinery of the entire United Nations system to meet our present needs.To Ambassador Garba of Nigeria and the other members of the General Committee of the forty-fourth session and subsequent special sessions  we extend sincere congratulations for the competence  seriousness and dedication they demonstrated during their term of office.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  we express profound gratitude for the high sense of responsibility which characterises him as he meets his commitment to enforce the ideals  principles and authority of the United Nations. For the first time in the history of this Organisation  we have had the honour of a visit by the Secretary-General to Equatorial Guinea. This step opens the way to a dialogue which could lead to combined  multilateral efforts for the socio-economic  political and cultural development of Equatorial Guinea. For this gesture  which will be indelible in the minds of the population of Equatorial Guinea  on ¡behalf of His Excellency Obiang-Mguema Mbasogo  President of our Republic  we extend our deepest thanks to the Secretary-General.  The recent admission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the international community in also a source of satisfaction because it is the realisation of an ideal expressed 45 years ago.We also have among us a reunified Yemen  and a reunified Germany. This increases our hope and conviction that we are on the way towards a genuine United Nations m we distance ourselves from those outdated behaviours enshrined in treaties and conventions that disregarded the dignity and rights of the person and of the family.In this contest  and in this direction  Equatorial Guinea is pleased at the beginning of a high-level dialogue  the first in approximately 40 years  between North and South Korea with a view to the country's reunification. We hope that in the framework of this necessary and important dialogue  whose common denominator is unification - the expression of the Korean nation - all aspects will be raised and decided through agreement and without foreign intervention until we have the opportunity to see the Korean people wall represented here in the world Organisation.Equatorial Guinea is pleased to see the end of the cold war  characterised by the rapprochement between the two super-Powers and the sequel of changes in the course of history  which opens up new horizons of peace  understanding and co-operation on the basis of the principles of freedom and independence.While we commend the achievements just mentioned - the emergence of the winds of democratic change in Eastern Europe and in Central America  and other changes that have an effect on the complete application of the principle of self-determination and independence of peoples - some clarifications are necessary.In South Africa  the release of Nelson Mandela has not meant the dismantling of the system of apartheid.The much-desired and urgent solution to the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the recovery of the State of Kuwait must not overshadow the urgent need to find a fair solution to the Palestinian problem. Equatorial Guinea  while it supports and reaffirms the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally-recognised borders  regrets having to note that the territories of certain Arab countries  which have the same right to a free and independent existence  remain occupied by Israel  and that the people of Palestine remain homeless. We continue to believe that as long as occupation by force of arms persist in that part of the world it will be difficult to see peace on the horizon for the populations of that region so long afflicted by the horrors of war.In open and flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  of international law and of International conventions whose provisions have been implemented by the international community for decades  two months ago  Kuwait - a sovereign and independent State  a Member of the United Nations - was invaded and occupied by Iraq  another independent  sovereign State and a Member of this Organisation  which  not content with being in flagrant violation of international law and the norms of international coexistence  has gone even further by stripping the Kuwaitis of their nationality on their own territory. Equatorial Guinea rejects this invasion  which was crowned by occupation  and completely supports the Security Council resolutions on the crisis in the Persian Gulf. At the same time we make a firm appeal to Iraq to leave Kuwait unconditionally. In this way  it will respond with gratitude to the United Nations  which in the past expressed support for it when it was occupied by another foreign force. Equatorial Guinea supports and welcome the positive steps which have been taken in South Africa – the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and the start of direct negotiations between the South African authorities and the leaders of the African Congress. We recognize the importance of these actions and the courage of the South African President in his choice of a direction contrary to that usually followed by the apartheid regime.  We therefore hope that the United Nations will follow closely the developments in that country with a view to achieving our common objective of a South Africa free from the system of apartheid and headed by a democratically elected Government.From this rostrum I appeal to the people and leaders of Liberia to reassess their attitudes and put an end to the fratricidal war which so far has achieved nothing but the unnecessary loss of innocent lives and considerable material damage. This situation is unacceptable  particularly at this critical stage of general economic deterioration  and given the widespread natural and man-made phenomena which pose serious danger for mankind - disease  hunger and illiteracy. In the hope that Liberians can subordinate selfish tribal and other interests to higher national patriotic interests  we praise the efforts made to far by other countries of the subregion with a view to restoring peace in Liberia.With the same objectives and the same fervour we call upon the governments of Chad and of Libya to place the higher interests of their subregion and of Africa above national claims and to accept an international solution to the territorial claims the two countries have prosecuted for several decades.We welcome the positive steps made with the co-operation of the international community in general and the Secretary-General  in particular towards peaceful settlements of the problem of Cambodia and of Afghanistan. We hope final solutions to those problem will reaffirm the sacred principles of the Charter the restoration of peace  respect for the sovereignty and independence of the countries in question  the right and the freedom of their nationals to return voluntarily to their countries of origin  and the formation of governments and the choice of social  economic and political system of their choosing on a democratic basis.Although situated on the opposite shore of the Atlantic  Equatorial Guinea is closely following developments in Latin America  because of a long historical tradition. We welcome the responsibility and realise that are guiding Central American leaders  who now see that sincere and direct dialogue is more powerful than the roar of cannon and machine-guns  and that understanding and co-operation are the most effective way of solving problem and socio-economic disputes.In contrast to that encouraging picture  we regret to note the persistence of certain hotbeds of tension  where violence continues to be the order of the day. We are convinced that the tireless efforts by leaders in the southern hemisphere of the Americas will lead to peaceful and equitable solutions to the problem behind  those hotbeds of violence and of disregard of human rights. Bilateral and subregional treaties and declarations and the restoration and preservation of the identity of Latin American peoples will make a positive contribution to the attainment of these objectives.Now more than ever  the international community aspires to peace and development  both of which simultaneously constitute cause and effect. But peace and development  while hard to define  can be attained in many and various ways. The urgent need for general and complete disarmament and for an end to the arms race is generally endorsed by the international community. These are the corner-stone of peace and development.Many inhuman practices have been ended over the centuries as human history has developed. But unfortunately the ancient art of war is still very much on the mind of present generations  which gives rise to the fear and distrust that have motivated the establishment of ideological and military blocs and which impedes the necessary co-operation and improved interdependent relations among peoples and nations.Now that the cold war has ended  Equatorial Guinea hopes also for an end to the fear and distrust still so evident in the negotiations on the establishment of a new international economic order.We hope too that  as a hallmark of the new era  the developing countries in general and the least developed among them in particular will have the full support of the international community in reducing the heavy burden of foreign debt and the undervaluing of their commodities  in accordance with the Paris Declaration  the Programme of Action for the 1990s for the benefit of the least developed countries and other bilateral and multilateral instruments adopted previously. Equatorial Guinea is concerned at the deterioration of the environment  because we feel this is a grave threat to human survival. We therefore supported the consensus on the convening in 1992 in Brazil of the World Conference on Environment and Development  and have recently established a national commission to examine natural phenomena in this sphere and their impact on human  animal and plant life.For the first time in the history of the United Nations  leaders from all continents assembled to discuss a subject of enormous importance  a timeless subject decisive for the future of the human race. I am referring to the recent World Summit for Children. That important and unique event  which gave rise to the formulation and planning of important activities and efforts for the survival  protection and development of the child  was nothing less than a recognition of our own reality  and the payment of a debt to generations past. It committed us to bequeath the results of our work to a future generation that will be able to overcome our difficulties and shortcomings. Equatorial Guinea will soon make a modest contribution to consolidating the instruments adopted for the benefit of the child.I cannot fail on this occasion to express my profound and sincere thanks to each and every friendly country which  directly or indirectly  has assisted and continues to assist Equatorial Guinea in its complex endeavours to achieve a better Equatorial Guinea. We are equally grateful to the entire United Nations system  particularly the United Nations Development Programmes  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  the World Health Organization  the United Nations Fund for Population Activities  the United Nations Children's Fund  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the International Labour Organisation  the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and others  for their assistance and their direct contributions to a wide range of development projects with a direct or indirect impact on improving the life of our people.She Republic of Equatorial Guinea sincerely welcomes the results of developments in various parts of the world  which have been propelled by the winds of democracy  and which have resulted in the establishment as a preliminary step of unity  peace and justice as national objectives incorporated in our basic law and set as priorities in the political programme adopted by our people. We are aware of the danger of repeating the same errors  of forgetting the past; any institution or society that is resistant to change - which cannot fail to cause phenomena  in time and in space  that run counter to the will of the people - is doomed to disappear as soon as it appears on the scene.During the period before its independence  Equatorial Guinea experienced the climate of a multi-party system; for obvious reasons  and although it democratically represented the body of opinion  this unfortunately ended in a struggle for political power and a quest for supremacy based on tribal and ethnic criteria  a few years later  having gained national sovereignty. Equatorial Guinea knew the horrors of a single party system whose be-all and end-all was the sanctification of a cult of personality. Given that sad experience  we sow perceive the benefits of a return to a multiparty system as the authentic expression and manifestation of democracy. The fact that Equatorial Guinea still has only one political party is not a contradiction and should not be viewed as unwillingness to allow the popular will to express itself. Rather  it represents a preliminary educational and formative phase for the population to ensure that we do not repeat sorry past experience and that we mature in the process and interplay of democracy. In Equatorial Guinea for the time being there may be only one political party  but it is not a single party.Thus do we perceive and thus are we implementing human rights and fundamental freedoms  which are legally guaranteed in our basic charter. The recent release of many detainees and the total or partial pardons granted to others on 3 August this year are only two out of many examples of the efforts that are being made to restore the dignity of the human being and achieve respect for human rights and freedoms.In this connection we regret that the analysis and judgement made with regard to the violation of human rights in certain countries does not make use of legal  equitable and universal criteria. In our opinion the lack of functioning democratic institutions and freedom of the press  information and opinion  although such things are fundamental  is not sufficient grounds to determine that those rights are being violated in a given country unless one can also demonstrate that the country is financially able to maintain such infrastructures.The people of Equatorial Guinea  aware of their past and their present and of the direction they must take to future prosperity  cannot realise their political goals and full development in isolation from the outside world. In carrying out their political programme they therefore attach a special importance to the implementation of a policy of good-neighbourliness and to the establishment of good relations with all countries based on principles of equality and mutual respect. We attach great merit to the policy of international co-operation  provided that such co-operation does not restrict our inalienable rights of freedom and sovereignty. This is evidenced by our continued membership in various bodies and our continued ratification of various international conventions.In conclusion I should like to state that the United Nations was founded in response to the imbalances and imperfections within the societies that existed 45 years ago. Hence the existence of the United Nations  and the lasting confidence placed in it  continues to be functions of the persistence of imbalances and imperfections in certain societies at the present time."
"60",2813,"GRC",45,1990,"﻿At the outset I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. We are indeed deeply satisfied because the representative of a country with which Greece maintains close relations of friendship is presiding over the General Assembly  and also because you are well known for your great diplomatic skills and experience  qualities that will undoubtedly be conducive to the success of this forty-fifth session.My sincere thanks go  too  to the outgoing President  Major-General Garba  for the excellent way he carried out his task in guiding the proceedings of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.I would be remiss if I did not express my deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for the untiring efforts in setting the pace of the main United Nations task: maintaining world peace and security. Earlier this week  the Foreign Minister of Italy  in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Communities  delivered a statement on behalf of its twelve member States. My Government fully subscribes to the views expressed by Mr. De Michelis. However  I would like to stress certain specific points of particular interest to Greece.For Europe  the period under review has been one of the most significant since the end of the Second World War. During the year that elapsed  the foundations for a better future in Europe were laid  while the unification of Germany  an event of great historic importance  is to be realized in the coming days. Europe is being ushered well into the twenty-first century. Human rights  the rule of law and democracy have been established in most of Eastern Europe. Human dignity and freedom of expression have been placed at the epicentre of politics as never before in the history of our continent. In normal circumstances  such political changes - which virtually amount to what could perhaps be called a revolution of the individual - would have taken several decades to come about.It is a time for rejoicing  but also for reckoning because  first  these changes must be consolidated; secondly  these changes towards respect for human rights and democracy should embrace the whole continent.With regard to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  in particular  many ideas have emerged. Several of them are oven pace-setting  but all need very careful consideration as to their applicability within the European framework. The more States respect human rights on their very own initiative  the less new bureaucratic mechanisms are needed. In the CSCE  one important achievement in human rights  which reflects Europe1s ""new thinking""  is the Copenhagen Document of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE  which indeed sets forth new standards of excellence in the field of human rights. As regards the second basket of the Helsinki Final Act  mention should be made of the Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe. Delegations agreed on the need to establish market-oriented economies throughout Europe  and recognised the link between private enterprise and pluralistic democracy. Greece considers this Conference as an important step towards creating a climate of mutual trust  peace and security in our continent.Furthermore  we are strongly in favour of convening a conference on security and co-operation in the Mediterranean  following the example of the CSCE.Greece  a European country within the Mediterranean  has a strong interest in the convening of such a conference. It attaches particular importance to the strengthening of ties between the countries of the region  the easing of tensions and the eventual settlement of problems in that sensitive area. This can be achieved only by the participation in the conference and its preparatory meetings of all Mediterranean countries  as well as those States that have a prevailing interest in the region. Such a global approach is of paramount importance for a successful conference on security and co-operation in the Mediterranean. A case-by-case approach would only obfuscate the problems of the Mediterranean region.A similar process  in regional terms  was initiated among the countries of the Balkan peninsula. In this connection  may I recall that  since the mid-1970s  Greece has undertaken a series of important initiatives aimed at the consolidation of peace co-operation in the Balkans  on the basis of the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.Following the meeting of the six Balkan foreign ministers in Belgrade two years ago  several specialized meetings were organized  which resulted in enlarging the areas of common interest. During 1990  two successful high-level meetings took place in Athens and in Bucharest  while the second meeting of ministers for foreign affairs is scheduled to take place in Tirana next month. We hope that this meeting will constitute an important step in strengthening multilateral and bilateral co-operation in the Balkan peninsula.With regard to neighbouring Turkey  Greece is determined to conduct a serious and sincere dialogue  founded on respect for the Treaty of Lausanne and international law. This dialogue should aim at overcoming the differences affecting our bilateral relations and at establishing lasting links of friendly co-operation. However  one should bear in mind that the question of Cyprus affects the relations between Greece and Turkey in the most direct way. Therefore  it would not be realistic to expect the dialogue to proceed in a successful way as long as a solution to the problem of Cyprus is not found  based on the principles of the relevant United Nations resolutions and of the high-level agreements of 1977 and 1979.I believe none of us in this Hall doubts that respect for the United Nations resolutions is the absolute prerequisite in the quest for a just and viable solution to regional problems. One of these is the problem o£ Cyprus which  however  stands out as a most blatant example of disregard of the relevant United Nations resolutions. As a result  the dividing-lines imposed by force in the island republic 16 years ago still exist at a time when the walls that separate people have crumbled throughout the European continent. Just three days ago  in toasting the heads of State and government attending this Assembly  the Secretary-General of the United Nations stressed that the Security Council had  regarding Kuwait: ""given emphatic expression to the principle that invasion of one State by another is not to be permitted or countenanced  and that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible"". What is valid for Kuwait is equally valid for Cyprus.There is no need to repeat the veil-known facts about the consequences of the invasion of Cyprus. The 200 000 refugees  the missing persons  the plight of the Greek Cypriots who are hemmed in  the continuing colonisation of the occupied territories and the looting and destruction of the cultural heritage in the occupied part of the island are facts known to all.Since the last session of the General Assembly  the Secretary-General continued to strive for a solution of the Cyprus problem within the framework of his mission of good offices  but to no avail  owing to the intransigence of Mr. Denktash. Thus  the latest attempt to breathe new life into the inter-communal talks ended in total collapse.The case was set out clearly in the Secretary-General's report of 8 March 1990. In this document (S 21183)  it is stated that Mr. Denktash's insistence that the term ""communities"" be used in a manner that is synonymous with the term ""peoples""  each having a separate right to ""self-determination""  created an impasse of a substantive kind  which raised questions regarding the essence of the Secretary-General's mandate of good offices. The Security Council  to which the Secretary-General turned for guidance  rejected this attempt to change the basis of the talks. The impasse  however  has persisted  owing again to Mr. Denktash's unwillingness to renounce his intransigent views. In fact  it has even deepened further  as a result of various provocative actions taken by the Turkish authorities.Thus  last July  the Turkish forces of occupation handed over the control of Varosha  the new town of Famagusta   to the so-called Turkish-Cypriot security forces  a development which could lead to an eventual settlement of the area by people other than its inhabitants. In view of this  the President of the Security Council again felt compelled  in his statement of 19 July to voice the concern of the members of the Council over any action which contravenes paragraph 5 of resolution SSO (1984). This paragraph states clearly that the Security Council ""considers attempts to settle any part of Varosha by people ether than its inhabitants as inadmissible and calls for the transfer of the area to the  administration of the United Nations. In spite of the general outcry provoked by this section  Turkey went on to sign a pseudo-agreement with a pseudo-State providing for an abolition of passport requirements and for a customs union between Turkey and those parts of the Republic of Cyprus still occupied by Turkish military forces. Apart from the obvious disregard of the will of the international community demonstrated by this move  this so-called agreement clearly contravenes the provisions of the Association Agreement between the European Community and Cyprus as well as the ones between the European Community and Turkey.Greece for its part  will continue to give its full support  in close co-operation with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus  to the Secretary-General's mission of good offices. In the belief that the continuing military occupation of a part of the territory o£ a sovereign State Member of this Organisation constitutes a permanent threat to peace and security in that sensitive area of the eastern Mediterranean  my country calls for the implementation  without any further delay  of all United Nations resolutions relating to Cyprus  which clearly also provide for the withdrawal of all Turkish troops. Greece appeals to all States Members of the United Nations to show the same sensitivity towards Cyprus as the one demonstrated towards Kuwait. In fact  action taken recently by the United Nations in the Gulf crisis does not exhaust the ability of the Organisation to resolve crises arising from invasion and military occupation of a third country. The -Cyprus problem remains still open and calls for its urgent settlement. Otherwise we have to ask ourselves: for how long can we accept attempts to relegate to oblivion the shame of the invasion? For how long can we preach social goodness and practise political obfuscation? For how long can t-e substitute inertia for action?During past years  efforts leading to nuclear  conventional and chemical disarmament have attained unprecedented progress. Following the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles  we are now looking forward to further progress on the conclusion of agreements on strategic nuclear armaments and chemical weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union. Greece attaches the utmost importance to both these goals.Greece  as one of the first parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  has been firmly attached to the provisions of the Treaty and supported the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We reiterate the appeal to States which are not yet parties to it to adhere rapidly to that Treaty  since adherence to it by all States will constitute an additional guarantee for international peace and security.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe context remains indeed the most efficient negotiating framework for conventional disarmament. We earnestly hope that the next summit meeting of that Conference in Paris will take note of the signing of the agreement on conventional armed forces in Europe and of the results achieved in the negotiations on confidence and security-building measures. Thus the way will be paved for new conventional arms control negotiations with a view to the strengthening of security and stability in Europe by eliminating the capacity for surprise attack and large-scale offensive action and establishing a stable and secure balance of conventional armed forces  including conventional armaments  at lower levels. If this goal is achieved  the risks of political and military confrontation on our continent will be significantly reduced.Last year  from this very podium  we added our voice to those who expressed optimism for the rapprochement between East and Hest. Yet our hopes that all disputes between States could be settled by peaceful means as provided for in the United Nations Charter have not come true. New setbacks occurred  and the world situation is far from satisfactory. The recent tragic events in the Gulf region have dashed our high expectations and are jeopardising our common efforts towards creating a new climate for international relations. Such acts  which contravene the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter and international legality as well as international morality  cannot but be categorically condemned.Greece  along with its European Community partners  expressed from the very outset its unreserved condemnation of the invasion and called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from the territory of Kuwait. My country  firmly committed to the ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter  has rejected outright the annexation of Kuwait. My Government fully endorses all the measures taken for the restoration of legality in Kuwait and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Let me once again underline that  if previous resolutions of the Security Council had been enforced  especially in cases of invasion  we might not have witnessed the present tragic situation in the Gulf area. Such an enforcement might have acted as a deterrent for any would-be aggressor.It is in this spirit that my Government has spared no effort in providing its own contribution for the solution of the crisis  for the release of foreign citizens illegally held by the Iraqi authorities  among which also are many Greek citizens  and eventually for the re-establishment of peace and security in the area.More particularly  Greece has decided to accept the request made by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and thus participate in the multinational force  through the Frigate Lemnos. This decision was motivated by our country's attachment to freedom  to peace and to respect for the principles of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all nations. This is all the more pertinent in the case of small  weak nations  for which international solidarity and collective defence are of the utmost importance. Referring now to the Palestinian problem  the peace process remains in a stalemate. Our long-standing position is that a just  comprehensive and permanent solution to it can be achieved by the convening of an international peace conference with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the parties directly involved  including  of course  the Palestinian people  represented by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. However  the peace process is currently blocked  owing to the persistence of Israel in creating new faits accomplis  namely  by creating settlements in territories occupied since 1967.Linked by traditional ties of friendship and co-operation with the countries and peoples of the area  Greece attaches particular importance to the resolution of this problem. The recent upgrading of our diplomatic relations with Israel  while not entailing a change in our Middle East policy  offers us greater possibilities of participating in efforts to resolve this long-standing problem.In Lebanon  the Taif agreement  the objective of which was to restore Lebanese institutions shaken by war  gave rise to hopes for a peaceful settlement. In this regard  the election of a new President  as well as the formation of a Government  have been the first encouraging steps for the implementation of this national reconciliation agreement. We earnestly hope that the process will continue.My Government welcomes the strengthening of democracy in Latin America  with the countries of which we share many cultural and historical ties  and the significant steps along the path of reconciliation in the area. At the same time  we feel concern over the acute socio-economic problems the region faces. We believe that the process of regional integration could open new prospects for the Latin American countries in the course of this decade. The situation in Southern Africa has always been followed with special attention by my country. Events have taken place over the past 12 months that give us strong feelings of hope that a new climate of peace and progress will soon prevail in that region.First of all  the people of Namibia have achieved their well-deserved independence and their country has become a full member of the international community. This is a major development  which marks the beginning of a new era in southern Africa.The recent developments in South Africa have also increased the prospects for the elimination of the abhorrent system of apartheid and its replacement by a new  united  non-racial and democratic South African society. We have welcomed the positive steps taken by President de Klerk since his election in September 1989  in particular the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the removal of the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other political organizations  the lifting of the state of emergency - except for Natal Province - and the partial repeal of the apartheid legislation. Furthermore  the outcome of the Pretoria meetings in August has amply demonstrated a statesmanlike determination by the two sides to remove the remaining obstacles to engaging in substantial negotiations for a new constitutional order in South Africa. The decision of the African National Congress to suspend the armed struggle deserves our special praise.Let me now turn to the sphere of international economics. To cope with the world of transition  where  more than ever before  economic problems occupy a central place on the world political agenda  a greater degree of collaboration in international affairs and a wider vision are necessary.The integration of the world economy has made imperative the shaping of new policies to respond to the increasing degree of interdependence of national economies. Such saw policies should take into serious consideration the ongoing changes in Central and Eastern Europe so that the decisions to be made on economic issues could satisfy the demands and help solve the problems of the countries in the region.The recent adoption by consensus of a universal declaration on international economic co-operation - with the active participation of Greece - has set in motion a process of change challenging the past models and ideas about development  which were oversimplified  and introducing more pragmatic approaches to economic and social issues.Moreover  international economic co-operation is considered essential for the elimination of trade obstacles  for increased market efficiency  for the encouragement of respective national economic possibilities  and for the prevention of distortions in trade flow as well as in transfers of technology and financial resources. International economic co-operation should also take account of the inequalities witnessed in the economic development of the various countries  their respective national policies and the international economic environment.The problems of many heavily indebted countries are a cause of; grave concern and can become  in the long term  a threat to political stability. The debt problem is complex. An equitable and mutually agreed solution can be reached only by an approach based on development  within the framework of an integrated  growth-oriented strategy that takes account of the particular circumstances of each country.In view of past experience with debt and development problems  a successful debt strategy should be directed towards achieving the following combined measures: voluntary debt reduction by commercial banks  serious adjustment efforts by debtor countries  and changes in the tax and regulatory regimes of industrial countries. Nevertheless  real progress can be achieved only if Governments are prepared to support economic stabilisation by taking the appropriate measures to adjust their own economies to prevailing market conditions.Another serious problem  of international concern  is that of poverty. To cope with this problem courageous measures are needed at both the national and the international levels. At the national level  a solution cannot be achieved merely by increasing social expenditure. What is needed is an increase in real gross national product. To that end an appropriate institutional framework should be created in order to attract foreign capital and promote private investment. At the international level  an increase in bilateral and multilateral aid to prevent famine and human suffering is a social must for our world.In the past few years the problem of the environment has come to the fore; at present it constitutes a major international concern. Our community ought to develop an effective environmental policy which would not place obstacles in the path of the establishment of the appropriate industrial infrastructure while at the same time achieving the overall development goals of each country. Greece attaches the utmost importance to the 1992 United Nations Conference  which  we believe  will adopt an environmental strategy based on that particular concept of sustainable development while at the same time ensuring the transfer of a technology compatible with the environmental protection targets set by national economic policies.The dramatic increase in drug abuse and in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotics constitutes the most serious social issue confronting the international community. The problem facing us today is not confined to the framework of drugs or money laundering. Rather  it is linked with violence and  in particular  with terrorism and the illegal arms trade. Greece is actively engaged in the fight against drugs and is currently considering the adoption of new legislation and policies to tackle the problem successfully. The development of economic and trade relations between the European countries and the Middle East has resulted in an increased importance of the Balkan route for drug trafficking. In order to deal with the related problems even more effectively Greece is co-operating  in the European Communities  the Balkans and Central Europe  with the countries concerned with a view to reaching agreement on practical measures.National measures alone cannot contain this threat. Only concerted international action can deal effectively with the drug problem in all its aspects. In this respect we commend the work of the United Nations and  in particular  the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control  which provides valuable assistance to countries that seed it most. We welcome also the adoption at the seventeenth special session of the General Assembly  on drugs  of the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action  which  we hope  will be implemented by all Member States  thus establishing the necessary framework for the struggle against drugs.Following the East-Heat rapprochement and the favourable conditions in international relations that have emerged there from  we believe the moment has come to reinforce and consolidate some institutions of international law  especially those referring to the peaceful settlement of disputes and the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.My Government has always attached great importance to the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes and has always contributed positively to all efforts aimed at strengthening that obligation. It did so particularly when the Manila Declaration on Peaceful Settlement of Disputes was being drawn up. Now we hope that the coming of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCB) on this particular question  to be held in Valetta in early 1991 under promising condition  will give new impetus to all efforts undertaken in this regard.We also attach great importance to the enhancement of the role of the International Court of Justice so that it can develop into a central factor for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.As far as the Decade of International Law is concerned  my Government is strongly in favour of the relevant process and firmly believes that no efforts should be spared to this end. The idea which must be at the heart of all our efforts is the primacy of international law. It is indeed unacceptable for the international community to put up with the flagrant violation of jus cogens principles enshrined in the Charter and to watch resolutions of the supreme organ of the United Nations being deliberately discarded and set aside. In concluding  I wish to underline once again the pre-eminent role which we feel the United Nations is called to play at the present juncture in international affairs. My Government considers that our Organisation has a crucial mission to accomplish  one which relates  not only to the maintenance of world peace and security  but also to the eradication of poverty and the protection of human dignity.In the view of my Government  the present crisis in international relations can be overcome only if we intensify our co-operation and direct our efforts towards implementing and reactivating all the provisions of the Charter  in particular those which have remained a dead letter so far. We believe that fruitful results will be reached thereby and that the authority and prestige of the United Nations will be thus enhanced  especially in the eyes of the younger generations of this world.In the very next days  the World Summit for Children will be held in this building  in this very Hall. Let us avail ourselves of this opportunity to consider our responsibilities towards these young generations and pledge our best efforts to help create a better world for them  a world free of poverty  free of hatred  free of strife."
"61",2854,"GRD",45,1990,"﻿My Government views this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly as one which is of particular importance to the international community  especially as it has been convened at a time when the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations need to be reaffirmed  upheld and defended by Member States. This session is also taking place amidst increasing concerns on the part of small States over specific events and policies which are not conducive to the progressive development of our countries. During the latter part of 1989 and early 1990 the international community had great expectations of a peaceful decade ahead. We were optimistic that we should be able to begin seriously to address the difficult issues of underdevelopment and economic inequities  thus creating the basis for a durable peace  respect for the rights of the individual  justice and democracy. Recent events  however  constitute a set-back to peace and progress as we await the fuller articulation of the Middle East crisis.It is in this uncertain and challenging environment that ray delegation wishes to extend congratulations to you  SIR  on your election as President of the General Assembly at this forty-fifth session and to express our confidence that you will guide the work of this session to positive results. My delegation wishes to express its profound thanks and highest commendations to Mr. Garba for his exemplary conduct of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is also pleased to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts for peace throughout the world.I bring to the forty-fifth session warm greetings from the newly elected Government of Grenada. The elections were the second since the sad events which befell our country during October 1983. Today the people of Grenada are able to exorcise their democratic rights in a free society. My Government has instituted mechanisms for affective consultation with our people on key issues of national concern. At present  we are actively preparing for the   re—introduction of local government to enable our citizens to participate in the management of their own affairs. These political institutions  rooted in respect for the rights of the individual and the rule of law  are seriously guarded by our Government and people. On the economic front  my Government has carefully prioritised its major macro-economic goals so as to create the conditions for sustained growth and balanced development? Sadly  however  public finances continue to be hard-pressed and  in April of this year  suffered a serious blow with the unfortunate occurrence of a massive fire which destroyed our nation's financial complex. The damage amounted to several million dollars and has further set back our recovery. It has also weakened our ability to properly service our debts and our membership contributions to certain international organisations.However  I wish to give the assurance that my Government is committed to observing the principles enshrined in the Charter and is prepared to conduct its international relations on the basis of this commitment and in accordance with the stated norms and standards of international law.Happily  this session is not required to address the question of the independence of Namibia. The people of Namibia have at last chosen their leaders. Grenada notes with satisfaction the crucial role played by the United Nations in helping to bring about independence for Namibia. My delegation wishes to especially welcome Namibia as a full Member of the United Nations and to extend warmest greetings to its delegation.I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Liechtenstein to the family of nations and to convey our best wishes to its delegation.It cannot be denied that the peculiar circumstances of small States tend  unfortunately  to produce opportunities for the execution of unlawful schemes by radical groups  and for acts of aggression by States  in total disregard of the inalienable rights of peoples to determine their own destinies in freedom and by peaceful means. Quite recently  the Caribbean region was again assaulted by an attempt to overthrow the constitutionally elected Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago - an act which was strongly condemned by my Government.The failure of this attempt strengthens and reinforces the democratic process of choosing leadership by constitutional means. But this development does not only serve to underscore the patent vulnerability of small States and to demonstrate that threats to peace and security can emerge from any quarter  but also provides opportunities for developed States to show greater sensitivity to the conditions affecting small States. Furthermore  such incidents highlight the relevance of mechanisms of collective action as envisaged by the Charter of the United Nations  especially as it relates to the legitimate security concerns and political survival of these States.The Government of Grenada is anxious to receive concrete assurances that less-developed disadvantaged States  in general  and small island developing countries  in particular  will not be the net losers in current attempts aimed at buttressing political change in Eastern Europe by directing massive financial and economic assistance to those countries.While we welcome political changes in Eastern Europe  my Government will continue to appeal for higher and more diversified levels of assistance for countries such as ours and for a significant relaxation of disabling conditionalities regularly imposed by international financial institutions. Such developments  we contend  will help to avoid economic  social and political instability with their attendant consequences.The amelioration of conditions of poverty and the gradual development of our societies will not be realised if  in the process  we experience environmental dis-benefits  a real threat to human life exists today  expressed in terms of the phenomenon of global warming  pollution  the destruction of vital ecosystems and the dumping of toxic waste and other hazardous substances. These negative side effects of technological advancement and industrial development can deal significant blows particularly to smaller countries whose fragile economies can hardly provide resources for the effective management  control and combating of those conditions. My Government fully supports the development of mechanisms designed to address the problems associated with environmental hazards and calls for the commitment of adequate financial and other resources for this purpose. Accordingly  Grenada looks forward to the United Nations-sponsored Conference on the Environment and Development scheduled for 1992 in Brazil.Hardly a country among us has been spared the scourge of illegal drugs. The destruction of the social fabric of modern societies has been accompanied by the gradual erosion of the political authority of many States  as the narco-traffickers intensify their death-bearing actions.Success in the fight against drugs in a small island State will depend on the co-ordination of policies  on the regional and international levels  aimed at reducing the production of  the demand for  and traffic in illegal drugs and substances. The resources required for effective action on this front are clearly not available to small States  which are particularly vulnerable as transit-points for the drug trade. Accordingly  within the context of the international anti-drug campaign  my Government anticipates greater levels of international collaboration and co-operation in addressing problems of drug production  trafficking  addiction  interdiction and rehabilitation. The beginning of the decade has brought with it enormous change. In the world political landscape  notably in Eastern Europe and Latin America where Millions of people have been able to freely elect governments of their choice. We have witnessed relaxation of tension and a retreat from cold-war conditions between the super-Powers. Important steps towards nuclear disarmament have also been taken. My Government welcomes these positive developments. However  we are cognisant of the existence of other sources of tension which require urgent attention and settlement.The ink had hardly dried on the Iraq-Iran truce; we had not completed paying a tribute to the valiant work of the illustrious Secretary-General and his special envoys who had mediated that settlement  when a new threat to peace and stability in the Middle East  and the world at large  emerged. Grenada condemns the aggressive actions of the Iraqi regime in invading and annexing the territory of Kuwait  and urges the immediate and peaceful withdrawal of its troops. My government fully supports Security Council resolution· 660 (1990) and 661 (1990)  and calls upon Iraq to adhere to the principles of international relationship· as inscribed in the United Nations Charter. It is my country's fervent hope that this crisis will be settled peacefully.In July 1988  my Party  which now forms the Governing of Grenada  was instrumental in forwarding the signatures of 12 000 Grenadians petitioning for the release of freedom  fighter Nelson Mandela. This petition  of which we are justly proud  added the Grenadian voices to the millions of others around the world calling for justice on his behalf.My Government applauds the release of Nelson Mandela  and notes with interest the minor adjustment to the infrastructure of apartheid. However  to the extent that the goal of majority rule remains unattained in South Africa  Grenada urges the intensification of economic sanctions against the Pretoria regime so as to cause the rapid demise of the apartheid system and to secure respect for human equality  dignity and freedom.My delegation is hopeful that significant progress will be achieved in ongoing talks  concerning Cambodia so that peace can return to the people of that suffering country.We are also extremely anxious for a negotiated settlement of the Korean question in accordance with the preferences of the Korean people and through mechanisms which they believe can facilitate the goal of Korean reunification. The historical circumstances and political considerations which inspired the exclusion of these sovereign States from the United Nations have abated sufficiently to allow the Korean people a voice in this august body  a right which they are fully competent to exercise. Notwithstanding the fact that reunification has thus far proven to be illusive  my government conceives of no justifiable basis for the continued denial of full membership in the United Nations of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  if the latter so wishes.In the Caribbean region  my government fully supports efforts to assist Haiti in developing political and institutional arrangements that would allow the people of that country to choose a Government  un-coerced by the threat or use of force  and lay the basis for sustained democratic practices. My Government takes this opportunity also to reaffirm its commitment to the regional integration process  which is so essential to the survival and development of the Caribbean region  especially in the light of the emergency of new trading and economic blocs in this region of the world.My Government wishes to congratulate the people of Nicaragua on their hold step in favour of peace and democracy. Of course  there are tremendous challenges to be met in the process of reconstruction and consolidation  and our best wishes are extended to the Government and the people of Nicaragua. At the same time  my Government notes with concern the unsettled situation in El Salvador. Granada supports efforts by the United Nations to mediate in peace talks between the Government of El Salvador and the FMLN. Generally  we look forward to the complete success of the peace process in Central America  and applaud those regional leaders  in particular the former President of Costa Rica and Nobel Peace Prise winner  Oscar Arias Sanchez  who have played such a critical role in the movement towards peace  stability and democracy.My Government wishes to commend the initiative of those world leaders whose vision and determination led to the convening of the recently concluded World Summit for Children. May I take this opportunity to inform the General Assembly that Grenada has taken all steps necessary for the immediate ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is our hope that Member States will find it possible to become parties to the Convention at the earliest opportunity. My government is currently engaging the nation in public discussion on draft legislation to protect the rights of children in accordance with the United Nations Convention.Throughout the world  the co-operative movement plays a vital role in the economic and social life of many people  millions of whom participate in credit unions and producer co-operatives  thereby providing valuable resources and opportunities for mutual co-operation and self-help. My Government recognizes the importance of co-operatives and is pleased to give support to the call that 1995 should be declared International Year of Co-operatives.In conclusion  my delegation cannot allow this occasion to go by without commenting on the favourable trends manifested in the rapprochement between Scot and Hest  especially in the developments in Europe  with the historic turning-point that has taken place in the unification of Germany. My delegation extends sincere congratulations to the people of united Germany and to the unity Government that represents them.These developments will provide new opportunities for the creation of a free  democratic and pluralistic Europe based on peaceful co-operation. Furthermore  the increasingly close co-operation between the United States of America and the Soviet Union is seen as a positive development which will significantly strengthen the role of the United States in fulfilling its primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security  and has heightened the possibility of resolving the formidable global challenges facing the world community.My delegation believes that this is the moment when the United Nations can once again play the central role for which it was envisaged at the very beginning. We believe that with the political will and the determination to pursue the noble objectives of the Charter of the Organisation  we might deliberate during this session for the benefit of all countries  and for Mankind.

"62",2901,"GTM",45,1990,"Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Guatemala  I wish to extend to Mr. de Marco most cordial congratulations on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at the forty-fifth session.On behalf of the Government of Guatemala  I wish to say that we are very pleased at the admission to the United Nations of Namibia and Liechtenstein as full-fledged Members  since this reinforces the principle of universality of our Organization. I should also like to place on record the profound appreciation of the people and the Government of Guatemala to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his constant efforts in the search for peace and the strengthening of democracy in Central America and other parts of the world. I cannot fail to state how pleased the Government of Guatemala is at the new climate of dialogue and well-conceived co-operation that has been generated by the attitude of the United States and the Soviet Union and the very important fact for Europe and the world at large of the achievement of a united Germany  which could be a decisive factor for world peace. In the same context  we wish to underscore the importance of the process of democratization in Eastern Europe. We recognize the special relevance of the World Summit for Children  and we are pleased to state that the Government of Guatemala signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child when it was opened to signature and ratified it before its entry into force. The Government of President Cerezo has reiterated its faith in the purpose and principles of the United Nations and its political will to co-operate resolutely in this world forum towards the achievement of the highest values it has enshrined for mankind  such as peace  freedom and justice. He has also reaffirmed his commitment to the defence and promotion of democracy  respect for human rights and promotion of complete and harmonized development for all poor countries.The Government of Guatemala also reiterates its full support for the principles of international law governing relations among States: basically  self-determination of peoples  non-intervention  the legal equality of States  peaceful  just and negotiated settlement of international disputes and political and ideological pluralism  as bases for a democratically organized community of nations.I believe that  if political and economic relations among States were to be governed effectively by the principles enshrined in international law  which we have fully accepted in theory and enshrined in a large number of international instruments  there would be no hotbeds of tension and instability such as those that cause us to experience precarious peace with a constant danger of losing that peace. My government is convinced that peace  the highest aspiration of mankind  is the result  both domestically and internationally  of firm political will on the part of nations to achieve such peace through measures and agreements that basically seek reconciliation  tolerance  mutual respect and  above all  social justice. I believe deeply that only democracy as a system of government provides us with the basis and appropriate framework to seek peace  but democracy understood as a value and as a norm of conduct which is invariable  backed up in law and by a solid set of principles that fully guarantee the enjoyment of all freedoms. The most important challenge that has been confronted by the Government of Guatemala has been precisely that of strengthening democracy.Since the beginning of the mandate  which coincided with the entry into force of the present political constitution of the country  President Cerezo has established in the country a government oriented basically towards meeting the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population  which had traditionally been forgotten and left on the sidelines. The people since then have enjoyed all freedoms  which they have exercised fully through the strengthening of people’s organizations  whose legitimate aspirations form part of our nations priorities  reflected specifically in programmes directed towards meeting their most urgent needs.Dialogue has been intensified through forums for reconciliation  in which sectors convinced that dialogue is the only way to make progress politically are progressive participating. President Cerezo has demonstrated in practice what democracy is all about and has never resorted to coercive measures to resolve the political and social problems that he has had to confront throughout his administration.We are now in an open electoral process  a process that is free  pluralistic and participative and that will culminate  on 11 November  with the general elections. These elections are to take place in a democratic environment in which the political parties carry out their campaigns without any constraints. In order to strengthen the transparency of the electoral process  the Organization of American States has been invited to send observers  and also a large number of Governments of various parts of the world will by testifying to the honesty and cleanness of the elections.The National Commission of Reconciliation of Guatemala  in the framework of the Esquipulas II Agreements  with the full support of the Guatemala Government  took the initiative of promoting a process of dialogue between the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the various political  management and religious sectors and people’s representatives  as well as with the Government of the Republic  in order finding a political solution to our national problems  a solution that allows for reconciliation among Guatemalans and that therefore provides total peace for the country. This process of dialogue began in Oslo at the end of March this year between delegates of the National Commission of Reconciliation of Guatemala and those of the URNG. They continued at Madrid in June with representative of political parties from Guatemala  and at Ottawa at the beginning of September  with talks between the URNG and the private sector. A meeting is also planned to be held in Quito between URNG and the religious sectors of the country  as well as a meeting with the trade union sectors. This process of dialogue is the result of a national consensus  which is why it has been given the support of the Guatemalan population and of the international community.I should like to underscore and thank the Secretary-General for his resolute support for this process of dialogue in which he has participated as an observer  thus giving the process greater credibility and confidence as regards the commitments that have been achieved. The Guatemalan Government also expressed its appreciation to the Governments of Norway  Spain  Canada and Ecuador for their contribution to this process.The Central American region has in the past few decades been confronted with situations of crisis  instability and violence that have been an obstacle to its progress and that have meant the loss of valuable lives.On more than one occasion the results of the paths chosen by our Presidents to promote peace  democracy and security in Central America have been called into question. May I none the less say how very deeply pleased we are at the all important progress achieved towards the implementation of the peace agreement signed by the Central American Presidents  which has made it possible to see that  in spite of the long and difficult path followed  the obstacles encountered and the historic responsibility called for by the task  efforts have not been in vain and are yielding fruit.Proof of this can be found in the truly democratic political processes recently conducted in fraternal countries of the region  in the internal dialogue among irregular forces and Governments of Central American countries towards helping establish domestic peace and strengthening national reconciliation. We are please at the progress made in negotiations on security  verification  and the control and limitation of armaments in accordance with the Esquipulas II Agreements  and we trust that this will make it possible to reorient resources towards the development of Central America.These efforts on the part of the Governments of the region should be joined by those of the international community  which should give its support for the achievement of peace  stability and democracy in Central America. The actions of the United Nations and of the Organization of American States in respect of the peace process constitute unprecedented advances. The important diplomatic work done by the Costadora Group and its Support Group with a view to arriving at a peaceful  negotiated solution for peace and democracy and at reducing tension deserves our fullest appreciation. We are also grateful to other countries that have supported us throughout the process. The European Community  for its part  has  through the institutionalization of interregional relations  shown its readiness to support efforts to put an end to violence and instability in the Central American region. Against this background of improved political prospects for the region  and convinced that Central American presidential gathering are an appropriate means for analyzing and making decisions at the highest political level of our peoples  the Presidents of Central America welcomed the proposal of President Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo to hold an economic summit that would make it possible to deal with the grave economic and social situation of Central America. We believe that this presidential meeting will be the beginning of a second stage of the Esquipulas II process  in which the peace dividends will make it possible to reorient efforts and resources towards the expansion of our economies and the well-being of our peoples.The Central American Presidents took extremely important decisions in order to reorient the process of integration of the region as a means to achieving development  to achieve the inclusion of Central America in global economic  financial and technological trends  and to support and co-ordinate sectoral policy to promote economic growth  and to make it possible to bring social benefits to the people.In this context and in accordance with the request of the Central American Presidents for international assistance towards complementing our efforts  we Central Americans  who have already taken the initiative in choosing our path  must now reassess the support that the international community provides and offers to the region in order to make optimal use of that aid and to reorient it to the actual needs of the region in fulfillment of the presidential agreements. In this respect  the aid granted to the region by the European Community within the framework of co-operation signed in Luxembourg between the two regions in 1985 and aimed at social and economic development projects in the region deserves our attention.We agree with the new direction takes for community co-operation in support of the reactivation  restructuring and strengthening of the process of economic integration in Central America. This is reflected in the plan for the establishment of a regional system of payments  which will give new impetus to intraregional trade.Furthermore  the plan for special co-operation for Central America  the PECE  which arose in response to the appeal of the Central American Presidents at their summit meeting at Esquipulas II in order to obtain from the international community special support for the peace and development of the region should be promoted and adjusted to the actual requirements of the region in fulfillment of the Antigua commitments. In this context  the plan must continue and be given financial resources from the United Nations Development Programme so that it may be able to continue to function. We believe that other initiatives for co-operation with the region should be considered  such as the initiatives presented  by Colombia  Mexico and Venezuela – the Group of Three – the initiative of the International Commission for the Recovery and Development of Central America. Furthermore  in support of political changes which have taken place in Latin America and the Caribbean  the President of the United States of America recently announced a new programme for economic and financial relations between the United States and the Latin American and Caribbean region  known as the Initiative for the America. This is clearly an opportunity to promote the region’s prosperity and forma new American community. In principle  Central America has expressed its satisfaction at the prospects for this proposal  which we believe will help fulfill the agreements reached by the Central American Presidents in the plan of action adopted at their Antigua meeting. Guatemala has also reacted to the offer to support the protection of the environment by a mechanism for the exchange of bilateral debt for development projects.Central America must react positively to such an initiative. None the less it must use as its terms of reference the results of the Latin American countries which have already progressed in their negotiations in this direction. We must consider a joint strategy on the basis of its political and economic potential  and recognize that  as a bloc of countries  it will have better possibilities for facing future challenges in regard to economic  financial and trade matters and greater power of negotiation in the international context.It is important to highlight the validity  as of 1 May 1990  of the treaty establishing the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. The Parliament constitutes an institutional mechanism of a permanent nature for the strengthening of pluralist dialogue and democracy as fundamental elements for peace in the region. The Central American Parliament will also help promote and strengthen the process of Central American integration and encourage the broadest co-operation among member countries. The policy of the Guatemala Government in respect of human rights is firm and well defined. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its Sub-Commission for the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities have been examining the situation of human rights in Guatemala and have adopted resolutions in this regard. While it is true that those bodies have expressed their concern at the human rights situations in my country  it is also true that they have recognized the efforts being made by President Cerezo’s administration towards promoting and guaranteeing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Furthermore  both the Commission and the Sub-Commission and  in general  the international community are aware that there is no policy of violation of human rights in Guatemala. The Government of President Cerezo  therefore  reiterates  in this world forum  its unswerving commitment to respect human rights completely and to ensure their full exercise. The Government of Guatemala is therefore quite ready to continue to co-operate with the Commission and other serious bodies that have a genuine concern for human rights in our country  but we do reject the unjust campaign of disinformation that certain biased sectors are trying to conduct in an attempt to harass and single out Guatemala by painting an alarming picture of the human rights situation that does not in any way correspond to the reality.   Millions of human beings are wandering all over the world  victims of armed conflicts in their countries; others are victims of natural disasters; and others have left their homes because it has been impossible for them to rise above the poverty in which they were born. I am referring to refugees and displaced persons. The work of the United Nations through its High Commissioner for Refugees deserves our recognition. The Central American government are aware of the need to resolve this problem and to ensure to all Central Americans who return to their homes suitable conditions for their reintegration into national life. Guatemala feels encouraged to pursue this effort to solve the problem and it is grateful for the international support it has received. We are aware of the difficulties that need to be overcome  but we have the political will to resolve them and we declare once again the right of all Guatemalans living abroad to return to their homeland in conditions of freedom  security and respect for their human rights  so that they may be able to participate actively in national life. The Government of Guatemala is deeply concerned at the production and consumption of drugs and the illicit traffic in them. We have therefore taken a series of internal measures to combat this scourge. At the hemispheric level  we consider it necessary to strengthen the power of the Inter-American Commission for Drug Abuse Control  since all possible action must be taken to combat the ills related to drug trafficking. At the global level  my Government was one of the first to sign the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  which was adopted in Vienna at the end of 1988. It is my pleasure to report that we shall soon be ratifying that Convention. In short  both at the national and at the international level  the Government of Guatemala has maintained its unswerving resolve to fight openly against drug trafficking  since this is an extremely serious problem  one which constitutes a threat not only to peace but also to the stability of our institutions and our societies. The Government of Guatemala considers it necessary to establish  at the international level  mechanisms of co-operation for the rational use of natural resources  the control of pollution and the restoration of the ecological balance. We believe that poverty and the deterioration of the environment are closely interrelated and that it is necessary therefore to bear in mind the fact that protection of the environment constitutes an integral part of the development process. In this context  we fully support the decision of the United Nations to hold a conference  at the highest possible level  on the environment and development in Brazil  in June 1992.In order for peace to be lasting  it is necessary to encourage social development and the adoption of measure for the enhancement of the economic well-being of the neediest sectors of society. The situation that now prevails of differences between rich and poor nations can be seen  to a greater or a lesser degree  in all societies. It is time to piece the well-being and advancement of human beings at the centre of all our activities. The economic situation throughout the world continues to be adverse to the economic and social development of the developing countries. Guatemala is now facing one of the most severe economic crises in its history. That same situation prevails throughout the entire Central American region and the developing world at large. No short-term solution is in sight. The situation seems to worsen day after day. Foreign debt and its serving have made an already difficult situation worse. The magnitude and seriousness of this problem requires a broad and resolute approach  since this constitutes a grave threat to the political  social and economic order of many countries.It is a matter of concern that in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations the interests and concerns of the weakest developing countries are not being taken sufficiently into account. The objective of these negotiations should be to benefit all nations and to provide developing countries with access to existing trade blocs and also to new markets. Therefore  the needs of the developing countries must be duly taken into account.Guatemala considers that the United Nations is the appropriate forum in which to seek just solutions to shared problems  particularly in the economic field. There is a need for understanding and co-operation on the part of the economically stronger countries. It is urgent and necessary to continue a serious and constructive dialogue between developed and developing countries. It is unfortunate that the efforts made by the Group of 77 at the multilateral level have encountered obstacles that are now difficult to overcome. No significant progress was achieved at the special session devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  to the reactivation of economic growth and the development of the developing countries. We are therefore pleased at the decision to hold a special session of the Economic and Social Council at the ministerial level next year. This decision revitalizes that important body of the United Nations and will make it possible to set new policy guidelines in the economic and social sphere in the new context in which we are living.International peace and security have been endangered once again in the already torn region of the Middle East. Guatemala views with deep concern the conflict which arose on 2 August last when the armed forces of Iraq occupied the territory of Kuwait  forces which still remain there. Since the beginning of this conflict the Security Council has done work of an unprecedented nature. The agreement of the permanent members of the Security Council to go beyond the ideological differences has made it possible for them to agree on measures that emphasizes the rule of law  respect for international law and for the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter  norms which all sates that cherish peace must respect.Guatemala supports the collective measures adopted by the Council to prevent new threats to the peace and to eliminate existing ones through the application of measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. Guatemala has taken the necessary steps for full implementation of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council since the beginning of the conflict instigated by Iraq. We appeal to the Iraqi Government to desist from its attitude. Guatemala rejects any action aimed at the annexation of Kuwait and reiterates its appeal to Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Guatemala encourages the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue his tireless work of good offices aimed at the peaceful settlement of this conflict. Guatemala condemns the entry into and search of accredited diplomatic headquarters in Kuwait and considers unacceptable the use of civilian and diplomatic personnel as hostages. As stated by President Cerezo in this forum last year  Guatemala recognizes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence in their own territory  which does not compromise or affect the existence of the State of Israel within its borders as recognized by the United Nations. We are convinced that a political and negotiated solution to the problem of Palestine will certainly be a step towards a solution to the problem of the Middle East.The situation in Lebanon does not seem to be improving. The civil war continues to take lives and to render increasingly difficult the economic situation of the population. Guatemala appeals to the parties to the conflict to desist from their hostile attitude and to take conciliatory measures that could make it possible to establish the confidence necessary for negotiations and dialogue and to put an end to a war which has taken so many lives and which has caused so much suffering in that country. Peace-keeping operations will undoubtedly contribute to the reduction of budgets devoted to total destruction and to the arms race. The moral force of the United Nations is an additional guarantee of the transparency required for the peace process. It is also the most appropriate way to involve the international community in the restoration of international peace and security. Certainly this cannot be a solution to an existing problem  but it provides the time necessary for the reduction of tension and for the promotion of the mutual confidence-building measures that are necessary if we are to lay the foundations of a lasting and stable peace. Central American itself has benefited from the operations through the work done in the region by the United Nations Observer Group through the work of International Support and Verification Commission in the process of demobilization of the Nicaraguan resistance. It is a source of deep pride that  for the first time in history  we see United Nations operations promoting the total destruction of weapons.One region that could benefit from peace-keeping operations is South-East Asia  where there are encouraging signs of a peaceful solution.  We support the efforts being made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations to achieve a negotiated political solution to the conflict in Cambodia. We hope that the Paris Conference will be resumed so that the Khmer people may be enabled at last to enjoy peace  security and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.The United Nations has been called upon to participate in the referendum that is to be held to resolve the conflict of Western Sahara. Guatemala welcomes the joint agreement  the timetable and the plan approved in June by the Security Council. The referendum seems to be the most feasible means of resolving the Sahraoui conflict  and Guatemala supports the work done by the United Nations in this regard.Events in southern Africa deserve mention. We are very pleased at the liberation of Nelson Mandela and at the beginning of dialogue in South Africa. None the less  we note with concern that the complete and unconditional abolition of the odious system of apartheid practiced by the South African Government is being delayed. There can be no peace  nor can there by development  without the total abolition of apartheid as a system of government.The Guatemalan Government views with profound gratification the dialogue that has begun between North Korea and South Korea with a view to reconciliation and the reunification of the Korean peninsula. This intra-Korean dialogue contributes to détente and to the promotion of global peace. Guatemala believes that  within the United Nations principle of universality  it is appropriate that South Korea and North Korea be admitted to the Organization  within whose framework more significant progress in the process of dialogue between the two Koreas  with a view to ending confrontation and achieving unification  is feasible. Guatemala supports the efforts being made by the United Nations in the global disarmament campaign and associates itself with the appeal for the investment in the economic and social development of developing countries of all funds released by the reduction of nuclear arsenals. Guatemala  as a signatory to the Treaty of Tlatelolco  supports efforts to prohibit tests of all types of weapons of mass destruction and supports the use of outer space solely for peaceful purposes of benefit to all mankind. Guatemala supports the talks that the Government of the fraternal Republic of El Salvador  within the framework of the Esquipulas II agreement  is conducting with the armed opposition in that country. It is our hope that Salvadorians will find a negotiated political solution that can put an end to a decade of destruction and polarization in their society.Guatemala supports Haiti’s request that the United Nations organize an observer group for the election that are to be held in that country. We hope that the Haitian people will achieve the peace and internal reconciliation for which they yearn  enabling them to exercise freely their civil and political rights. In an effort to contribute to the important work of the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of disputes  the Guatemalan delegation has submitted a new item for consideration at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This item will be considered by the Sixth Committee. It is a draft of conciliation rules  whose objective is to promote the use of conciliation as an ad hoc means of resolving disputes between States. We believe that this may help the United Nations in its efforts to promote and maintain international peace and security. For reasons of State relating to the electoral process that is taking place in our country  President Cerezo could not be here. However  he asked me to convey to you  Mr. President  his warmest greetings and his best wishes for the success of the Assembly’s deliberations  as well as his solidarity with the decisions that are adopted in the search for peaceful and just solutions to the grave political  economic and social problems afflicting all mankind. May God be with you."
"63",2945,"GUY",45,1990,"﻿There is now abroad in the world a mood of optimism which  however cautious and restrained  now anticipates the installation of a new global order of peace and development. Engendered by the remarkable changes in East-West relations and other positive developments in the international sphere  this optimism is attended by a renewed faith in the United Regions as the central forum for inter-State co-operation. At this hopeful juncture therefore the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session will be expected to analyse the prevailing world situation and to explore the building of a new and better world. We are confident that  under the able guidance of Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta  it will not fail to do so.I therefore wish to extend to Mr. de Marco  on behalf of my delegation  our warmest congratulations and good wishes for a successful presidency. His distinguished career leaves us in no doubt as to the effective conduct of our deliberations. In saluting him I also wish to pay a tribute to his predecessor in office. Major General Joseph Garba  for the dynamic leadership he provided during the past year. May I also avail myself of this opportunity to convey to the Secretary-General my Government’s appreciation of the active role which he continues to play in strengthening the institutional capacity of the United Nations fully to address the concerns and aspirations of its membership. To our newest Member State  the Principality of Liechtenstein  I extend a very warm welcome. Me are also particularly pleased to recognise in our midst today the delegation of Namibia  which is participating in this regular session of the General Assembly as a sovereign State of the international community.As we meet on this occasion  the clouds of yet another war have gathered ominously over the Gulf  casting a pall on the optimism which I noted at the outset of my statement. The Iraq-Kuwait conflict which erupted unexpectedly on the eve of this session of the Assembly now threatens to escalate to a wider confrontation. The Security Council has already acted swiftly and decisively to restrain this jarring aggression. It has rightly condemned the acquisition of territory by force and stressed the need for the peaceful settlement of all disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The matter has now engaged the attention of the Assembly  we must reaffirm the Council's stern condemnation of the use of force and call for the urgent restoration of peace.It would be disastrous  in our view  if this intemperate aggression were to jeopardise the prospects we now have of creating a new and better system of international relations. The astonishing changes occurring around the globe - in Europe especially  but also in other regions - have revealed new political and economic horizons  which  although not clearly discernible  none the less hold the promise of growing interdependence among nations. Our expectation was - and still is - that peace and development would now be allowed to prosper throughout the world.My own delegation believes that the changes that have occurred are by and large positive; but that their potential for good can be realized only if they are properly harnessed and oriented. In this belief we prefer to think that the Gulf crisis is but a thoughtless and temporary aberration from the current trend towards dialogue  the pacific settlement of disputes  and international co-operation. If anything  therefore  this unfortunate crisis must hasten our efforts to build a new order that could possibly eliminate such acts of aggression and allow all peoples to concentrate on their peaceful development.The international community should thus move swiftly to defuse the Iraq-Kuwait conflict by adhering scrupulously to the blueprint of action outlined in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. An important prerequisite is the immediate withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. The acquisition of territory by force is unequivocally condemned by the Charter of the United Nations and can in no way be justified or tolerated.Once withdrawal has taken place  a mechanism for dialogue and negotiation could be created to deal with the underlying causes of the conflict and ultimately to find a just and acceptable solution. It may then be appropriate to consider the holding of an international peace conference charged with finding a comprehensive settlement to the problems of the Middle East  at the core of which remains the question of Palestine.The issues involved are complex and deeply rooted. Nevertheless  with a large measure of political will  it is yet possible to reach a basis for dialogue and negotiation. The United Nations may play a helpful role in organising such a forum in a manner which enjoys the confidence of all the parties concerned. Given the remarkable success achieved thus far by the international community in the peaceful settlement of regional disputes  we cannot easily contemplate failure in the Middle East.For example  the long struggle for Namibia's independence was brought to a peaceful end through negotiations between the parties concerned. The United Nations was a major catalyst of this process and by its provisional transition assistance created the circumstances in which the Namibian people proceeded to freedom. That happy outcome has since given rise to expectations that the distressing situation in South Africa itself - where apartheid's fortress is still standing - will also be resolved by further concerted international efforts. To guarantee such success  however  we must ensure that the full pressure of sanctions is maintained in order to bring about the desired end. Elsewhere in Africa  in the Western Sahara a plan has been approved by the Security Council which offers a distinct opportunity for finally resolving that protracted dispute. In Asia  more specifically in Afghanistan  the Geneva Agreements which were negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations appear to have paved the way for national reconciliation and reconstruction. There should now be no deviation from these accepted goals.Similarly  the Cambodian question  which has long defied solution  is now within reach of a promising settlement. The plan devised by the Security Council in consultation with the parties involved has commanded wide acceptance and is ready to be implemented. The role required of the United Nations is highly challenging but it is one which  with the full support of the international community  it is capable of playing.We have also witnessed in this forum the joyful reunification of the Yemeni people and of the German people. We are now seeing the positive  though tentative  steps recently taken by the two sides in the Korean question. Although it has long been agreed that the reunification of Korea should be carried out peacefully and without outside interference  its achievement has eluded us. 9fe urge the Korean people to accelerate the process of dialogue they have begun. Furthermore  we pose the question whether an elevation of participation in this Organisation might not be a positive contribution to this process.Even in the recalcitrant region of the Middle East  we have witnessed the termination of the obdurate Iran-Iraq war. Close by  however  in the Mediterranean  the problem of Cyprus has not yet proved amenable to negotiations. Despite the best endeavours of the Secretary-General and several worthwhile initiatives  the two sides remain apart. It is to be hoped that with the continuing intervention of the Security Council a new impetus will toe given to co-operation  compromise and reconciliation so that the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus may be preserved. Finally  here in this hemisphere the United Nations has also been instrumental in the attenuation of conflict in Central America  a region long racked by internecine strife and appalling poverty  a process of determined negotiation and patient international co-operation has at last been rewarded with prospects o£ a definitive and lasting peace. Through observation and verification of agreements by the States concerned the United Nations has provided conditions of stability in which peace and development may be promoted. Such has been the success of this operation that consideration is now being given to its replication elsewhere.Indeed  this impressive record of achievement by the United Nations in the important areas of peace-making and peace-keeping to which I have briefly alluded amply demonstrates its capability  both actual and potential  for preserving international security. In the new situation that has been created by the growing rapprochement between the East and West and a corresponding willingness to accelerate the process of disarmament  it is now possible to conceive of multilateral arrangements to fill any vacuum that may be created by the disappearance of military blocs. Such arrangements would in our view provide for a system of collective security that could effectively serve to deter future threats of aggression and upon which all nations could rely for protection from attacks on their sovereignty and territorial integrity.This idea  whose time appears to have come  is frontally addressed in the thought-provoking report submitted by the Secretary-General on the Organisation's work. Evidently based on his personal experience  the suggestions include  inter alia  a strengthening of the peace-making capacity of the Security Council  an enhanced role for the Secretary-General  the enforcement of United Nations decisions  greater recourse to the International Court of Justice in cases of legal dispute  and the use of regional arrangements  wherever appropriate  to buttress United Nations machinery. These proposals are by no means novel; they have in fact been bandied about in several attempts at strengthening the United Nations. However  the present political conjuncture  in which nation States appear more disposed to international co-operation  is especially favourable to a serious examination of the feasibility of their implementation. We urge that those proposals be revisited.It must be realized  however  that peace and development are indivisible. Global security cannot be achieved without the establishment of a more equitable economic relationship between States and the solution of the world's pressing social problems. Therefore  while we welcome the progress that has taken place in the political field  we must nevertheless deplore the fragile economic and social conditions in which peace has to be pursued. Today  developing countries stand trapped between possible recession in major industrialized countries and the stifling constraints of their own weak economies. They continue to feel the severe strain of their increasing debt burden  despite the welcome adoption of progressive policies by some creditor countries and other financial entities. At this point  therefore  we cannot be sanguine about their economic future. According to the recent United Nations World Economic Survey  global economic growth  which slowed in 1989  is expected to slow even further this year. An increased contraction in world trade  rising interest rates and the weakening of commodity prices will all conspire to frustrate recovery and growth in the developing countries. This dismal situation is now further worsened by the impact of spiralling energy costs that developing countries simply cannot afford. The Gulf crisis has thus taken additional hostages  namely the peoples of the third world  whose beleaguered economies have been forced even further back along the path of underdevelopment.The implications of the current socio-economic situation for international peace and security are therefore disturbing. Imbalances in the world economy wreak their own social havoc and ultimately threaten the very stability we seek. Even as old battles are ended  new sources of conflict are emerging  and increasingly we see that these are not ideological or political  but economic in nature. The peace equation cannot be solved unless our economic and social concerns are factored in. There must therefore be joint action by both developed and developing countries to ensure that political progress is matched by economic and social development.We are especially happy to note in this regard that the Declaration which emerged from the special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation  in April this year  takes full cognisance of that requirement and consequently of the urgent need to revitalise the economic development of the developing countries. In a rare display of unity  both developing and developed countries agreed in that document to the pursuit of policies necessary to the recovery and sustained growth of the world economy. Its spirit and letter should now inspire and guide us as we engage in a dialogue aimed at furthering international economic co-operation. That joint commitment should also find reflection in the strategy for the fourth development decade the adoption of which  I understand  is imminent. That document  the product of extensive consultations and negotiations  reflects the immediate direction of international co-operation. Clearly  it cannot be said to go as far as developing countries world wish  but if followed it can lead to an improvement in the conditions for development  - In the particular area of trade  we await the final outcome of the Uruguay Round of negotiations which  however  shows no sign so far of any significant concessions. Common necessity  however  must in our view lead both the developing and the developed countries to expend areas of trade co-operation  since this is the recognised key to the future of the global economy.It is further encouraging to note that the international community  in the face of other major problems such as drug trafficking and the environment  has been fully galvanised into a united effort to deal with the harmful consequences of those problems. Beyond their domestic campaigns  States have worked assiduously at the bilateral  regional and international levels to devise strategies aimed at preserving their societies from further encroachment. The special session on drug trafficking  which was held in New York last year  undoubtedly stimulated increased global attention to the rampant drug trade and suggested additional ways  such as  for example  the creation of an international criminal court  to combat its vicious spread. The outcome of that session represents an admirable example of how nations threatened by a common enemy can come together in defence of their mutual welfare.Encouraged by that experience  we now look forward to the World Conference on Environment and Development  which is scheduled to be held in Brazil in 1992 and which we trust will produce  as the Vienna Conference did for the drug problem  a  comprehensive programme to protect and preserve the environment. Such it its own commitment to this goal that my country has sought  in advance of that important forum and in co-operation with the Commonwealth  to build a model utilising an area of our forests - almost a million acres - to establish the feasibility of sustainable development in a properly managed environment. It is our humble view that such efforts  if emulated and replicated elsewhere  will help considerably to save the global commons.In the light of the increasing globalisation of the issues to which I have adverted  it is clear that a new world order is no longer a vague desideratum; it is now an urgent necessity. The traditional methods of managing human affairs have become patently inadequate to the circumstances of this generation. For while man has had the ingenuity to conquer outer space  he has apparently yet to dominate the Barth and all its problems. It is as if the human mind having transcended its terrestrial confines  is incapable now of dealing with the mundane issues of life. And yet unless he can overcome the limitations of his otherwise marvellous scientific and technological accomplishments  all his efforts will have been in vain and he himself will have been placed at the risk of extinction.That frightening realisation must surely coeps1 us to accept the urgency of a global perestroika aimed at creating a new and functional international system based on the premises of interdependence and collective responsibility. Such a system  if it is to work  must be entirely democratic in nature and must revolve around the United Nations  the Organisation we have together devised to pursue our common objectives. Experience has shown that while it is by no means perfect the United Nations is an instrument whose potential for promoting international co-operation is vast  we must therefore explore its limits to the full. Equally important  we must work to ensure that it is endowed with strength and vitality and is fully capable of undertaking the many responsibilities continuously being entrusted to it.	We must also be ever mindful of the fact that s strong United Nations can emerge and thrive only in an international environment where the rule of law prevails. Violations such as that committed in the Gulf strike not only at international peace and security but also at the fundamental bases of our Organisation. The principles of the Charter  which proscribe the use of force in international relations  are sacrosanct and should not be violated with impunity. The transgression must therefore be dealt with condignly whenever and wherever it occurs.Only a week ago  some 73 Heads of State or Government came together in New York to draw attention to the plight of the world's children. It was the most impressive demonstration of the priority which world leaders are now prepared to give to critical humanitarian concerns. Children  after all  represent the future of humanity  and yet they continue to be the innocent and principal victims of all forms of aggression. As was stated in the 1990 report of the United Nations Children's Fund on the state of the world's children  it is the poorest and most vulnerable children who are paying the third world's debt: ""with the sacrifice of their normal growth  with their health and with the loss of their opportunity to be educated"".It cannot do to expose our future so continuously to such hazards.If that Summit is to mean something  and if we are to save future generations from the scourge of war and poverty  we must act promptly to install the new order of which we have spoken. It is only by so doing that we can redress the grave imbalances which exist in the current order and which are the root cause of the world's major problems. In that respect it is extremely heart-warming to hear both Powers - the United States and the USSR - now acknowledging the need for such an order. Their newly found entente has opened up new vistas for international co-operation in every field and has thus brought hope to a world now in despair. It offers  in short  a singular opportunity for human progress. Let us  therefore  not waste it through indecision and inaction. "
"64",2990,"HND",45,1990,"﻿At the outset  I should like on behalf of the people and the Government of Honduras to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are convinced that your experience and ability will greatly contribute to the success of the Assembly's work. Similarly  I should like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the excellent job he has been doing in that very complex and delicate post. We Latin Americans are particularly proud of his achievements at the helm of the Secretariat.We wish also to express a cordial welcome to Liechtenstein  a new Member of the Organization.Forty-five years ago  in the aftermath of the Second World War  my country helped lay the groundwork for what became the United Nations. The San Francisco Conference  although held on the still smouldering embers of that terrible conflict took place in an atmosphere of faith and hope. The very fact that the Conference was held is proof that humanity  aware of its creative capacity  had faith that it could build new instruments that would promote understanding and concord among peoples. At the start of this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  we can be optimistic that those noble goals can be achieved. A cursory review of the main events of the year that has elapsed since the last session - a year which by any measure was exceptional - supports that view.Indeed  we are pleased that positive achievements have marked the political dialogue with South Africa  bringing closer to realization the goal that the odious policy of apartheid - which the Government and the people of Honduras unreservedly condemn - will be abolished in the near future. Today  forty-five years later  humanity is witnessing the advent of a new climate of detente and concord  thanks to the changes that have taken place internationally. Mutual respect among nations and efforts to check armaments and the causes of economic and social development are now the rule and not the exception. The participation of the United Nations in the creation of this new climate  which is giving rise to a promising new era  has undoubtedly been a major factor.The United Nations was conceived as a tool for the maintenance of peace  to ensure human rights and promote the development and well-being of peoples through international co-operation. My presence here in the General Assembly  the first time a President of Honduras has come to this forum  should be taken as an expression of the renewed confidence of the people and the Government of Honduras in our Organization and in its capacity to achieve the purposes for which it was established.After nearly five decades of separation  the German people has once again become reunited in a single State. One of the most tragic consequences of the Second World War has thus been finally removed. The people and the Government of Honduras most warmly welcome that peaceful  notable development  which strengthens stability in Europe and opens up new prospects for international co-operation. In the Far East  political co-operation to resolve the long and bloody conflict in Cambodia has made significant progress  and we should encourage such co-operation until the confrontation is at an end and we have built a new era of national reconciliation. As regards the dialogue between the two Korean States  Honduras supports it unreservedly. However  if  in acknowledgement of their peoples' efforts  they so desire  my country would recommend that the Republic of Korea be accepted as a Member of our Organization. In our opinion  it has already met the requirements for membership.It is with special pleasure that I also welcome the independence of Namibia and the incorporation of that new State into the United Nations. We are convinced that its co-operation will help to promote the objectives of our Organization  whose exemplary role in connection with the elections and the peaceful transition of Namibia to political power we shall always appreciate.The changes in Eastern Europe have removed boundaries between protagonists and had a positive impact on the entire world in every imaginable area. The lesson of these changes is that peaceful transformation  dialogue and tolerance should be pursued in both domestic and international affairs. What has happened in Eastern Europe confirms that freedom and the right to self-determination of peoples  guiding ideas of this Organization  are the best guarantee for the achievement of a better world for everyone.Recently we have observed  with indignation and surprise  the invasion of a Member State of the Organization  Kuwait  by another  Iraq  using its military superiority and trying to convert that country into another of its provinces. It is obvious that this action is contrary to the elementary rules of peaceful coexistence and a violation of the dearest principles of our Organization and those of the international community: that is  respect for integrity and national sovereignty  non-intervention and the right to self-determination of peoples. The importance of these principles is such that failure to respect them would take us back to the most obscure and tragic times of history  when might made right and held sway over the rule of law. From this point of view  my country  whose security rests primarily on the norms of international law  has condemned the invasion of Kuwait and has offered its modest support in integrating a multinational peace force  under the flag of the United Nations  to help to restore the tranquillity of that part of the world. Our most fervent desire is that diplomatic action will prove sufficient to preserve peace and lead to the establishment of the rule of reason and law in the Persian Gulf region. We applaud the resolutions adopted by the Security Council  which show that the world is united against the aggression and make clear Iraq's obligation to abide by those resolutions.The long decades of confrontation that we have experienced have caused the world to postpone the basic efforts necessary for dealing with its primary challenges that is  raising the standards of living of hundreds of millions of human beings who still subsist in conditions of extreme poverty. In our opinion  the dividends of peace must be invested in the best possible way  and that means giving a life of dignity to the dispossessed of the world. That is the only way to guarantee the maintenance of peace and ensure that the old differences between East and West will not be supplanted by a new form of tension  this time between the North and the South. In this undertaking  our Organization must play a pre-eminent role. The United Nations has the necessary dedication and infrastructure to play a greater part in the economic and social progress of all the peoples of the world. The United Nations has become a universal body with the capacity to channel the efforts of the international community in the fight against underdevelopment. It is now for the Member States  particularly those of the industrialized world  to express their solidarity and determination by granting more resources for use in meeting this challenge. This undertaking is particularly urgent. In recent years the world situation has led to a deterioration in the standards of living of many developing countries. The decline in the prices of the export products of the third world  the increased prices of imported goods  the increased price of oil  adverse climatic conditions and the heavy burden of servicing external debt - these have combined seriously to undermine the already precarious standards of living in many countries. Additionally  the measures of economic adjustment we have taken in many cases have led to even greater sacrifices.I believe that in the present situation the international community  acting together  must assume its responsibility and draw up a great plan of action to wipe out poverty everywhere in the world. The success of the Marshall Plan  carried out at the conclusion  of the Second World War  is proof that concerted action of this kind can lead to real improvements in the medium term of the standard of living of peoples. We need credits and technology to increase production; we need markets for our products and facilities to make possible the repayment of our external debt without demands being made for further sacrifices from our peoples. This task can be carried out only with the collaboration of all States of the world.In the course of the past decade hundreds of thousands of citizens of neighbouring countries sought refuge in Honduras  fleeing the violence caused by conflicts in their countries of origin. The burden on Honduras of these thousands of Central American refugees for so many years has been alleviated largely because of the opportune assistance of the international community  particularly that rendered by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This valuable co-operation is still being given to us today to facilitate the repatriation still taking place as the security in neighbouring countries is improving. Assistance is also being given in areas where many of the refugees are located  in improving the conditions for development there; in many cases their presence has had an adverse effect on the environment.It is only right at this time to express the sincere appreciation of the people and Government of Honduras to those countries that have given us co-operation in dealing with this problem and also to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the humanitarian assistance given to us during these difficult years.Since the end of the decade of the 1970s  the Central American isthmus has suffered the effects of bloody conflicts which have occurred primarily in two of the countries of that area. With the passing of time the consequences of those conflicts went beyond the borders of the countries directly concerned and were felt throughout Central America. These effects  however  had the virtue of awakening the Governments of the area to the conviction that it was necessary to resolve the crisis through dialogue  negotiation and joint action. This undertaking  in which Central Americans found solidarity and support from almost all of the international community  was aimed primarily at eliminating the conflicts which had taken place in the countries of the area and preventing further confrontations among the various States.In signing the Esquipulas Agreements  Central Americans laid the ground work for real national reconciliation among those groups that had been engaged in armed struggle and also laid the groundwork for real democracy. Furthermore  the Governments of the region agreed to carry out a number of actions aimed at improving the standard of living of their people. The agreements signed by the Central American Presidents had the immediate effect of reducing tensions in the area  in Nicaragua leading to the installation of a Government freely elected by the people. In this respect  I can say with satisfaction that from the beginning my Government adopted a policy which made it possible to abide by the commitments set forth in the Esquipulas procedures  and we worked with the parties concerned in Nicaragua to complete a number of agreements  initiated on 23 March 1990  leading to the disarming and demobilization of the Nicaraguan resistance and to the repatriation of members and families. Good-neighbourliness between Nicaragua and Honduras was thus restored.In El Salvador negotiations with the aim of a peaceful settlement of the conflict  with the invaluable mediation of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  have yielded early results  although  regrettably  these have not been as widespread as we had hoped. The only path to peace and reconciliation is through dialogue  and I again appeal to the parties for the speedy cessation of hostilities  which will enable the Salvadorian people to bind their wounds and build a future of freedom  justice and solidarity.To prevent the risk of further armed conflicts among States  we are attempting to reduce the size and offensive capacity of the armies of Central America. In this we are also guided by our desire to use our meagre economic resources to improve the living conditions of our people.We are working to adopt measures to promote confidence among our States  to develop border areas and to improve the environment  and in many other areas of common interest. Our objective is to strengthen union and promote interdependence among the countries of the area.To that end in our work programmes a prominent role is given to Central American integration - certainly our most viable option in building a better future.At the recent meeting of Central American Presidents we stressed our belief in. integration as a means of development and said we wanted a Central America linked to the rest of the world on the basis of fruitful and respectful interdependence.We believe that the Economic Community of the Central American Isthmus should be founded on a redesigned juridical and legal framework; the present limitations must be overcome. We wish to put into effect the new strategies of openness and productive modernization we have drawn up. As we design a new scheme for Central American integration  we are taking into account the errors of the past and the need not to repeat them. We know our principal objective must be to improve the living standards of Central Americans. We also know that the costs and benefits of integration must be shared equitably so that the process will not again be interrupted. At the meeting in Antigua  Guatemala  the Central American Presidents reiterated their appeal to the international community for the co-operation we need to make our development a reality. This support is particularly important if we are to sustain efforts to relieve the burden of external debt and thus free the resources needed to develop the region.As we have searched for peace we Central Americans have worked with the United Nations  which has always been present.From this rostrum  in 1988  the Government of Honduras proposed the establishment of machinery sponsored by our Organization. That machinery was to serve to ensure compliance with the Esquipulas Agreements. The proposal by Honduras gave rise to the international Commission for Support and Verification and the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ОGСА) whose participation in the bringing of peace to the region has been and continues to be particularly valuable. The receptiveness of the United Nations to the proposal by Honduras made it possible for us to go beyond the impasse that then existed in Central America and furthered our negotiating efforts. ONUCA can now help supervise the security agreements to be reached by the parties to the conflict  and its mandate must be renewed and expanded in the proper terms.Similarly  in 1988 the General Assembly  aware that peace in our region required improved living standards for the inhabitants  approved a special plan for economic co-operation for Central America to improve technical  economic and financial co-operation for the Central American region.Central Americans hope that that plan  now being implemented  can  with the goodwill and support of friendly Governments and international organizations  prove to be a firm support for our peace efforts. I do not wish to conclude without referring to the fundamental role being played by the Secretary-General in this process. We wish here to express the thanks of the Government of Honduras for his constant willingness to go Central America whenever necessary to help contribute to the settlement of the crisis  through personal dedication and the dedication of his associates led to a further chapter of success in the history of the Organization as it works towards achievement of its fundamental objectives.I should like again to express my hope that the United Nations will emerge strengthened and that peace in the world will be consolidated for the benefit of all peoples."
"65",3059,"HTI",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Haitian delegation  may I first of all extend to Mr. Guido de Marco most cordial congratulations on being chosen unanimously to direct the work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are very pleased about this election  convinced as we are that his outstanding personal qualities and his great experience in international problems are the best guarantee of the success of our work.I would be remiss if I did not also pay a tribute to Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria  whose energy  efficacy and moderation earned him the respect and admiration of everyone during the last session. We also congratulate the Secretary-General. Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  who deserves our recognition for the successes achieved by the United Nations in recent years. His latest report on the state of the world rightly emphasizes the new opportunities emerging at the dawn of this decade.We welcome with great satisfaction the admission of Namibia and Liechtenstein as full Members of our Organisation.Forty-five years after the creation of the United Nations  historical events are accelerating rapidly. The cold war is almost over  as the recent treaty on the final settlement of the question of Germany has shown. There are encouraging signs of solutions to problems on all continents  which only yesterday were criss-crossed by many conflicts that by force of circumstance had become stakes in the East-West competition. The cause of peace continues to make progress. The same is true of democracy  which has remodelled the post-war political and ideological landscape.But no one can underestimate the potential of conflicts threatening this new peace dynamic. From Liberia to Ethiopia  from Central America to Afghanistan  many hotbeds of tension remain  quite apart from a large number of local or regional conflicts that for the past four decades the United Nations has been unable to prevent or control.Moreover  the storm currently ¡raging in the Arab  Persian Gulf is an unprecedented threat to world peace.Along with those uncertainties  the growth of extreme poverty in the countries of the South dramatically emphasises that the international economic crisis is not over - quite the contrary.The international community is now living in a time of a dual contrast  between peace and war and between the economic euphoria in the North and the growing impoverishment of the South. It is against that background that the General Assembly is beginning its forty-fifth session  whose work should have a lasting effect on the new decade  full of so many challenges.Exactly two months ago the whole world was plunged into a state of shock the premeditated aggression against the sovereignty of Kuwait initiated the gravest crisis in the past 20 years. The invasion became annexation. They are equally unacceptable in law and international morality. Unless there is a radical change  there is the risk that the logic of war which seems to prevail will commit us to a military confrontation  with unpredictable consequences.In the face of that danger  the Republic of Haiti urges the United Nations to play to the utmost its unique role of trying to avert the major conflict that the whole world so much fears. We believe that a spreading conflagration is not inevitable  so long as the party primarily concerned decides to admit its errors and to respect the principles of the United Nations Charter which have been so flagrantly violated.In that connection  we believe there are two basic requirements the complete restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty  without any reservation  and the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupation forces  reflecting the status quo of 1 August 1990. We should give diplomacy a chance to attain those objectives through negotiations  in accordance with Security Council resolution 660 (1990) and subsequent Council decisions  all of which have the firm support of the Haitian Government.Clearly  for a peaceful outcome of the conflict Iraq must take the first steps towards a negotiated settlement. Therefore  the Republic of Haiti joins the unanimous appeal to the Government of Iraq to heed the voice of wisdom and reason. It is not too late.Still with regard to the Middle East  we cannot overlook the deadlock in thesearch for a solution to the Israeli-Arab question  which has been aggravated by violence that has been endemic for three years now in the occupied territories presenting another major challenge to peace. Hopes of progress towards a solution seen to depend on the opening of a dialogue between all the interested parties  especially between the Israelis and the Palestinians  within the framework of negotiations acceptable to both parties. In any event  the Haitian Government strongly supports the efforts already initiated with a view to beginning a negotiation process on the basis of commonly acknowledged principles  contained in particular in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). For it should be repeated that the key to any solution lies in Israel's right to live in peace within secure borders  internationally recognised and guaranteed  and in the Palestinian people's exercise of its legitimate rights to a homeland and self-determination.The Republic of Haiti cannot remain indifferent to the fate of Lebanon  threatened with disintegration because of a bloody and unceasing tragedy. In that friendly country we have witnessed with alarm successive violations  which remain unpunished  of the basic principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. While condemning such acts  whatever the reasons given by those responsible  the Haitian Government calls for respect for the relevant United Nations resolutions  so that the Lebanese people may finally  after the torment of the past 15 years  regain control of their destiny  with full territorial integrity.The struggle for peace in the Middle East  with which Haiti fully associates itself  is part of a larger picture the creation during the current decade of an international environment in which war may finally be outlawed. Although the world's attention has rightly been upon the Gulf crisis  there has recently been an exceptional improvement in the international climate with regard to the maintenance of peace. That is especially true of the situation in southern Africa. The year now coming to an end has seen Namibia gain its independence after a long decolonisation process in which the United Nations played a key role - and we pay it a public tribute for that.There was a first glimmer of hope in South Africa with the freeing of Nelson Mandela and his comrades in the struggle. Praiseworthy initiatives have since been made by the South African Government. Nevertheless  the risk of civil were threatening that country has lessened the prospects of a rapid dismantling of the apartheid system  whose structure remains basically unchanged. The Republic of Haiti  because of its very nature  endorsed the aspirations of the black majority of South Africa and the struggle of its liberation movements. We believe it to be our duty once again to call for the continuation of sanctions against the Pretoria regime until it shows proof of its determination to put an end to its universally condemned policy.The Haitian Government welcomes the outline of a national solution to the crises that have torn Angola and Mozambique since their independence.Similarly  the efforts to settle the question of Western Sahara seem to give us reason for hope. The Haitian Government continues to hope that a solution will be found taking fully into account the inalienable right of the Saharan people to self-determination  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.Similarly  we note with satisfaction the progress achieved towards a settlement of the conflicts in Asia. Under the auspices of the United Nations and with the tireless support of France - to which we would like to pay a tribute for its sustained activities - an overall settlement of the issue of Cambodia seems to be at hand. The Republic of Haiti is pleased for the Khmer people  which after so great a struggle is now emerging from a long nightmare.Furthermore  in view of the recent developments in the Korean peninsula  the time seems to have come for the Republic of Korea finally to be admitted as a full-fledged member of the great family of the United Nations. Haiti fully supports its aspirations.Closer to home on the American continent  Central America  after being a bloody pawn in East-West rivalry for more than a decade  has committed itself to the Esquipulas II Treaty and the guest for a peaceful solution to the many conflicts there and the building of a new democratic order. In this regard too we should emphasise that  to its credit  the United Nations has lived up to its mission. The Republic of Haiti hopes it will continue to help the Central American nations finally to put an end to the suffering caused by civil war and  above all  to find a way to development - the essential element of peace  without which any democratic endeavour would be illusory.We also wish to emphasise the exceptional factors that have come together and fostered the dawning of freedom in the East and boundless prospects for stability  security and peace in Europe. The Haitian Government and people would like to hail  first and foremost  the consecration today of German unification - an outstanding symbol of the beginning of a new age for Europe and the world as a whole.Finally  the Republic o£ Haiti is pleased at the incontestable progress achieved in the limitation of the chemical  bacteriological and nuclear arms race. The excellent steps that the super-Powers have been taking for some time now are full of promise. For us  as for the entire third world  there is much hope of achieving real disarmament. This closely affects prospects for improving the living conditions of hundreds of millions of human beings now suffering or dying of hunger. As is rightly recalled in the latest report of the World Bank on development  any reduction by 10 per cent of military expenditures by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (HATO) would automatically involve a doubling of official assistance  if that is indeed desired.In that regard  we support the recent appeal of the Secretary-General for increased assistance to the emerging democracies of the third world  whose peoples should not be tempted to associate democracy with dire poverty and misery  as was so rightly emphasized by Mr. Perez de Cuellar.It is time we realized that democracy also has an essential socio-economic dimension  without which it loses its raison d'être.The Haitian delegation cannot fail to express its concern and bitterness in the face of the growing economic gap and disparities between North and South. The vigorous economic expansion that has taken place in the past eight years has become the norm for the industrialized world. As a hostage to this growth  perhaps it is no longer development but stagnation and regression that have been the lot of most third world nations. It suffices to consider the spectacular decline of the average income in Latin America  which is at a level lower than that of 20 years ago.The situation in sub-Saharan Africa and in so-called least developed countries is the most cruel example of this. In the face of the growing complexity of the problems facing the third world  which in fact have affected the prospects for lasting peace  we are all bound to note the need for a critical examination of the policies and machinery that gave rise to the enormous confusion of the 1980s  which have quite rightly been called the lost decade.In that regard  the Haitian delegation believes it must emphasize some of the serious setbacks that have come about as regards the objectives of the international development strategy of the past decade.First  official assistance has never achieved the desired objectives in terms of volume  and has most often been simply a palliative racier than input that was indispensable for lasting development.Secondly  for very dubious reasons we have too often seen the freezing of vital programmes of co-operation  sometimes unilaterally and selectively  by creditors  when the extremely vulnerable economies of our countries need public assistance that is both stable and predictable.Thirdly  many constraints have been imposed from abroad  stemming in particular from rigorously applied programmes of structural adjustment at the cost of abandonment of essential social services and cessation of productive investment. But instead of the co-operation that we expected in return  the countries concerned have only been offered the prospect of market forces  as if they are our fragile economies' only hope of salvation in facing the challenges of underdevelopment.Finally  how could we fail to emphasize the stranglehold of debt-servicing and the problem of the inverse transfer of resources and the drop in commodity prices  which are now lower than they have been in 30 years?It is not surprising that the economic recovery of the North has not trickled down to the South as expected.That is why the Haitian delegation believes that the question of the establishment of a new international economic order is still a timely one  for at the beginning of this decade it seems to us there may be no more urgent task than that of attacking the structural causes of the poverty and underdevelopment raging in the third world. We believe in this respect that it is necessary to adopt a series of priority measures  in particular the following:First  a significant increase in financial facilities for development financing;Second  the establishment of a system of international co-operation that takes fully into account the specific problems of the most vulnerable countries and those countries most affected by the current crisis  especially the least developed ones;Third  special support for developing countries that have been affected to help them deal with the substantial increase in energy costs;Fourth  equitable treatment of external indebtedness;Fifth  a restructuring of multilateral institutions  whose role in development financing should be in full accordance with the objectives assumed by the United Nations;Sixth  a revitalizing of South-South co-operation and the process of regional integration;Seventh  the entry into force  so often postponed of the common fund for commodities.That having been said  we cannot fail to pay a tribute to the many efforts made in various places that have clearly shown that the idea of enlightened international solidarity is not a dead letter. An example is the new programme of action adopted at the recent Paris Conference on the Least Developed Countries. The steps taken by France to cancel the debt for those countries constitute a positive change. It is incumbent on the international community to make those changes a reality. The General Assembly has already been seized of a request from the provisional Government of Haiti on the organisation of forthcoming elections. I would be remiss if I did not refer to the situation prevailing in Haiti today  a major multi-dimensional crisis has afflicted Haiti for more than four years now. After the fall of dictatorship the Haitian people regained its public freedoms and clearly demonstrated its refusal to return to it. Since 7 February 1986  the date of liberation  various Government formulas have failed in the face of the irrepressible desire for change expressed by the Haitian people. This period of searching has given rise to a whole series of difficulties for the economy and the good name of Haiti. The abortive elections of 29 November 1987 constituted one of the saddest such episodes. Since then  in addition to the massive disinvestment that resulted  an almost total freeze on public development assistance has strengthened and intensified the national trauma provoked by that unspeakable act. The Haitian people have been noting with anger the increased degradation of the infrastructures. Illiteracy  which is now at 80 per cent  has not been reduced. Even hope - which brought the Haitian nation onto a new path - has now been threatened. It is in order to stop this vicious circle that the Provisional Government of the Republic  which resulted from a broad  national consensus  has committed itself firmly to putting the nation  amidst all these difficulties  onto the path to free and honest elections which have for too long been postponed.That is why since its coming to power the Government of Her Excellency  Mrs. Ertha Pascal-Trouillot  while endeavouring to find ways and means to improve living conditions for the Haitian people  has asked for bilateral and multilateral assistance and especially assistance from the United Nations to help the Provisional Electoral Council  the constitutional body entrusted with the task of organizing independent elections  fully to carry out its mandate.In this regard the Haitian people and their Government would be grateful to all friendly countries from all continents  and in particular to the fraternal countries of the Caribbean Community (CASICOM) and Latin America for any spirit of solidarity they might show with regard to Haiti and any interest they might show in the success of the electoral process.The date for the elections has just been officially set for 16 December by the Provisional Electoral Council< Nothing can now stop the march towards democratic elections organized in the best climate of security which the armed forces of Haiti have committed themselves to guarantee. We express the hope that the United Nations  in turn  will respond favourably and on an urgent basis to the request made by the Government of Haiti for appropriate assistance. I should like to reiterate the appeal made by the Provisional President of the Republic to the entire international community that finally Haiti will not remain alone: that on 7 February 1991 a new  freely elected President might take office  thereby putting Haiti irreversibly among the growing community of democratic nations.At a time when a new chapter is opening in history  the current state of world offers us areas of sadness as well as areas of promise for the future picture shows the degree of urgency with which the international community must meet the challenges to peace and international security. No less important in gap that continues to grow between the rich and the poor: the progress achieved in East-West relations should not obscure this dangerous chasm.We welcome the fact that  increasingly  people are showing confidence in the United Nations in meeting the many challenges that await us at the dawning of the year 2000. Among these challenges we would mention the consolidation of peace  of democracy  the preservation of our threatened environment  the campaign against drug abuse  the constant promotion of human rights  and  above all  the emergence of humanity from a level of dire necessity to a level where no one will lack any necessity.The Republic of Haiti for its part is convinced that developing as we are in a global community  we have no recourse but to international solidarity with interdependence and an increased awareness of our common destiny if we are to meet these challenges."
"66",3105,"HUN",45,1990,"﻿May I first of all extend to Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta my congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly.I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome to our midst the representatives of Namibia and Liechtenstein as new Members of the United Nations.Hungary  for the first time in more than four decades  has a Government which is responsible to a freely and democratically elected Parliament. My first duty at this forum is to extend sincere thanks on behalf of our new Government and our people to the United Nations for the moral and political support it gave to the 1956 Hungarian revolution and national freedom fight and the period following its suppression.Gloria victia was the message the Organisation sent to the whole world. The reports of the Committee of the Five  led by Sir Leslie Munro  the self-sacrificing activity of Danish diplomat Bang-Jensen and consistent efforts to keep the Hungarian question on the agenda of the United Nations had filled the suppressed with gratefulness  among them the then 15-yoar-old student who is now standing before you representing the Republic of Hungary turned free. Although the Hungarian people never abandoned the ideals of those times  it was not untilrecently that history enabled us to accomplish the most important aim ofOctober 1956  the establishment of a free  independent and democratic Hungary.Through its endeavour to do justice to our people  the United Nations acted in accordance with its mandate under the Charter  as it did and continues to do in the case of a number of other small countries. Recognition of this is particularly timely in our contemporary world. The period since last year's session of the General Assembly has witnessed historic changes in Europe and also on other continents. The political ice-age came to an end and a new system of international relations has started to take shape.As a result of the turn of events in the countries of the East-Central European region  the bipolar system laid down after Yalta has collapsed. The peoples of Central Europe have finally got rid of the Stalinist Party-State dictatorship  so alien to the traditions of European development  and have set themselves the aim of establishing a form of State with the rule of law based on freedom  a market economy and the enjoyment of human rights. After the fall of communism a qualitatively new situation on the continent has emerged. The earlier artificial division of Europe on an ideological basis and the resulting bloc-type approach of political  military and economic confrontation have been replaced by the historic opportunity to create a united Europe based on common values.The transformations taking place in the Soviet Union have been greatly instrumental in bringing about these changes in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Our eastern neighbour made a decisive contribution in 1945 to the liberation of our land from foreign occupation and from a puppet regime subservient to it. But that promise of freedom soon turned into a system that acquired Orwellian characteristics. It was not until recently that the Soviet leadership became a reliable partner in our own quest genuinely to set the Hungarian people free and do away with any foreign military presence  so that our nation can  at last  exercise fully its right to self-determination. The profound changes in Hungary have not only been an organic part of this process  but - and we are proud of this - also a catalyst for it. A significant role was played by the fact that respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms has been a key element in the process of renewal in Hungary. The results of the free and democratic parliamentary and Municipal all actions in Hungary this year mean a complete transformation of the entire political and social system. The new Hungary and its coalition Government are committed to democracy  political  economic and cultural pluralism and the rule of law in accordance with European standards. Consistent representation  protection and effective realisation of national interests are priorities in Hungarian foreign policy. The era of one-sided foreign-policy dependence has been replaced by a desire to build balanced relations. This implies a change in orientation  aimed at restoration of the ties that for 1 000 years linked Hungary to Europe but were severed four decades ago and at making Hungary once again an equal and respected member of the community of European nations. The Republic of Hungary shares European values and the idea of Atlantic partnership. Our country participates in the efforts to promote the processes of European integration and is committed to making an active contribution to the realisation of European unity.A most important condition for Hungary's integration into Europe lies in its becoming a full-fledged member of the European Community before the end of this decade. This means  on the one hand  that we should strive to conclude an association agreement with the Community by 1 January 1992 and  on the other hand  that we should create institutional machinery for political co-operation  alongside ongoing commercial and economic collaboration.Another important aspect of our intention to join Europe is Hungary's membership in the Council of Europe. We are convinced that the pluralist parliamentary democracy that emerged in the wake of free elections and the new system of self-government  as well as legislative and law-enforcement activity aimed at the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  will enable Hungary to meet fully the strict requirements of membership of the Council of Europe and will make possible its formal admission to that important organisation in the near future.Development of relations with neighbouring countries is obviously an important objective of our foreign policy. Clearly  under the new set of conditions  this is a historic opportunity to make full use of the potential  stemming from 1 000 years of coexistence  for co-operation based on democratic principles  mutual benefit  shared interests and values  and full awareness of a common destiny. In the view of the Hungarian Government  the corner-stone of democracy and the rule of law in our region - the eastern half of Europe - is represented not only by multi-party elections  but also  as an indispensable element of European stability  by tolerance recognition of the right to an autonomous life  and guaranteed preservation of the identities and specificities of the different national  ethnic  religious and linguistic minorities  as well as respect for their individual and collective rights· In this context  we firmly believe that guaranteeing human and minority rights for the more than 3 million ethnic Hungarians living in countries bordering on Hungary is a fundamental condition for the development of harmonious inter-State relations in Europe.	We believe that a significant contribution to the development of good-neighbourly relations and to the unification of Europe can be made by means of institutionalised regional co-operation  such as occurs within the Pentagonale that has been established between Austria  Czechoslovakia  Italy  Yugoslavia and Hungary.The bipolar world that characterized the period following the creation of the United Nations is increasingly being replaced by multipolarity. Hungary welcomes and supports this change. The institutional system of multilateralism is of great importance to us in this context. In our world of interdependence and increasing integration we lend active support to the United Nations - the most comprehensive organization of our time. In addition  we support all forms of regional co-operation  including the process of European security and co-operation  which concerns us most directly.So far as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) is concerned  we believe that a qualitatively new situation has been created by the changes that have taken place in Europe. The States participating in the Helsinki process -· among them  Hungary - have committed themselves to common values. Consequently  the security system built on bloc confrontation is becoming anachronistic  and the participating States have already begun to set up a new system of security based on principles of co-operation with the aim of establishing a united Europe.The Republic of Hungary believes that its security can best be strengthened by the establishment of precisely such a co-operative security system  which will embrace all CSC& States and will be in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In this context  and in pursuance of our efforts to end the outdated bloc approach  we have revised our relationship with the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The starting-point of our position on the issue is that from the very moment it was set up  the Warsaw Treaty  which was established - and was imposed upon us - 35 years ago  failed to serve the national and security interests of Hungary. It is the firm and declared intention of the Government of the new Hungary to leave the military organization of the Warsaw Treaty soon. Inevitably that will be followed by our complete departure from the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The Republic of Hungary wishes  in that way  to make an effective and lasting contribution to the affirmation of its independence and sovereignty and of its commitment to democracy  to the reassertion of its European identity  and to the elimination of the bloc concept from world politics.The Hungarian Government looks forward with great expectation to the CSCE summit meeting to be held at Paris this November. We are confident that  building upon the outstanding results achieved within the framework of the Helsinki process  the summit on the Seine will close the era of the cold war definitively and will herald the programme for a peaceful  democratic  united and prosperous Europe  free in every part of the continent. On this historic day  the reunification of Germany is a contribution to the attainment of that goal. After more than 40 years of partition  there is again a united homeland for the German people  where they may decide freely their own future. Hungary warmly welcomes the birth of a united Germany  established in accordance with the wish of the German people.Looking beyond Europe  we may safely say that the basically favourable development of the international situation facilitates efforts to solve the continuing regional crises or  at least  to ease tensions.A sad exception is the Middle East  where a grave new problem has been added to the existing ones. My Government has resolutely condemned Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and demands the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty. At the end of the twentieth century the argument that history explains actions such as those that we are witnessing in the Gulf area can in no way justify aggressive behaviour by any State. It is unacceptable short-sightedness  fraught with grave consequences  to allow any member of the international community to act in such a way. The world must not stand idly by. It must not tolerate brutality and violence that wipes a United Nations Member State off the map. We therefore support fully Security Council resolutions aimed at ending the aggression and eliminating its consequences  and we are ready to take an active part in the implementation of those resolutions  no matter what demands that may put on our economy. Nor does the recent case of the use of force improve the climate for the resolution of the long-drawn-out Arab-Israeli conflict  which has already taken an unbearable toll in human lives and suffering among the peoples of the region  Arabs and Jews alike. It is therefore high time to go beyond hostile attitudes and seek a peaceful solution by way of negotiation. This  naturally  requires the parties to respect the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and each other's legitimate interests  namely the right of Israel to live in peace within recognized borders on the one hand  and the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people on the other.In addition to the parties directly concerned in this conflict  we  the representatives of Member States  can also help remove the factors impeding mutual understanding. In our view  one such factor is General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX) of 1975 equating Zionism with racism. My Government deems this resolution to be a product of the bygone age of confrontation and dissociates itself from it. We believe that getting rid of the ideological shackles of the past may generate favourable processes  not only in Europe  but in other parts of the world as wall.An example of this is provided by what has taken place in the southern part of Africa  where the recent past has witnessed basically positive changes. Namibia's independence  and the fact that the dismantling of the apartheid system has begun in South Africa  are of paramount importance in this context. We are of the view that the favourable changes there should be reflected in our debates here- as well as in our adoption of a new approach to the issue. While invariably condemning all forms of discrimination  especially racial discrimination  including the system of apartheid  we  for our part  are exploring possibilities that encourage the forces in the Republic of South Africa working for the elimination of such phenomena. The exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms  which represent universal values  plays a major role. In order for them to be fully respected  the States Members of the United Nations have assumed unequivocal and detailed obligations which serve to ensure the application of civilised norms. It is the duty and the responsibility of us all to keep on monitoring compliance with these norms while at the same time being accountable to the international community.In our age  the power of human rights has become global and cannot serve any particular interests. The idea of free individuals in a free world transcends State frontiers and fulfils a mission which will ultimately lead us to a world without borders. Fortunately  the history of the recent past has given us several striking examples that confirm us in the belief that not even barbed wire  walls  foreign occupation  xenophobia  discriminatory policies or the shadow - or even the use - of bayonets are capable of really preventing the advocates of human rights from pursuing their mission and attaining the loftiest goals.For the Republic of Hungary  human rights and fundamental freedoms are basic values of democracy. In this connection  we highly appreciate the activities of the United Nations in promoting the international protection of these rights. We  for our part  are ready and willing to contribute our share to effective international action against violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We shall not hesitate to come out most resolutely against such violations  wherever they may occur.The Government of the Republic of Hungary devotes particular attention to the international protection of minority rights. Therefore  we welcome the growing awareness that the rights of national  ethnic  religious and linguistic minorities form an integral part of universally recognised human rights. The international community has both the right and the obligation to follow with constant attention the situation of minorities  to prevent potential conflicts  and in the case of violation of their rights  to restore legal protection and establish the responsibility of the party concerned.In this contest  Hungary attaches paramount importance to the effective protection of the rights of national minorities and to the establishment of an international mechanism for the protection of minorities. We have two reasons for this: our respect for the rule of law in internal and international behaviour  on the one hand  and  on the other  our responsibility  in accordance with international law  for the Hungarians who live beyond our borders as minorities.The heavy storms of history in the twentieth century  which were not merciful to small nations  and the decisions serving the interests of other Powers  forced millions of Hungarians to live beyond their frontiers in minority status. Hungarians living in neighbouring countries have become the largest minority in Europe. Their fate cannot be a matter of indifference to us  just as we cannot remain indifferent to the fate of minorities living anywhere else in the world. Within this contest  Hungary seeks - through legislative and other action - to ensure the full enjoyment of minority rights by those national minorities who live in our country. We are convinced that the international forums  the most important of which is the United Nations  have an indispensable role to play in the protection and enforcement of human and minority rights alike  and here I should like to add that  in my opinion  the changes in Central and Eastern Europe have decisively contributed to the possibility of finding a solution to these problems  and to this end I welcome the policies of the new democracies in the region. In keeping with the requirements of our times  Hungary considers it a highly important and urgent task to initiate the preparation of a binding instrument on the universal protection of the rights of minorities. The early finalisation of a draft declaration on the rights of national  ethnic  religious and linguistic minorities in the Commission on Human Rights would be a major step in this direction. The drawing up of an appropriate set of guarantees and the setting up of a control mechanism should also form part of an international codification  and we are prepared to play an active pioneering role in the accomplishment of this task as soon as possible.The issue of refugees is inseparable from that of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The waves of refugees are а dramatic and tragic phenomenon of our present-day world. Among its root causes a major one is the lack of guarantees for human rights. Hungary is facing this serious problem for the third consecutive year as it has received over 40 000 refugees in the recent past. The fact that most refugees come from among Hungarian minorities is deplorable. In the Hungarian Government's view it is the inalienable right of all individuals and peoples and ethnic groups to live in their native land  where their human rights  including the right to life and liberty  the right to leave their country and the right to return  should be fully respected. We consider it a task of the international community to promote the voluntary repatriation of refugees to their countries of origin. In this connection my delegation suggests that  in co-operation with the United Nations and the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees  an international agreement be elaborated aimed at facilitating the voluntary repatriation of refugees.As a result of the new era that has recently begun in international relations the possibility of building a multipolar world on a democratic basis is within our reach. Ideological confrontation has been replaced by a desire for mutually beneficial co-operation. All this affords a unique opportunity for the United Nations to live up fully to the lofty purposes and principles that were enshrined in its Charter 45 years ago.The strengthening of multilateralism and the recent achievements of the world Organization have greatly enhanced the role and prestige of the United Nations. We particularly appreciate its efforts at conflict resolution and its peace-keeping activities  to which we have given our support through our participation. The new era of international relations will make it possible for the world body to focus on the real global  social and economic issues that are crucial to the future of mankind.In speaking highly of the achievements of the United Nations we wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  whom we had the honour of welcoming in Budapest last May. Hungary has a primary interest in seeing the role of the United Nations enhanced and its activity become more effective. My Government will continue to work towards that end. Accordingly  we are committed to the principle of the universality of the United Nations  and we believe that neither political or ideological reasons nor references to the division of countries may serve to keep away from us those States that otherwise fulfil the requirements of United Nations membership.At this forum I should like to reaffirm the commitment of the Government of the Republic of Hungary to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. The foreign policy of the independent and democratic Hungarian Government will continue to remain consistent and predictable and open to co-operation with all our partners throughout the world."
"67",3152,"IDN",45,1990,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to offer you the felicitations of my delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your unanimous election is a well-deserved recognition of your many accomplishments in the service of your Government and of the international community. I am confident that under your stewardship  we will make substantive progress in our work.I should like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba  for the exemplary manner in which he guided our deliberations during a very busy year – chairing the forty-fourth session; the sixteenth special session  on apartheid; the seventeenth special session  on illicit narcotic drugs; and the eighteenth special session  devoted to international economic co-operation. His decisive and enlightened leadership has gained him the admiration of the entire Assembly. On behalf of the Government and the people of Indonesia  I extend a warm welcome to Liechtenstein upon its accession to membership of the United Nations. My delegation looks forward to close co-operation between our two countries.We live at a time of extraordinary flux  a time of great promise as well as grave challenge  a time of opportunity amidst pervasive uncertainty – in short  a time of profound contrasts and contradictions. On the bright side of the spectrum  rapid and fundamental change continues to transform the global political and economic landscape  ushering in a refreshingly new phase in international relations. The trend towards conciliation and concordance among nations  especially among the major Powers  gathered further momentum during the past year. We are heartened by the new spirit of co-operation among the permanent members of the Security Council in concerting their endeavours towards the peaceful resolution of conflict situations. On the continent of Europe the political  the economic and even the physical barriers are coming down and the East-West divide is progressively losing its ideological connotation. The imminent unification of the two German States signifies both the symbolic and the actual end of an era in European history. In Africa we have welcomed with deep satisfaction Namibia’s accession to independence and have noted the salutary effect this landmark event has had on developments in South Africa  where the Pretoria regime appears to be moving with greater seriousness to meet the legitimate aspirations of the majority of its people. Encouraging progress is also being made in resolving the question of Western Sahara. In Central America  the processes of national and regional reconciliation have moved forward opening the way towards greater harmony and common progress in that strife-torn region. In Asia the past year also witnessed yet another instance of erstwhile divided States drawing together when the two Yemens decided to merge into the new Republic of Yemen. My delegation congratulates the Government and the people of fraternal Yemen on their historic union. Indonesia has equally welcomed the initiation of high-level talks between the two Koreas at Prime Ministerial level  in the hope that it may foster an atmosphere conducive to the realization of  their shared aspirations for peaceful reunification. In South-East Asia there is renewed hope that  with the recent breakthroughs in the ongoing negotiating process  a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict may now be within our grasp. On the global plane the easing of East-West tensions and of ideological contention and competition has opened up new possibilities for substantial progress in disarmament and arms reductions. At the same time  some seminal trends are making their impact felt in the economic sphere  offering enhanced opportunities as well as challenges to our question for an international economic order of greater equity and generalized prosperity. While these developments indeed bolster our hopes for the attainment of a more peaceful  secure just and tolerant world  we cannot but be acutely aware also of the darker side of this picture. Despite the palpable improvements in the global political climate  despite the emergence of new and more enlightened perspectives on the solution of old and new problems  the international scene today is still beset by unresolved tensions and conflicts  by rampant violence and widespread instability. Deeply rooted inequalities and imbalances continue to afflict inter-State relations  especially between developed and developing countries  where North-South polarization is becoming accentuated as the major issue of our time. The politics of power  political domination and economic coercion still feature all too prominently in present-day international relations  and the remaining vestiges of colonialism and institutionalized racism have yet to be erased from our vision of universal emancipation. Against this backdrop it is deeply disturbing to note that States continue to resort to armed force and military intervention in the settlement of disputes  thus gravely threatening regional peace and global security and undermining all impulses and efforts to shape a world of greater harmony and mutual tolerance. It is in this context that Indonesia has viewed with growing alarm and deep distress the recent events in the Gulf region. As a United Nations Member committed to uphold the sanctity of the Charter and as a country which unswervingly adheres to the 10 principles of Bandung and those of the Non-Aligned Movement  Indonesia has always firmly opposed foreign intervention  aggression and the use or threat of force in inter-State relations. Hence  Iraq’s invasion and declared annexation of Kuwait cannot be condoned  and my Government fully supports and abides by all the Security Council resolutions adopted in that respect.It is particularly saddening to us that the present conflict involves two fellow members of the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  with which Indonesia has long maintained close  brotherly relations. It is  moreover  profoundly regrettable that  as a result of these developments  efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement of the wider problems of the region causes by Israel’s aggression and continued illegal occupation of Arab lands and persistent denial of the inalienable national and human rights of the Palestinian people appear to have been eclipsed. We therefor concur with the Secretary-General that  once we succeed in putting the present crisis on the road to resolution  the longer-term  underlying problems of the region must be addressed. Towards this end  solutions cannot and should not be sought through military means or by unilateral action. Only a political settlement under the auspices of the United Nations or within the framework of Arab mediation  can avoid further aggravation and enlargement of the present conflict. Meanwhile  Indonesia calls upon all countries involved to exercise self-restraint and to refrain from actions that would only exacerbate a situation already close to boiling point. Other focal points of tension and conflict persist in many parts of the globe  notably on the continents of Asia  Africa and Latin America. Although they are now being addressed with greater vigour and more receptivity towards dialogue and negotiation  the pace of progress in their comprehensive resolution unfortunately remains excruciatingly slow. Armed strife in Afghanistan continues  with no clear prospect of a political settlement yet in sight. Likewise  on the question of Cyprus it is regrettable that no advance could be made towards an overall agreement despite the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General. In the context of Iran-Iraq relations  welcome progress has recently been made in the implementation of some key aspects of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  involving troop withdrawals and the repatriation of prisoners of war. We fervently hope that all the other elements of the resolution can now be fulfilled  thus leading to a just and durable peace. Namibia’s accession to independence represents not only the culmination of the heroic struggle of the Namibian people against colonial domination and racist oppression but also a clear vindication of the role of the United Nations as the unique multilateral forum to bring freedom and justice to oppressed people everywhere. But the total liberation of Africa will remain unfulfilled until the universally condemned system of apartheid in South Africa has been dismantled and replaced by a non-racial democratic government based on majority rule. Indonesia welcomed the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress (ANC)  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political parties and organization and we rejoiced at the release of Nelson Mandela. We note  however  that the basic structures of the apartheid system still remain in place. We therefore shall continue to demand that the Pretoria regime take the more fundamental steps of revoking the bulk of its repressive security legislation  freeing all political prisoners and engaging in a genuine negotiating process with the authentic leaders of the South African people. Meanwhile  sanctions must be maintained until the process of fundamental transformation – not more cosmetic reform – has become irreversible. Indonesia is gravely concerned that at a time when rapprochement and conciliation between erstwhile adversaries prevail in many regions of the world  the Middle East remains the vortex of violence and explosive tensions. Efforts at resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict  with the Palestinian people’s struggle for justice and freedom at its core  continue to stagnate. The peace process remains blocked by   Israel’s intransigent refusal to reciprocate the courageous peace initiatives by the Palestinian leadership and to adopt a rational negotiating position capable of advancing that process. On the contrary  it has persisted in its policies and practices of brutal repression against the Palestinian people and in its universally censured settlement schemes in the occupied territories. The situation has been further aggravated by Israel’s most recent attempts at forcefully changing the demographic equation by allowing the influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants to settle in the West Bank and Gaza in blatant violations of international law. If not stopped  this unacceptable development will have far-reaching and disastrous effects on the problem as well as on the peace process itself. In these circumstances and with the heightened tensions engendered by the present crisis in the Gulf  it is now more urgent than ever to press for an equitably conceived and comprehensively negotiated political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its complexity and dimensions. The International Peace Conference under the auspices of the United Nations remains  in Indonesia’s view  the most effective framework for negotiations on all the essential elements of a just solution. The alternative can only be mounting frustration and despair and an inexorable drift towards further violence. In South-East Asia  the situation in Cambodia remains a major focus of concern to Indonesia and to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Over the past year  continuing efforts have been expanded in the long and arduous search for a just  comprehensive and durable settlement of the conflict. A number of meetings have taken place and valuable contributions have been made by many sides  which have all combined steadily to push the peace process forward. Particularly noteworthy in this regard has been the agreement reached by the five permanent members of the Security Council at their recent meeting in New York on a framework and on key elements of a comprehensive political settlement based on an enhanced role of the United Nations. Prior to this  some basic understandings were also reached among the Cambodian parties and regional countries in meetings held in Jakarta  Bangkok  Tokyo and elsewhere. Most recently  a significant breakthrough was achieved at a meeting in Jakarta earlier this month  convened by France and Indonesia as co-Chairmen of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia (PICC) and attended by the four Cambodian parties as well as by the representatives of the United Nations Secretary-General. At this meeting the Cambodian parties agreed to accept the framework document formulated by the five permanent members of the Security Council in its entirety as the basis for settling the Cambodian conflict  and they committed themselves to co-operation with all the other participants of the PICC to elaborate this framework into a comprehensive political settlement through the processes of the PICC. They also agreed to form a Supreme National Council as the unique legitimate body and source of authority in which  throughout the transitional period  the independence  sovereignty and unity of Cambodia would be embodied. The Supreme National Council will henceforth represent Cambodia externally and occupy the seat of Cambodia at the United Nations and all its specialized agencies and in other international institutions and international conferences. The achievement of those two agreements  taken together  indeed represents a major step forward  imparting a decisive impetus to the negotiating process. With the ground thus prepared for the early reconvening of the Paris Conference  it is our fervent hope that all parties to the conflict and other concerned countries will now marshal the required political determination to pursue the process and to elaborate and conclude a comprehensive political settlement. That path ahead may still be rocky  but I am confident that we have now come to the final stretch on the road to a just and enduring peace in Cambodia and an end to the immense suffering of its people. The cold war has ended. But as we assess its implications let us not entertain the rather simplistic notion that it has resulted in the victory of one side and the defeat of the other. I would like to believe that rationality and a growing awareness of the need for common security have won over the military and political doctrines which for so long have threatened to lead the world to the bring of collective self-destruction.The current international scene impresses on us the sobering reality of how little progress has been made in disarmament and how marginally we have moved in stemming the arms race. A more effective strategy is therefor needed to reverse the arms race and to accelerate the process of arms reduction and disarmament  especially in the nuclear field. In the context of START  the prospects for concrete agreements are within reach and we urge their rapid adoption. Further negotiations should seek even deeper reductions in nuclear forces and limitations on qualitative improvements. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty should continue to be accorded high priority and  as such  should be clearly reflected in the forthcoming amendment conference on the partial test-ban Treaty. It is a source of great disappointment for Indonesia that the recently held Fourth Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty did not succeed in articulating a consensus concerning the cessation of the nuclear arms race. The failure to achieve a final declaration is all the more regrettable against the background of the present improved global situation. It is our fervent hope that the attitudes demonstrated by the major nuclear Powers during the Review Conference will not be reintroduced at the forthcoming conference to amend the partial test-ban Treaty  as this would only serve to confirm the untenable position that the complete cessation of nuclear testing can only be negotiated bilaterally between the two super-Powers. As regards regional disarmament  my delegation believes that efforts to expedite the realization of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia  and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia as its integral component  should become increasingly relevant. Purposeful progress in this regard would constitute a concrete contribution by the regional States to the establishment of greater peace and stability in their part of the world. Rapid change and transition  the distinctive hallmarks of the global political situation  are of equal pertinence to the economic and social sphere. Lasting peace cannot be sustained in isolation from socio-economic progress. Both are inextricably linked. As in increasingly being recognized  peace needs to be securely anchored in the solid bedrock of economic development and social justice worldwide. The decade of the 1990s has ushered in a remarkable and promising new era. With the end of the cold war and the amelioration in East-West relations  vast new opportunities for economic development have opened up. At the same time  the world economy and international economic relations are moving towards ever greater interdependence and integration. The globalization of economic activities  the emergence of new and powerful economic centres  and major shifts in comparative advantage  have drastically altered the patterns of production  consumption and trade. In addition  innovations in science and technology  and the revolution in communications  have also resulted in enlarged possibilities for the common progress of nations and peoples. Yet  it is also true that given the asymmetries in present-day international economic relations  some of these trends could present major challenges and constraints to the developing countries. The past year has witnessed the dramatic transformation of the Eastern European centrally planned economies  leading to their progressive integration into the world economic system. Indonesia welcomes this development  for its own sake and for the prospects it offers of new opportunities  such as expanded markets for exports from developing countries. Nevertheless  there is also genuine and justified concern that financial  trade and investment flows of considerable magnitude from the developed North might now be rechanneled to Eastern Europe. In addition  we are carefully assessing the possible impact of the formation of powerful economic groupings among developed countries  as exemplified by the prospective single European marker and the United States-Canadian Free Trade Agreement. Certainly  such regional economic integration could be a major stimulus to the global economy  provided however that it remains outward-looking and does not result in additional external barriers. In light of these circumstances  we are gratified with the consensus outcome of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly on international economy co-operation. Its Declaration provides the international community with a coherent blueprint for overcoming the crippling legacies of the past and meeting the challenges of the 1990s. At the same time  we are fully aware that if the provisions of the Declaration are not translated into concrete measures  the acclaimed spirit  aspirations and homes generated at the special session may prove illusory. What is needed is to build upon this important first step and to ensure the success of our collective endeavours in those undertakings  as already set out on the international agenda. Of great importance on this agenda is the International Development Strategy for the 1990s. The proposed strategy  as discussed at the recently concluded fourth session of the Ad Hoc Preparatory Committee  is an ambiguous yet realistic undertaking. It should promote the achievement of its principal aim  namely  that of accelerating the development of the developing countries. In this connection  we certainly appreciate the emphasis being placed on new issues of common concern  including environmental protection  human development and the alleviation of poverty. At the same time  it is important to make sure that our preoccupation with these concerns does not obscure the urgent need to address and resolve the perennial problems confronting the developing countries  especially the interrelated issues of money  finance  debt  trade and commodities. The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations  now in its final and critical stage  is another even of the utmost importance on the international agenda. Let us be clear that the ultimate objective of the Round is to strengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its rules  so as to ensure an open and fair international trading system. It should not therefor be construed as legitimizing the vested interests of the strong. In this context  it is vital that these negotiations should lead to an equitable and balanced outcome  taking fully into account the specific concerns and needs of the developing countries. This should in essence mean creating an international trading environment that will permit the developing countries effectively to pursue their development process  while benefiting from their comparative advantage in the production  processing and export of their commodities and manufactures. Beyond the Uruguay Round  the eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VIII) in 1991 should provide us with an excellent opportunity to address international co-operation in trade and development  such as the revitalization of international commodity co-operation and other trade related development issues. As the Secretary-General mentioned in his report on the work of the Organisation  the foremost problem in the context of renewing the process of growth and development requiring an adequate international response is that of external indebtedness. In this regard  we are encouraged by the appointment of Mr. Bettino Craxi as the Secretary-General’s Personal Representative on debt. We sincerely hope that his findings and recommendations will contribute to our collective search for more innovative  comprehensive and effective responses to the external debt problems of all categories of debtor developing nations. As a country acutely conscious of the vulnerability of the world’s ecosystem and of the resultant threats to future development that its destruction may cause  Indonesia attaches particular importance to the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992. The world’s blemished environment obviously calls out for redress. The responsibility for this undertaking should be equitably shared amongst all nations  taking fully into account the existing disparities between developed and developing countries. More specifically  the developing countries should not be penalized for the development excesses of the industrialised countries. Rather  the linkages between environmental concerns and the legitimate development needs of developing countries should be fully recognized. It is out sincere hope that the preparatory process for the Conference recently launched in Nairobi will succeed in forging consensus on an effective programme of action to address this major concern of humanity. The importance increasingly attached by the international community to human development is further reinforced by the Human Development Report 1990 recently released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This report reflects the growing recognition of the human factor as central to the success of development policies and the alleviation of mass poverty.  In addition  it spells out strategies for human development as measured by the human development index. We welcome this additional dimension as a means for complementing  rather than replacing  the traditional parameters of development. At the regional level  the Jakarta Plan of Action  adopted by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) more than two years ago  was specifically designed to enhance the human dimension of development. Now already in its operational phase  the Plan of Action is demonstrating its great significance to the development processes in the region. The common aspiration of mankind to decent living conditions  adequate shelter  respect for fundamental human rights and the health and well-being of our children is moving to the forefront of international consciousness and is reshaping the international agenda. The forthcoming World Summit for Children is a manifestation of this shift in priorities and will be a significant occasion for focusing the attention of the international community on the plight of its most vulnerable members. Although only a beginning  the goals of the Summit with respect to child survival  protection and development must be given full force. It is surely within our collective capacity to do so. In that connection  the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by the requisite number of Member States and has entered into force. Indonesia  having signed the Convention earlier this year  has now completed the ratification with the United Nations. Having assumed the legal as well as the moral obligations of the Convention  we shall work diligently to fulfill this commitment and shall continue to enhance and protect the lives of children.In other areas as well our common resolve must continue to be strengthened. Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and the dilemma of drug abuse continue to take a prominent place on our agenda. The seventeenth special session of the General Assembly  on international co-operation against the illicit production  supply  demand  trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  testified to that. The Political Declaration and the Global Programme of Action adopted at that session strengthened the inventory at our disposal to counter this threat to society and again signaled our collective commitment to effective action and the unity of purpose. Significantly  the need to address issues of both supply and demand has been reconfirmed  along with the underlying social causes that generate the use of narcotics. Indonesia remains fully committed to the international campaign against illicit trafficking and drug abuse  and pledges its best efforts to contribute to its success. The assault on society by those who traffic in and abuse illicit narcotics must be turned back. The death of 25 000 young people each day from preventable causes can no longer be tolerated. Yet these issues cannot be divorced from the questions of overall development. Indeed  the new international agenda must be shaped with the broad context of socio-economic development  guided by a moral conscience. The fundamental human rights of all people and the equal treatment of women and their inclusion as equal partners in the development process must be ensured. Poverty and despair must be overcome. Education must be enhanced. In sum  the overall quality of life for all people  and particularly for our children  must be improved so that we may build a better future for all mankind.  As we enter the last decade of the century we are again being presented with a unique opportunity to construct a radically new  more peaceful  just and prosperous global order. This opportunity should not be missed. Yet if the pursuit of that objective is to achieve tangible reality  a renewal of confidence in multilateralism and a recognition of the irreplaceable value and role of the United Nations are imperative. In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General advanced a number of proposals to strengthen further the functioning of the United Nations. We believe that in view of the Organization’s steadily expanding role in peace-keeping and peace-making  the search for ways and means to ensure broader and more stable support for such activities has indeed become essential. The need is now also being felt for periodic meetings of the Security Council at a high political level to survey world political developments and to identify potential conflict and crisis situations  thereby enhancing the Council’s capacity for preventive diplomacy. Such meetings should be supported by an improvement in the Secretary-General’s capacity for timely and unbiased information gathering. At the same time  the central functions of the Economic and Social Council in policy guidance and monitoring and co-ordinating system-wide action in the economic  social and humanitarian fields should be equally strengthened. But we should always bear in mind that all efforts to strengthen the role  improve the functioning and increase the efficiency and efficacy of the United Nations will remain inadequate unless they are matched by the consistent support  including financial support  of all Member States. I wish also to underscore the Secretary-General’s observation that the Organisation will be in danger of being bypassed and sidelined if Member States  especially the major Powers  choose to act outside the ambit of the purposes and principles of the Charter. We fully agree with him that“It is the willing endorsement of the decisions of the Security Council by the international community that can best counter any impression…. or world affairs being run by a directorate”.The world is at a crossroads. The forces of change are relentlessly pushing it into uncharted waters. While opportunities abound  so too do uncertainties and dangers. To meet these unprecedented challenges effectively  multilateral co-operation and genuine interdependence are critically importance. Nor is it a viable alternative to advance the interests of any State or region at the expense of others. It is only though shared responsibility and a shared commitment to global co-operation and solidarity that we can hope to manage the massive changes that are transforming the shape and substance of international relations for the decades ahead."
"68",3199,"IND",45,1990,"﻿It is with a deep sense of history that I address the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session  the first since the end of the cold war.The confidence we repose in Mr. Guido de Marco provides us with the assurance that this session  under his stewardship  will reach decisions that will strengthen global peace and co-operation and enhance global well-being. At the very outset let me say how happy I am that the Foreign Minister of the friendly  non-aligned State of Malta is presiding over this session.I must also record our appreciation for the leadership displayed by Major-General Joseph Garba in presiding over the forty-fourth session.I also join other Members of the United Nations in welcoming in our midst the newest Member of the United Nations  Liechtenstein. It gives us special joy also to see a united Yemen in our midst.Forty-five years ago India was one of the relatively small number of States that were present at the creation of the United Nations. The United Nations was born of a war-shattered world's hope that it would be the benign  sometimes stern guardian of a world at peace  committed to peace and co-operation between nations. Unfortunately  the end of the Second World War did not bring peace; it brought a long  often icy  cold war. Scores of new nations in Asia and Africa emerged as sovereign States from the crumbling empires of Europe. The cold war had a negative impact on the life of those new nations. We in the so-called third world remained firmly committed to the United Nations as the only organisation that could usher in a truly world-wide peace and promote global well-being. The vicissitudes through which the United Nations passed did not diminish our faith in the Organisation.We  the nations of the South  have special reason to rejoice at the end of the cold war. India is all the happier because from the very moment of its independence it sought to end the cold war. We joined other nations to enunciate the principles of non-alignment to protect the independence of new nations and their right to choose for themselves the kind of international relations they wished to have and the models of development they wished to adopt. We welcome the collapse of the cold-war divide. I trust that the cold-war mind frame which took deep root during the past 45 years will now yield to the new mind frame of global detente and co-operation.An event of special importance in this context is the imminent unification of Germany. This will reflect the fulfilment of the deepest aspirations of the German people. In the new Europe which is emerging a united Germany in the model foreseen by a great son of Germany  Thomas Mann  will be a powerful factor in favour of stability and peaceful co-operation. India looks forward to working closely with a united Germany in the cause of peace and progress around the world. India always rejected the logic of the cold war and the division of the international community into opposing blocs. In accordance with our policy of non-alignment we sought to build up relations of trust and friendship simultaneously with both the Soviet Union and the United States. The replacement of East-West confrontation by a new co-operative approach has greatly facilitated our task. The past year has seen a further strengthening of our ties with the great democracy of the United States. With our time-tested friend  the Soviet Union  we are adding new dimensions to our friendly co-operation. We hail the historic endeavours of the Soviet people to reshape their political and economic structures on the basis of democracy  unity and economic efficiency.The United Nations was a participant in many of the momentous changes during the year. Its work in Namibia and Nicaragua provided splendid examples of its role  testifying to its renewed relevance and effectiveness in international affairs  λ great deal of the credit goes to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his patient  prudent  painstaking and imaginative management of the world body. We wish him and his colleagues continued success in their undertakings.The Secretary-General perceptively observes in his report on the work of the Organisation this year: ""It has been a wholesome development of recent years that the international discourse has been disburdened of excessive ideological or rhetorical baggage. It is far easier to accommodate contentious interests or claims  honestly stated  than to reconcile opposing doctrines. If the new mood of pragmatism which has released us from the thraldom of the cold war is to spread all over the world  nations need to shed the vestigial prejudices of former times and couch their dialogue in terms of common sense and plain justice. These are truly wise words spoken at a critical turn of history.India joins the many nations that now wish to see the United Nations emerge as the pivot and fulcrum of international peace and security. The new effectiveness of the United Rations owes a great deal to the fact that the earlier confrontational relationship between the great Powers gave way to detente  which in turn has led to a new collaborative relationship  λ co-operative relationship among the major Powers is α necessary  but not a sufficient  condition for true multilateralism. The latter requires the full and equal participation of all nations - big and small - in the multilateral decision-making process. The great issues of the day can no longer be decided in the capitals of a few major Powers. The voice of the majority must not only be heard but also be respected. The democratic principle is an essential requirement of a genuinely multilateral system. Nor can the concerns of the deprived majority of the world's population be denied priority on the international agenda. The new political prestige of the United Nations must be complemented by increased efficacy in other areas  particularly in the economic field. Peace and development are closely interrelated and deserve equal attention. In the final analysis  the success of the United Nations will be measured in terms of its ability to reflect and meet the concerns of the majority of mankind.India is gravely concerned at the crisis in the Gulf region. India's position was  and remains  clear and consistent  we are against the use or threat of force in the settlement of differences in inter-State relations. We firmly oppose aggression. The crisis has arisen from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It follows that Iraq must withdraw its forces from Kuwait as demanded by the Security Council. India does not recognise Kuwait's annexation. Kuwait's independence and sovereignty must be restored. Any differences between the two neighbouring States must be resolved exclusively through peaceful means. India fully subscribes to and strictly abide by all the resolutions of the Security Council concerning this crisis. At the same time we maintain that all efforts must be made to achieve a peaceful political resolution of the crisis.The current crisis has led to the induction of foreign forces into the Gulf region. In the changed world environment  a permanent foreign Military presence is not desires by any country  nor would it be in anyone's interest.For a very long time India has Maintained the Most cordial and friendly relations with Kuwait and Iraq. Almost 200 000 of our nationals who were present in these countries when the crisis erupted found themselves caught up in its coils. Provision of essential food supplies for the aid other innocent victims fro  third countries is a Matter of the highest importance from the humanitarian point of view  to the entire world community.In West Asia there can be no durable peace without a just and comprehensive settlement based on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  as well as the right of all States in the region  including Palestine and Israel  to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders  in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 336 (1973). Israel's attempts to suppress the intifadah or block progress towards a dialogue cannot succeed. A United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East should be convened at an early date.India reaffirms its solidarity with the people of Cyprus  part of whose country remains under foreign occupation. We fully support the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of that country. Obstacles have recently been thrown up in the way of the Secretary-General's efforts on Cyprus. The Secretary-General deserves the continuing and full support of the international community in his endeavours. Some of the most hopeful developments during the year relate to southern Africa. Earlier this year we warmly welcomed independent Namibia into this world body. Developments in South Africa hold out promise of real progress. Nelson Mandela  freed after a quarter of a century behind bars  galvanised the currents of peaceful change. We welcome the talks initiated between the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Government to clear the way for negotiations on a new non-racial constitution. We are concerned  however  at the continuing violence in the townships and the involvement of the South African security forces in the violence. The South African Government must urgently deal with the problem  in order to remove this threat to the process of peaceful change.While racism is on the retreat in South Africa  in Fiji a constitution has been imposed which institutionalises racial discrimination. The Suva regime flouts internationally accepted principles of democracy and human rights. Its undemocratic and racially discriminatory policies are unacceptable.In the Korean peninsula there have been some encouraging signs of reconciliation and dialogue. We regard the recent historic meetings between the Prime Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea as a major step forward. We hope that this process will be further strengthened in future months. We support all efforts aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea. In conformity with the principle of universality  we further support the aspirations of the Korean people to be represented in the United Nations so that they may actively contribute towards the realisation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. There has been encouraging progress towards a resolution of the Cambodian problem. The recent Jakarta meeting and the decision on the Supreme National Council hold out the promise of an early return to normalcy. A settlement of the problem should fully reflect Cambodia's sovereignty and independence and ensure that its people can exercise their democratic right to determine their own destiny free from foreign interference and intervention. In this process the United Nations can and should play an important role.Myanmar continues to hold in thrall by forces unwilling to accept the decision that its people took in the national elections held there in May of this year. We call upon Yangon to accept the people's verdict and work with the latter to establish peace and democracy in that country.Relations with our northern neighbour  the People's Republic of China  have shown a steady and welcome improvement. Both countries have expressed their determination to settle the boundary question through peaceful and friendly consultations and also to develop relations actively in a variety of other fields. In the world where confrontation is giving way to co-operation  friendly co-operation between India and China is all the more important.We have recently had the honour of receiving the President of Afghanistan in India. His presence in our midst reflected the common desire of both our countries to strengthen further the co-operative and friendly relations that have traditionally existed between them. We believe that full and faithful implementation of the Geneva Agreements so arduously constructed by the Secretary-General will restore normalcy  stabilize the life and security of the Afghan peoples and also help in furthering the cause of peace and good-neighbourliness in South Asia. We warmly welcome the return of democracy in our neighbouring country  Nepal. Differences that had earlier crept into our relations were happily and speedily resolved after the transition in Nepal  thus reflecting the deep aspirations of the two neighbours.	With the background of the improved inter-State relationships in South Asia  which have been universally welcomed  I would not have taken the time of this body to talk about the aberration pertaining to the bilateral relations between India and Pakistan. In his address my worthy colleague the Foreign Minister of Pakistan has tried to provoke me into an exchange of polemics on issues that are patently internal to India. May I say I will not oblige him.For more than 8 years now Pakistan has nursed and armed terroristic activities in the Indian State of Punjab. This has caused immense human suffering  Of late Pakistan has chosen to extend those practices to another State of India  Jammu and Kashmir  again resulting in extensive misery and loss of innocent lives. All efforts on our part to persuade the Government of Pakistan to desist from those activities were first ignored and then rejected. Characteristically  Pakistan denied responsibility and involvement in those acts. Now it is trying to justify them on the pretext of support to religious fundamentalism. This  representatives will agree  is against the established principles of international law and good-neighbourliness. The Indo-Pakistan Sheila Agreement signed in 1972 has fully spelled out those principles  and  despite Pakistan's blatant violation  India has continued its quest to build a wholesome relationship of cordiality and friendship that I know the people of our two countries need and desire.The arms race  support of terrorism and aggressive polemics only add to tensions and create a climate of instability so much out of place in the contemporary global environment. We have recently proposed to Pakistan a set of measures that would induce confidence and co-operation. But  I say with sadness  Pakistan has chosen to ignore them and to persist in its unacceptable activities. Our two neighbouring countries can have a great future if we respect each other's integrity and unity  and once Pakistan desists from the temptation of interfering in our internal affairs. It is in this spirit that I will not refer to the gross flouting of human rights in Pakistan  particularly in Sind and Baluchistan. To cover up those inhuman acts a duly elected Government has recently been dismissed. But that is Pakistan's internal matter  even though democrats everywhere feel concerned.We believe that regional organizations have acquired an added relevance and can play an important role in promoting international co-operation. In our region the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation is making a most valuable contribution by fostering a climate of constructive co-operation. We look forward to the steady expansion of its activities  and we do hope that in the coming days Afghanistan and a democratic Myanmar will join that organisation to build an era so much needed in our part of the world.The reordering of Eastern Europe is epoch making. India welcomes that reaffirmation of the democratic spirit. The changes in that region have understandably prompted the generous instincts of the industrialized world. We hope that Eastern Europe's integration into the world economy will serve the interests of all nations. We look forward to strengthening our ties of co-operation with those countries. At the same time we also expect that the East-West thaw will not result in depriving the developing world of augmented economic assistance.We have yet to harness effectively the extraordinary opportunities for the success of disarmament efforts created by the sweeping political changes in Europe and in East-West relations. We look forward to the conclusion of a START treaty and an agreement on conventional forces in Europe by the end of this year  as promised. However  those agreements would not justify complacency on the part of the United Nations or international public opinion  as huge arsenals still remain. There is no underlying commitment to give up the doctrine of nuclear deterrence  and avenues for qualitative upgrading of nuclear weapons remain open. Nothing less than a time-bound programme for the elimination of nuclear weapons would sustain a continuous process of deep and substantial reduction until we get rid of the nuclear menace. We also need clear guarantees that the nuclear weapons that are phased out will not be replaced by new  advanced weapons.With the end of the cold war we feel that now is the time - and a most opportune one - for the international community to question the validity of theories that seek to justify continuation of nuclear weapons. Inter-State relations should be based on co-operation and dialogue instead of mutual fears and frozen hostility. A new international security order needs to be created to prepare us to move towards a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world order outlined within a systematic  rational and practicable time-frame for achieving those objectives.The positive developments during the past three years since the United Nations Conference on Disarmament and Development have only further vindicated the essential premises of that Conference. Now is the time for seriously exploring the actual ways and means of channelling the peace dividend for the development of the countries of the South that have had to face the adverse economic consequences of the cost of the unprecedented arms build-up in the past decades. The linkage between disarmament and development should remain in the focus of deliberations during the current session. The immediate priorities during the coming year pertain to negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty  the speedy conclusion of a chemical-weapons convention and the launching of the second phase of reductions in strategic arms with the purpose of eliminating whole classes of those weapons. All nuclear-weapon States must be involved in the negotiations for nuclear disarmament and should be prepared to undertake obligations now. The international community should call upon the nuclear-weapon States to abjure the use of nuclear weapons through an international accord on the non-use of those weapons. Those measures  if they are set in motion  would reflect the far-reaching changes in international relations. Economic growth during the last year has shown a nixed record  the expansion of world trade and output has begun to slow down. External and fiscal imbalances between the major economies have continued  aggravating the uncertainties that face the developing countries. Monetary instability and higher interest rates have added to the formidable economic problems of those countries. The international economic environment has remained inhospitable  as protectionism and discriminatory trade practices  inadequate financial flows  low commodity prices and exclusion from international economic decision-making have conspired to make developing countries insecure and vulnerable.As I pointed out earlier  the Iraq-Kuwait crisis worsened this situation by raising oil prices  interrupting oil supplies and  in general  handicapping growth efforts.While new problems have arisen  long-standing ones  like external debt  continue to constrain development prospects. Some welcome initiatives have been taken  but they do not appear to be commensurate with the magnitude of the problem. Difficulties of many other countries have been overlooked so far - pointing to the inescapable need for a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem. Such a solution must include anticipatory measures to prevent further proliferation of the problem to countries that  despite serious difficulties  are continuing to service their debts.An international development strategy for the next decade is currently being formulated. This period will determine whether the world carries over into the twenty-first century the present legacy of poverty  underdevelopment and stagnation  or whether it embarks on a more productive era  aiming at qualitatively higher levels of human welfare  affording all countries and ell peoples an equitable opportunity to prosper in a stable and predictable external environment. This guiding principle of international co-operation should underlie our efforts in all the sectoral areas of strategy. I hope that we shall be able to conclude negotiations quickly  so that the international community may have before it a coherent and identifiable framework of goals and objectives and a consistent set of policy measures to which all countries stand committed.The North-South dialogue  once nurtured by the international community  has fallen into a state of neglect. It deserves to be revived. When political co-operation is on the upswing  why should economic co-operation languish? The head and the limbs have to function together if the body is to be strong. India has traditionally had the privilege  in this contest  of working with other countries to make a North-South compact real and forceful.South-South co-operation to build up collective self-reliance is an important aspect of international economic growth. The summit  in Kuala Lumpur in June this year  of 15 developing countries  including India  provided significant impetus to this process. Given the political will  much more is possible  and much more should be the aim.We are now less than 60 days away from the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. A great deal of expectation has been aroused in these negotiations. We have been participating in good faith  in the hope that the conclusions will assist in the development of the developing countries. Despite very severe economic difficulties  many developing countries  including India  have made offers to the limit of their capability. These offers are not  however  being reciprocated - particularly the ones in respect of areas to which developing countries attach importance  such as textiles  agriculture  tropical products and safeguards. It is difficult to visualise a balanced outcome from the Uruguay Round without substantial progress in these and other areas that are of greatest concern to developing countries. Environmental concerns have - rightly - moved to the top of the international agenda. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992  will be an event of great importance  focusing on the inescapable fact that protection of the environment requires acceleration of development in the poorer countries.At the heart of the environmental crisis lies the persistence of wide disparities  in levels of production and consumption  between the developed and the developing countries. The very high per capita consumption levels in the industrialized world impose a corresponding strain on global natural resources and thus on the environment. On the other hand  extreme poverty in the developing countries is itself a cause of environmental degradation. In order simply to survive  poverty-stricken people are forced  for example  to cut down forests for firewood or to overgraze pastures.In the developing countries the environment cannot be protected unless the root cause of its degradation - namely  poverty - is eradicated. Thus sustainable development calls for curbs on extravagant life-styles in affluent countries and for the promotion of economic development in less fortunate areas. 1 should like to add  as parenthesis  that the call for a change in life-styles in affluent societies does not imply a reduction in living standards - indeed  it envisages an improvement in the overall quality of life.It is now accepted that environmental protection requires the provision of new and additional funds for developing countries  as veil as the transfer of environmentally benign technology to these countries on a preferential basis. Any new environmental regulatory mechanisms should be accompanied  from the outset  by full and adequate provision for funding the technology transfer. This is an absolute requirement for effective action on the environment.In conclusion  I wish to say that the issues of today are of the utmost importance. We have left behind a long history and have crossed the threshold to another epoch. We have to put our heads and hearts together to design a world of peace and development. We have to fashion the United Nations to reflect the end of the cold war  making it responsive to the diversity of the world community  and representative of world democracy and the equality of sovereign nations. Let the new era usher in world peace and a global fabric of co-operation. Let us all work together towards that noble objective."
"69",3245,"IRL",45,1990,"﻿I should like at the outset to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly  and to your country  Malta. I know your wisdom and expertise will guide us in a most efficient manner through our work. Our thanks go to the outgoing President  Mr. Garba of Nigeria  who presided so ably over the forty-fourth session. I also wish to record our thanks to the Secretary-General for his continuing efforts for an enhanced role for the United Nations.The Foreign Minister of Italy  Mr. De Michelis  has already addressed the Assembly on behalf of the twelve member States of the European Community. My Government fully endorses the views contained in that statement  which are supported by all member States of the Community. The year that has elapsed since we last met here in the General Assembly has been a truly memorable one in international life. In the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  and in the Soviet Union» a great impulse to freedom and democracy welling up from below transformed political and economic systems frozen in place since the end of the Second World War. As those great changes gathered pace  the rift driven through the European continent two generations ago began at last to heal and the confrontation between hostile alliances - the most dangerous in all of human history - began to lose its purpose and to wind down.For a year now  each remarkable change has been a prelude to even greater change and to new and wider opportunities. East-West confrontation eased and turned increasingly to co-operation. Disarmament became a serious possibility and regional conflicts began to be addressed. Most dramatically of all  Germany  divided in 1945  has moved toward unity in response to the democratic wish of the German people and with the full goodwill of the international community.It has been a time of hope  notwithstanding the many serious problems that remain in international life. With the end of East-West confrontation  we had begun at last to emerge into a truly post-war world where the institutions of international order established after the Second World War could function as intended.Now  suddenly and unexpectedly  that hope is challenged and those institutions face a most serious test. A State Member of the Organisation  a leading member of the Hon-Aligned Movement and the Arab League  has attacked another by force  overwhelmed it and purported to annex it in flagrant breach of international law and of the most basic provisions of the Charter.We are therefore now faced with a most serious question. Can our system of collective security  of common action against any Member State that commits aggression  function as it was intended to? And if it does not  or if the will of the international community to uphold a system of order and justice end law between nations falters  who then will defend the weak against the strong?In the face of Iraq's aggression  the Security Council has taken action that is both decisive and unprecedented in the history of the Organisation. An extraordinarily high degree of consensus has been achieved among members of the Security Council and of the United Nations as a whole. We all subscribe to the principle of the inadmissibility of using force to settle disputes between States. It has been possible to reach a convergence of views on the steps to be taken to counter the use of force in this instance.Ireland believes that it is of the greatest importance that a political solution be found through the full implementation of all the resolutions of the Security Council. Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait and the legitimate government of that country must be restored. Until then  the economic and political pressure brought about by the Security Council measures must be maintained. The international community must make clear that behaviour such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is absolutely unacceptable. Without respect for international law  none of us is safe. Through the United Nations we must effectively reassert the rule of law.With our partners in the European Community  Ireland fully supports the Security Council resolutions already adopted in relation to the crisis in the Gulf. The safety and welfare of our citizens who have found themselves caught up in the situation in the Gulf as a result of having been in Kuwait or Iraq at the time of the invasion have been and will remain a priority for my Government. In concert with our partners  we are doing everything possible to deal with the difficulties caused to Irish citizens by Iraq's actions. We shall not cease in our efforts to secure their rights to exit from those two countries if they wish. We insist that the rights of Irish and other citizens be respected. The Gulf crisis has demonstrated the importance of the United Nations. This is the forum where the collective will of the international community can be expressed in the interest of the maintenance of international peace and security. This is where we can establish the parameters for a more secure and stable world order  now that the cold war can be assigned to history  h good beginning has been made in very difficult circumstances. The capacity of the United Nations to act in such situations is the central element necessary to provide the assurances we all need.The United Nations role in the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts in the past year must be recognized as a significant step forward. The United Nations has a legitimate task in the establishment of international standards for free and honest elections. The electoral success scored in Namibia justifies the unstinting efforts of the Organization over the past 25 years to bring freedom and democracy to that country  Nicaragua is yet another example of how well the Organisation can perform in that sphere.The long hoped-for emergence of agreement between the parties in Cambodia and the positive moves to peaceful resolution of the conflicts in El Salvador and the Western Sahara should present the Organization with an early opportunity to consolidate its expertise in election monitoring and to further the democratic tradition in areas where it has been lacking in the past.The peace-keeping role of the United Nations continues to attract a high level of interest and is likely to do so for the foreseeable future. If peace-keeping is to be retained as an integral part of the peace-making activity of the Organization  it must - I repeat  must - be accorded adequate political and financial support. The mandate given to our peace-keeping forces is never an easy one. Our forces operate under difficult  indeed often hostile conditions. Their motivation to serve the higher interest of peace and stability is and should be beyond question. Every effort must be made at the political level to ensure that that commitment is not in vain.If I dwell on this  it is because my country has  when asked  given liberally  and because we believe in the importance of this role. In particular  Ireland has participated in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since its establishment in 1978. That has not been without human cost. Thirty-one Irish soldiers have died while on service with UNIFIL  11 of them by hostile fire. Our involvement  however  will continue as a concrete expression of Ireland's support for bringing peace to Lebanon.If the United Nations is to carry out the expanded functions in prospect in the peace-keeping area  it must be given adequate resources to do so. Proper funding  clear guidance and the political will of the membership are all necessary in full measure to ensure a sustained effort. We have a challenge before us to emulate the efforts of past years in order to make the United Nations system relevant in the promotion of peace and democracy internationally.The promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms is inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Sights  as well as in the two international Treaties on human rights  which guide so much of our work in this field. In December 1989  Ireland ratified both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. At the same time  Ireland acceded to the First Optional Protocol to the former Covenant  which permits complaints by individuals. I therefore reaffirm Ireland's wholehearted commitment to the principles enshrined in those Covenants and the practices they imply. Throughout the world  there are still some countries where the human rights situation is less than satisfactory  where political and social systems continue to exist in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are violated. Irish public opinion continues to follow with concern the threats to human rights that still exist. We welcome the continued improvement in East-West relations and the genuinely revolutionary developments in Central and Eastern Europe. The political and social order established as an outcome of the Second World War has been overturned by the clearly expressed will of the people  expressed initially through peaceful mass demonstrations and restated through the democratic elections that have taken place. In most of those countries moribund political and economic systems have been replaced by vibrant new democracies that are now being consolidated  while reforms are under way to bring about market-oriented economic systems.An important symbol of such changes is the rapid process of German unification. This unity is a positive factor in the development of Europe as a whole and of the European Community in particular. It is taking place freely and democratically  in full respect of the relevant agreements and treaties and of all the principles defined by the Helsinki Final Act  in a context of dialogue and East-West co-operation. We wholeheartedly welcome those developments and are pledged to support them in appropriate ways  both by bilateral action and through our membership of the European Community.The overall positive trend is encouraging and suggests that it is possible to establish new relationships to replace the mistrust that has dominated Europe for almost 45 years and the confrontation between two fully antagonistic and mistrustful alliances. The artificial division of Europe must give way to unity based on mutual trust and the recognition of the common European identity and interdependence. In our view the most appropriate way to do this is to enhance and develop the process established by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) as the framework for lasting peace and co-operation in Europe. It is clear that the decisions to be taken at the next summit meeting in Paris in November will be of fundamental importance in this respect. We hope indeed to make significant progress here in New York next week in the preparations for that summit. Recent events in the Middle East have against demonstrated that despite positive developments in East-West relations  international stability is threatened by an adversarial approach to security  which often finds expression in increased armaments as well as in efforts to obtain possession of dangerous weapons of mass destruction. We continue to believe that real security can be found only through a co-operative approach  which seeks to build confidence between nations and to remove the fear of attack by eliminating the means of waging war and  in the first place  nuclear weapons.Ireland continues to be a strong and unqualified supporter of the Treaty on the Mon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We believe that the degree of consensus reached on a wide number of issues at the recent Fourth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty will strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime as a whole. While we regret that the Conference was unable to adopt a concluding document  we believe that the discussions have reinforced a commitment to the Treaty  and we look forward to redoubling efforts to ensure a successful outcome of the 1995 Review Conference and to agreement on extension of this vital Treaty.As a step towards the goal of the elimination of all nuclear weapons  agreement on a halt to testing of nuclear weapons and rapid conclusion of a comprehensive test ban would be the single clearest proof the nuclear-weapon States could offer of their commitment to complete nuclear disarmament and of their determination to control the qualitative development of the nuclear-arms race. We do hope for rapid progress towards this end.We look forward to the early achievement of an international agreement banning the production  possession and use of chemical weapons. We trust that the recent agreement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to reduce significantly their chemical-weapons stocks and to cease production of those weapons will facilities progress in the negotiations of a universal ban.The conflict in Cambodia has exacted a terrible toll in human suffering from the Cambodian people. The past 20 years have been witness to death and destruction on an enormous scale. We are greatly encouraged by the determined efforts of the international community over the past year to bring about a just and lasting solution to this tragedy  a solution that will incorporate the fundamental right of the Cambodian people to determine their own future free from outside interference.We welcome the role envisaged for the United Nations in bringing peace and justice to that troubled country. We must remain firm and resolute in our commitment to ensure for the people of Cambodia a future in which they may enjoy true peace  security and prosperity.We welcome the progress that has been made in the past year in South Africa and in particular the dialogue that has opened up between President De Klerk and the African national Congress of South Africa (ANC).At long last there are grounds for believing that the dark cloud hanging over South Africa may be lifting. The removal of the ban on political organizations  the release of Nelson Mandela  the partial lifting of the state of emergency and the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act are all important steps towards the abolition of apartheid. However  major obstacles remain to be overcome before it can be said that the apartheid system has been dismantled. The central pillars of apartheid - the Population Registration Act  the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts - continue in force. The great majority of the population of South Africa still does not benefit from the fundamental human right of franchise. It is essential that negotiations leading to a non-racial  united and democratic South Africa take place without delay. It is our fervent hope that all those who are working for a peaceful settlement of South Africa's problems can succeed in surmounting the most recent wave of violence that endangers the progress that has been made in recent months.We are all heartened by the recent positive developments on the Korean peninsula. In particular  we welcome the holding of the historic meeting of the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea and hopes that through intensified dialogue an improved climate of mutual trust and understanding will be generated. It remains our earnest hope that the Korean people will be fully represented in the United Nations in the near future. Simultaneous membership of the United Nations by the two Koreas can contribute to the process of defusing tensions in the peninsula. It would also be an advantage to our Organisation  bringing it significantly closer to the universal membership that is its vocation.While we have rightly concentrated in recent months on the need for an early and  if possible  peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis  we must not forget the other great source of tension in the Middle East the Arab-Israeli conflict.Ireland shares the view of its partners in the European Community that it is a further injustice to the Arab people that Iraq's aggression against Kuwait has delayed the search for progress towards a solution to the problems of the region  such as the Arab-Israeli conflict and the situation in Lebanon.We must resume the peace process with a view to a comprehensive settlement to be reached within the framework of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the representatives of the Palestinian people.The Middle East region has witnessed in recent years a plague of hostage taking. Everyone in Ireland was particularly overjoyed at the recent release of our compatriot Srian Keenan after almost four and one-half years in captivity. The last year also saw the release of a number of other hostages in Lebanon. I am truly delighted that these innocent people have been reunited with their families and with their friends. I earnestly hope that all hostages  no matter where they are being held or by whom  will be released. I appeal to all those who hold these hostages and to those who may be in a position to influence them to ensure their immediate  unconditional and safe release. The second special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic cooperation  which I had the privilege to address on behalf of the European Community  provided a timely opportunity to reflect on recent experience and to establish broad guidelines for progress in the 1990s. The common Declaration adopted at the special session recognises the responsibilities of each developing country for its own development and £or the institution of economic policies conducive to that end. At the same time it recognises the responsibility of developed countries to promote sustained international economic growth and to provide substantial concessional resources for development.The second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held at Paris from 3 to 13 September 1990  agreed on a Programme of Action for the 1990s to tackle the range of very difficult development problems facing the least developed. Their Special needs and those of other developing countries must be kept continuously in the forefront of our minds.The protection of the environment continues to be one of the issues of greatest concern to all our peoples  particularly in respect of the very serious environmental problems that confront the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. I am hopeful that in co-operation with those countries it will be possible to reach agreement on a series of concrete measures that will help to remedy the long years of neglect of the environment in that part of the world.The adoption of a major declaration on the environment by the European Council at its meeting in Dublin on 26 June is a clear indication of the importance the European Community attaches to environmental issues. The Declaration contains a statement of fundamental rights to a clear and healthy environment which the Community believes should be guaranteed to all its citizens. It stresses the importance of international co-operation in achieving this and repeats the view we all hold of our shared responsibility for protecting the environment of the planet.We have drawn attention in the past to the dangers posed by nuclear submarine traffic in' the Irish Sea and similar areas with extensive shipping and fishing activities. We cannot close our eyes to the possibility - and even the likelihood - that sooner or later an accident will occur  with what could be calamitous consequences for my country. Apart from the weapons they carry  the nuclear-power units of submarines are themselves a cause of concern. As has been suggested by a number of countries  we would urge the need to examine the feasibility of establishing agreed safety guidelines for sea-borne nuclear reactors.In recent months there have been indications that there may now be a willingness on all sides to address the problem of Northern Ireland in a way that holds promise of a durable solution. The extent of the commitment in that regard is a matter that will be tested in the weeks and the months ahead. For our part  my Government reaffirms its commitment to do everything possible to create the conditions and framework in which productive talks can get under way at the earliest possible date.We do not minimise the difficulties in our way. The potential participants in talks differ - sometimes profoundly - in their sense of the past and in their aspirations for the future. But we are encouraged by the extent to which a shared analysis of the problem is beginning to emerge. For perhaps the first time in 60 years a common vocabulary is being developed. On all sides the issue is now defined in terms of the three relationships - within Northern Ireland  between both parts of the island of Ireland  and between Britain and Ireland. The immediate task is to establish whether it is possible to find structures for talks which will properly reflect the interdependence of those three crucial relationships. For five years now the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been the bedrock on which Anglo-Irish relations have been conducted. The Agreement is not merely a statement of principle but also a programme for action. It is this dynamic element that gives the Agreement its strength and vitality. The past five years have seen an important series of advances brought about by the Agreement  including new and strengthened fair-employment legislation  more impartial policing of the marching season  an economic regeneration programme for West Belfast and the establishment of the International Fund for Ireland  with generous support from the United States  the European Community  Canada and New Zealand.Equally  however  an honest assessment would have to point up the distance still to be travelled. Fundamental questions remain about the role and behaviour of the locally recruited regiment of the British Army  the Ulster Defence Regiment  questions thrown into even sharper relief by allegations of collusion and related issues dealt with in the Stevens report. Harassment of members of the nationalist community by sectors of the security forces continues to be a source of the most serious concern. In the economic sector it remains to be seen whether the regeneration programme for West Belfast will fully respond to the dimensions of the problem or whether the new fair-employment legislation will have an effect in practice in reducing current imbalances in the work-force.The fundamental issues which the Anglo-Irish Agreement seeks to address - identity  equality and confidence - are at the heart of the problems of Northern Ireland. In any new arrangement better and more comprehensive ways may be found to address those questions  but the issues themselves cannot be dismissed or downgraded in importance. Those who urge that a new arrangement be put in place must understand the need for reassurance to the nationalist community that the intention is to go forward and not backwards. Memories of 60 years of Stormont rule and discrimination are not easily erased  especially since  for many nationalists  they are kept very actively alive by the continuing experience of Unionist control at local-authority level.The need for reassurance is not of course confined to one community. We fully recognize the concerns of Unionists - their fears and the sense of threat that many of their community live with. We are conscious that our understanding of the Unionist position would be greatly enhanced by hearing Unionist views at first hand. That is why we have so often and so genuinely expressed our readiness to enter into dialogue with leaders of that community. With so much of substance requiring discussion between us  it is surely in no one's interest that artificial barriers be placed in the way of such dialogue.I would wish  finally  that this body should be conscious of a particularly positive development in Anglo-Irish relations since our last General Assembly.Three cases dating from the mid-1970s in which Irish people were widely believed to have been wrongly convicted in British courts - the Guildford Four  the Maguire family and the Birmingham Six - have been of great concern to my Government and have cast a deep shadow over Anglo-Irish relations.Within the last year the innocence of the Guildford Four has finally been established  and the other two cases appear well on the way to resolution. The recent referral of the Birmingham Six case to the Court of Appeal is a particularly important and welcome development. Those six men have already spent 16 years behind bars. I know that concerned people everywhere will share my Government's very great sense of urgency about a satisfactory resolution of this case at the earliest possible date. The international community and this Organization face an important challenge in the period ahead. At the same time it is an opportunity  an opportunity to establish a more acceptable world order  a good beginning has been made. Let us dedicate ourselves within the United Nations to sustaining the effort needed to this end. The prize to be gained is great. It is also of the utmost significance for the future of all of us."
"70",3292,"IRN",45,1990,"I should like to express my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that under your wise and able leadership the current session will take effective steps at this very sensitive juncture  when the role of the United nations in resolving regional crises and confronting threats against international peace and security is being emphasized more than ever before.Our world is undergoing a rapid change. The tumulous changes in this decade  including the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran and the resurgence of Islamic revivalism across the globe  characterized by reliance on God  religion  morality and people; the decline of Marxist thought  which had been based on the negation of these very  basic characteristics  rapid developments in the socialist bloc  concomitant with effective participation by the masses in the management of their own affairs; unification of the two Germanys  signifying the end of the age of the supremacy of super-Power interests over the aspirations of nations - these  are all nothing if not clear evidence that we have arrived at the age of ever-increasing reawakening of nations. In this age  aggression  domination and exploitation - under the pretext of containing the rival Power  - will be resisted by hitherto repressed nations  but also the application of double standards to such phenomena and situations will be shunned by international public opinion. Now that it appears that the age of cold war and fierce super-Power rivalry has come to an end  if the transition in the international system fails to embody the principle of justice  and if the concentration of resources in certain specific parts of the world do not cater to the qualitative promotion of living standards and growth and development in the least developed and the developing countries  I venture to state that a real confrontation between the oppressed and their oppressors will be a forgone conclusion. This is far from being a threat  it is a realistic analysis of the objective conditions of human beings who are cognizant of the causes of their plight and their deprivation  and have come to realise that for the subjugated nations there exists no other choice but to overturn an imposed situation. Therefore  ensuring the rights of nations is of vital importance for the establishment of just and peaceful relations among States in the future international system. The evolution of the world order should create a milieu in which all nations can develop and realize their potential for growth  development and scientific and cultural progress. Economic justice  development and relative prosperity  social equality  promotion of respect for the rule of law in international affairs  non-resort to aggression and cohesion in the settlement of disputes and respect for sovereignty of all States should  inter alia  provide the foundations for the new international order. In this context  the role of the United Nations in guiding international development towards the realization of such common human ideals is indeed a sensitive and fundamental question.The raison d'etre for our presence in this prestigious world forum is to respect the will of the international community as crystallized in the purposes and principles of the United Nations enshrined in its Charter. In the light of the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and the current crisis in the Persian Gulf and the ensuing worldwide outrage  a glance at the realities and origins of the crisis and a comparison between Iraqi aggression against Kuwait and the aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran 10 years ago would indeed be in the order. Hours after the occupation of Kuwait the Security Council adopted a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter  demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Five resolutions  condemning the aggression  imposing comprehensive sanctions and calling for concerted international pressure  received the seal of approval of the Council in the span of two weeks; this makes a total of seven resolutions so far. All of a sudden  the major Powers in the Security Council  in particular the United States  rose to the defence of the Charter in an unprecedented manner  claiming that they would not allow any tempering with cardinal and universally recognized principles of international law  employing the means available to the international community in order to ensure the failure of the party which had chosen to solve its problems through resort to force and military occupation of another country  so that the aggressor would be denied any fruit of its aggression. A spectacular public international solidarity to corner the aggressor was painted in front of the unbelieving eyes of the world public. Let us now compare this pattern of behaviour with that of the same powers in the Security Council and their regional allies vis-à-vis the Iraqi aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran 10 years ago. At that time  the first Security Council resolution was adopted six long days after the aggression  and it only called for ``refraining from any further use of force''  without even referring to withdrawal. For the next eight years  support in all its imaginable forms - political  diplomatic  military  logistical  intelligence and financial - was lavished on Iraq in order to prevent the Iranian people from repelling aggression and regaining their legitimate rights. It appears as though for those eight years such principles as the inadmissibility of resort to force and occupation and the duty to suppress acts of aggression fid not exist in the Charter of the United Nations. The righteous positions of the Islamic Republic of Iran and those I  myself  pronounced every year from this very rostrum were all ignored  owing to the supremacy of the self-serving logic of hegemonic Powers over the principles of the Charter and the unfortunate negligence of some Aran States in the Persian Gulf of their long-term interest. This approach was pursued not only during the eight years of sacred defence by the Muslim people of Iran  but even during the two-year-long talks to achieve the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  during which not even a single word was uttered by the champions of international law in support of the mandatory requirements of their own resolution and of our legitimate rights  much less the realization of justice. Surprisingly  lack of progress in the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) was instead utilized by the same quarters as a means to seek political concessions from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Lack of real commitment to principles and manipulation of the rules of international law have created a situation in which the positions and statements of the parties to the current crisis are in blatant contradiction with their practices and policies during the past decade. The party calling on the nations of the region to resist the imperialist policies of the United States and its regional collaborators fought  in concert with the same imperialist policies  against the Islamic republic of Iran for eight long years. And the party now claiming to oppose aggression and uphold the principles of the Charter and the decisions of the Security Council is the very same State which  along with its allies and it total contravention of the Charter  dispatched the armada to the Persian Gulf  resorting to joint military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran  precisely in a bid to assist the aggression against Iran and to save the aggressor.  Against this background  the Islamic world will examine the realities as they are  notwithstanding the demagogic rhetoric  and cognisant of the fact that the origins of the current confrontation lie in a dispute over the expansion of gains  and not in a commitment to principles. Therefore  neither side can expect to command the support of Muslim public opinion unless it embarks on a practical ad clear course of rectifying its past policies. In view of the very dangerous end critical circumstances in the strategic Persian Gulf area and despite the tremendous damages incurred by the Iranian people as a result of the hostile policies of the major Powers and some regional States in the course of the past 10 years  the Islamic Republic of Iran has followed the developments with consistency  concern and keep interest  and has reacted accordingly. From the very outset of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  the Islamic republic of Iran clearly and unambiguously condemned Iraqi aggression and demanded the immediate  total and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Regrettably  the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait provided the pretext for foreign Powers  particularly the United States and other Western countries  to dispatch their forces on a massive scale to the Persian Gulf region. Recent statements by American officials signifying their intention - a long-term presence of United States forces in the area  and the creation of the new military and security arrangement in the region - are alarming  and certainly give rise to further instability and tension in the area. It would be a very great mistake for the United States to assume that Muslim people would be indifferent to  and silent in the face of  such a presence. We have repeatedly declared  even from this vary rostrum  that lasting peace and security in the volatile Persian Gulf region can be provided only by the countries of the Region. The religious  cultural and economic bonds between the countries in the Persian Gulf provide the fundamental incentives for their solidarity  and give them the necessary capability to preserve regional security  free from the presence and intervention of foreign forces. It is regrettable that some countries in our region have not yet appreciated the reality that foreign forces wok to further their own interests rather than those of countries in the region. Enjoying one of the longest tradition of contribution to human civilisation and global peace  the Islamic Republic of Iran  as the major country of the region  considers its national security to be intertwined with the stability of the sensitive Persian Gulf area  and has proved to be a pillar of regional stability and security. In this context  relying on the faithful Muslim people  it has resisted any foreign domination   as such domination is the cause of instability In the area.The Islamic Republic of Iran  while  as a matter of principle  condemning the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq and rejecting any alteration in the region's geography  which would certainly had to a state of permanent instability  considers the long-term presence of foreign military forces in the area to be detrimental to the interests and security of the countries in the region. It is the firm conviction of the Islamic Republic of Iran that faithful commitment to  and compliance with  the relevant Security Council resolutions by all countries - particularly Iraq - is the only path to the establishment of peace and tranquillity in our area. The Islamic Republic of Iran once again reaffirms its commitment to compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions  in line with its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. From the outset  we have made a very clear distinction between  on one hand  the process of peace and the resumption of good neighbourly relations with Iraq and  on the other bend  the current crisis in the Persian Gulf. On 14 August 1998 the President of Iraq  in a letter addressed to the President of the Islamic republic of Iran  reaffirmed the commitment of the Government of Iraq to the 1975 Treaty concerning State Frontier and Neighbourly Relations between Iran and Iraq. Since then  in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  Iraqi forces have withdrawn  in a military sense  from the occupied territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran  and a majority of the prisoners of war have been exchanged. The visit of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq to the Islamic Republic of Iran and the subsequent visit of the deputy Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Iraq   undertaken for the implementation of relevant provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  including the comprehensive  exchange of frontier lines in accordance with the 1975 Treaty  and other political issues of mutual interest  such as settlement of outstanding issues and the re-opening of the embassies  signify the mutual desire of the two sides for the establishment of peace between the two Muslim nations  which enjoy historical and deep-rooted religious and cultural bonds. I should like once again to express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  and to his distinguished colleagues for their tireless efforts towards implementation of resolution 598 (1987). It is our earnest hope that settlement of the dispute between Iran and Iraq  in accordance with the Security Council resolution  will provide a precedent for termination of the occupation of Kuwait and resolution of the current Persian Gulf crisis on the basis of relevant Security Council resolutions. The ongoing Persian Gulf crisis  which has seriously jeopardized regional  as well as global  security and stability and has brought the military build-up in the region to the threshold of explosion  does indeed underline the necessity of intensifying international efforts in the field of disarmament. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes that the most essential step for the realization of comprehensive and total disarmament  lies in fundamental changes in the military doctrines of major nuclear powers. These doctrines have  in the course of several decades  not only accelerated the arms race and the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  but have also contributed to the flare-up of many international and regional conflicts and crises  thereby derailing the limited resources of the developing countries from socio-political development to military-hardware acquisitions. So long as comprehensive disarmament has not materialized  the adoption of immediate measures  such as a comprehensive nuclear-test ban  the strengthening of the security of non-nuclear-weapon states against the use of the threat of the use of such weapons  and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world - in particular  the Middle east - ins indeed necessary for the preservation of international peace and security. In this context  the Islamic Republic of Iran  as the country most victimized by the use of chemical weapons in recent times  attaches particular significance to the conclusion of a chemical-weapons convention and is of the view that the comprehensiveness and universality of such a convention require the adoption of certain precise and all-inclusive provisions. Moreover  we believe that it is imperative that measures be taken to guarantee the security of the countries facing the threat of the use of chemical weapons. Equally  the major powers should refrain from insisting upon maintaining certain quantities of their chemical arsenals as security.The Middle East problem persists  and the oppressed Palestinian people continue to suffer. The regime occupying Palestine  whose very foundation is aggression and expansionism  continues to intensify its cruel crimes  and  in a vicious campaign to eliminate the Islamic resistance  has embarked on a persistent policy of expulsion of Palestinian inhabitants and of forcible demographic change  as well as the murder and injury of large numbers of the oppressed Muslim people of Palestine.  Nevertheless  the heroic intifadah of the Palestinian people  now in its third year  has amply proved that  despite the barbaric policies of the Zionist regime  this genuine popular movement for reassertion and regaining of the usurped rights of a revolutionary people continues to march forward. In the meantime the massive settlement of Jewish migrants in occupied Palestine has been a matter of deep concern. The Islamic Republic of Iran  while condemning this joint scheme of the Zionists and hegemonic Powers  believes that it is incumbent upon the international community to counter such illegal and inhuman practices. The Islamic Republic of Iran  stressing the necessity of preserving the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and respect for the right to self-determination of the people of Lebanon in accordance with the will of the majority  reaffirms its full support for the resistance of the Lebanese and Islamic national forces against the conspiracies and aggression of the Zionist regime. The Security Council's expeditious response to the recent act of aggression in the Persian Gulf has fostered the optimism that the Council is approaching  although belatedly  the realization that for the maintenance of international peace and security adoption of a resolute stance and effective practical measures to counter aggression is a logical imperative. Hence the Council is duty-bound to shoulder its institutional obligations vis-à-vis persistent Zionist aggression against Islamic lands and adopt effective concrete measure under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The question of Afghanistan  notwithstanding advances and setbacks in the course of last year  still remains unresolved. The Islamic Republic of Iran  as a neighbour of Afghanistan  and in light of common ties of religion  culture and history  cannot remain indifferent to the destiny of its neighbouring country and its Muslim people. While reaffirming our support for the struggle of the Muslim Afghan people  we stress the necessity for establishing an independent  Islamic and non-aligned government in Afghanistan enjoying good relations with its neighbours  which can only be attained through the unity of all Afghan Muslim people and respect for the wish of the majority expressed in a free election. We declare our readiness to play an active and serious role in assisting the Afghan people to hold free elections in the exercise of their inalienable  right to self-determination - a role emanating from the existing strong moral bonds between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Afghan people and the Mujahidin. The mechanism for free elections under the supervision of the United Nations  which was proved effective in turbulent areas such as Namibia  can be utilised with the  co-operation of neighbouring countries to bring the crisis in Afghanistan to an end. We hope that with the resolution of the Afghan problem and the emergence of a propitious situation  Afghan refugees can voluntarily and honourably return to their homeland. On the question of Kashmir  the Islamic Republic of Iran expresses deep concern over the violent trend of last year. It is to be hoped that through adoption of appropriate measures  and taking into account the demands of the Muslim people of Kashmir  fundamental steps for the peaceful settlement of this question will be taken. The Islamic Republic of Iran has  since the adoption of the historic Declaration of the special session of the general Assembly on apartheid  followed developments in South Africa with interest and concern. The release of nelson Mandela represents the beginning of a process  which can be completed only by the total dismantling of apartheid in South Africa and the formation of a non-racial government based on the free will of the people of that country. The Islamic Republic of Iran  inspired by the principle of the dignity and exalted worth of the human person  has always emphasized the civil and political  as well as economic  social and cultural rights and responsibilities of human beings and has attached prominence to the participation of all people in determining their destiny in political  economic  cultural and social fields. For more that a decade  the Islamic Republic of Iran participated actively in the Organization of the Islamic Conference in the drafting of the Declaration on Human Rights in Islam and  last December  hosted the concluding meeting of experts in Tehran to finalize that document. While in this context we continue to cooperate with the human rights organs of the United nations  and support relevant United nations activities geared to the promotion and betterment of the human situation  we are of the view that politically motivated and selective approaches in such organs would tarnish the very credibility and undermine the effectiveness of the Organization in this sensitive field. Creation of a healthy environment and a social milieu conducive to the preservation of human dignity and the growth of the personality of the human being calls for a concerted campaign at the global level against poverty  discrimination  moral decadence and crime. Drug addiction and trafficking is a social ill of global dimension  which not only destroys the body and the soul of millions of people but also lies at the root of rampant violence threatening the fabric of many societies. The Islamic Republic of Iran  because of its sensitive geographic position  has had to grapple with the transit of narcotics ad its pernicious effects on our society. We have adopted a comprehensive plan to combat this menace. Yet  experience has shown that success in eradicating the drug problem requires no less than a concerted and decisive international response  co-operation and programme of action. The eighteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  revitalisation of growth and development in the developing countries  was a welcome turning-point in our collective efforts to overcome economic crises in developing countries and to establish an equitable and balanced system equally benefiting the developed and the developing. In this context  the session's final declaration provides an appropriate framework for the resumption of the North-South dialogue. It took two long years of tireless efforts to agree on holding the session and to draft the text of its final declaration. This process  in order to come to fruition  requires not only the common will and political commitment of all countries but also the formulation of practical mechanisms and concrete steps  among which is the inclusion of an item under the same title in the agenda of the current session of  the General Assembly. Today we are gathered here in this Assembly at a time when the importance of  the role of the United Nations to attain international peace and security  counter aggression and promote friendly relations among all nations cannot beover-emphasized. International public opinion rightly expects this session of the General Assembly to be guided  without ulterior political motives  by the letter and spirit of the cardinal principles of the United Nations in confronting international conflicts  crises and challenges. The Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to play its part in the realisation of such lofty objectives."
"71",3339,"IRQ",45,1990,"﻿The present statement was scheduled to be made before the General Assembly by the Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country  Mr. Tariq Aziz. Unfortunately  Doctor Al-Anbari is feeling indisposed  which has prevented him from coming here to deliver this statement. He therefore charged me with making the statement on his behalf.The present statement was scheduled to be made before the General Assembly by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of my country. As matters stand  however  he has been prevented from doing so by the position of the United States authorities  as explained in the letter dated 23 September 1990 addressed to the Secretary-General by my country's Minister of Foreign Affairs and circulated in document S21812.As has been the case in past years  we requested the United States authorities to permit a special aeroplane carrying the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the members of the Iraqi delegation to land in New York. Those authorities  however  refused to grant our request and suggested the use of commercial airlines. This could only mean that the United States is in fact deliberately preventing the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country from coming to New York to participate in the proceedings of the General Assembly  present Iraq's point of view on the events and enter into dialogue with representatives of other States. It is worth mentioning in this regard that  in spite of our contacts with the Secretary-General and the United Nations Secretariat and its contacts with the United States Mission on the matter  the Secretariat has done nothing to press the United States side to reverse the measures which have prevented the Foreign Minister from participation.Having made this clarification  I shall now proceed to read the statement: ""Sir  it is a source of pleasure for me and ray delegation to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly's present session. In this regard  I should like to assure you of our total willingness and sincere desire to co-operate with you to ensure the success of your task.""My delegation expresses its congratulations to the delegation of Namibia  which is present at this session after the achievement by the struggling people of Namibia of its glorious victory against the racist Pretoria regime and the establishment of its newly independent State.""We also welcome Liechtenstein as a new Member of the United Nations Iraq also salutes the German people on the recent achievement of its unity. This has special significance for Iraq  which believes in Arab unity and aspires to it. Proceeding from this  Iraq hails and offers its blessings to the achievement of the unity of brotherly Arab Yemen.""The recent events which have taken place in the region have raised and continue to raise a number of vital issues which the international community  and the countries of the third world in particular  need to analyse deeply and draw the right conclusions from them. The reason is that these events and the way the United States and its Western allies have acted in relation to them indicate beyond any doubt that our world is entering a new era. Some would imagine that for the peoples of the world  and the peoples of the third world in particular  holds the promise of more favourable conditions than those which prevailed in the cold war era. However the bitter truth is that this new era is one of resurgence of Western imperialism under the leadership of the United States  at times with the tacit acquiescence of other great Powers and at others with their active participation.The Western imperialist alliance  under the leadership of the United States  is now orchestrating a large-scale disinformation campaign on a world level for which all the capabilities of the United States and Western political and information machinery - to say nothing of the military machine - have been pressed into service with a view to deluding the peoples of the world into believing that that alliance  whoso history in dealing with the causes of the world's peoples is dark indeed  has turned today into a defender of international law  the Charter of the United Nations and a so-called international order.Regardless of any diversity of views on the Kuwait issue  we must not ignore the quintessential issues which the United States and its allies are doing their best to obfuscate and overshadow with disinformation. Those issues are the following First  the United States and its allies are deliberately and arbitrarily trying to conceal the fact that the Kuwait issue has a history that has its roots in the colonialist past. In 1913  Britain took it upon herself to sever Kuwait from Iraq; the fact that all the successive Iraqi Governments over the past 70 years  regardless of whether they were monarchical or republican  have refused to accept that colonialist act. As a matter of fact  this question has been the subject of dispute in the Arab League and the United Nations in the 19608. At the same time  the United States and its Western allies are deliberately concealing the developments and events which have led to the present situation and the fact that they started several months before 2 August 1990 with a large-scale campaign of conspiracy  defamation and siege against Iraq which included boycott measures that covered the stoppage of food exports to Iraq and embraced the scientific and technological fields.On 4 September 1990 I addressed to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the world a letter in which I explained the history of this question and those developments. Therefore  I shall refrain from touching on these matters here.""Secondly  the events in question have taken place in the Arab region. This is a region which  for many decades  has had its own mechanisms and procedures for dealing with the problems which arise there. The events began on 2 August 1990. On 3 August  His Majesty King Hussein sought to convene  on 4 or 5 August  a mini summit meeting in Jedda  which was to be attended by Iraq  Saudi Arabia  Egypt  Yemen and Jordan and was scheduled to deal with the problem within the framework of the usual Arab mechanisms and procedures. But the Arab party that was supposed to host the meeting  namely  Saudi Arabia  reneged on the meeting after having agreed to have it convened. Two days after the date scheduled for that meeting. United States forces landed in the Arabian Peninsula. That makes it clear enough that it was the United States which put the Arab mechanism out of action and decided to take control of the political situation itself. One day after its forces had landed in the Arab Peninsula  the United States had its henchmen in the region convene a meeting in Cairo not with the aim of considering and dealing with the question within the mechanisms and procedures by which Arab issues are normally resolved but with a view to obtaining its collaborators' support for the United States occupation and United States control over the political situation  a matter which led to a sharp deviation in the ranks of Arab governments. Since then  sincere Arab parties have sought to restore the Arab mechanism and procedures for dealing with this question  but the United States has suppressed and reviled such attempts; it has even threatened the leaders undertaking them and used the Security Council as a tool to frustrate any sincere Arab effort.""Thirdly  this fact sheds light on what has taken place and continues to take place in the Security Council. From the very first day of the events  the United States has resorted to the convening of an emergency meeting of the Security Council and placed before the Council a resolution based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. For the first time in its history  the Security Council did not allow enough time for the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State concerned in the issue to be able to participate in its deliberations; nor did the Council provide any opportunity for the participation of any Arab representatives who could make a responsible contribution to those deliberation·. The United States called for the meeting at 4:45 New York time on the morning of 2 August; it submitted a draft resolution and insisted that it be adopted just hours after its submission; then it proceeded to build the subsequent political activity on the basis of that resolution though it knew full well that to have a resolution of that kind passed in such a hasty fashion would preclude all possibility of any serious and responsible search for suitable solutions to the issue  especially on the Arab side  It is especially regrettable that other international parties have yielded to this line of action which has blocked and continues to block the responsible approach to the issue. Resolution 660 (1990) is unprecedented in the history of the Security Council whether in terms of the hasty way in which it was passed and discussed or in terms of its direct leap to Chapter VII within the first hours of the occurrence of the events. Fourthly  in a manner which has no precedent in history of the United Nations  the United States and its Western allies had the Security Council pass a series of consequent resolutions  each of which has had the effect of causing further aggravation and escalation of the situation and of blocking every responsible effort to seek a resolution. In addition to this deliberate political hysteria on their part  the United States and its allies proceeded following the events to mobilize their fleets  their aircraft and their ground forces in the region in a manner that had had no parallel in contemporary history  thus bringing the entire region  and the entire world - to the brink of a devastating war.""Fifthly  we have to ask  and to ask forcefully with the events of contemporary history in mind  are the United States and its Western allies taking this stand to defend international law and the Charter and the just rights of peoples? If the United States and its Western allies are  as they now claim  such firm upholders of principles why then have all the problems and crises in the world remained unsolved? Why do we come here every year to complain of the continued existence of those problems and crises? To whom have our complaints been addressed? Have they not been addressed to America and its allies whose actions and policies have been at the root of the problems and crises as well as of the procrastination in resolving them? Have not America and its allies been the ones who have used the veto to gnash the resolutions we have submitted to the Security Council  thus providing a cover for the violations committed by their allies in Tel Aviv and Pretoria? Have they not been the ones who have treated with contempt the resolutions which  once in a while  we have succeeded in having adopted by the General Assembly where the third world States have a numerical majority? Why have the questions of Palestine  the Middle East and Lebanon remain unsolved to this very day? What was the fate that overtook the Security Council resolutions on those questions  which have numbered  so far  166 ¡resolutions? Why does Israel continue to occupy Arab territories and why bas it had the temerity to declare that they are part of the land of Israel? Why has Israel been able to call the West Bank  Judea and Samaria and declare that occupied Al-Quds is its eternal capital? Why has all this been possible under the vary eyes of those who have shown fir  resolve to have Security Council resolutions implemented - only after the Council adopted its well-known resolutions following the events of 2 August 1990?""The record of the United Nations is replete with condemnations of the policy of the United States. We all know the stand taken by the United States and its allies  especially Britain  towards such issues as independence  racial discrimination  coequal economic relations and the  any other issues which every year are presented here in the General Assembly only to be opposed by every possible means by the representatives of America and the Nest  thus hindering our sincere efforts to have the  resolved in accordance with international law  the United Nations Charter and the criteria of justice and equity.""The United States has used the veto 81 times to stop the adoption of Security Council resolutions which  in the majority of eases  dealt with the rights of the Palestinian people  Israeli aggressions against the Palestinian people and neighbouring Arab States  together with resolutions on South Africa. This year alone  the United States has used the right of veto seven tines to oppose draft resolutions on the question of Palestine. ""Furthermore  the resolutions which the Security Council has been able to adopt on the questions of Palestine  the Middle East and Lebanon  and in which it calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian and Arab territories it occupies  have not been implemented to this very day. The same is true of 44 resolutions on Lebanon adopted since 1978. Israel has continued to occupy South Lebanon since 1982.""The General Assembly  for its part  has adopted over 400 resolutions on the question of Palestine and the Middle East. The majority of those resolutions have been opposed by the United States. The resolutions  especially those which called for enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its inalienable rights  have not been implemented because  alone among the peoples of the world  the Palestinian people is denied recognition of its right to self-determination by the United States and Israel.""To this number must be added the many other resolutions on the rights of the Palestinian people and the question of the Middle East passed by the specialised agencies - resolutions which Israel has ignored just as it has ignored Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  relying on United States opposition to them. We would mention in particular the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organisation  the International Labour Organisation  the World Health Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.We are witnessing in this particular period a new campaign of settler colonialism taking the form of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries for the purpose of perpetuating the Zionist occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories and establishing the so-called greater Israel. The States which are sponsoring this campaign on the pretext of defending human rights and the right to emigrate  refuse at the same time to allow the Palestinian people to exercise those very rights the right to return to its homeland in spite of the numerous resolutions in which the United Nations  since 1948  has recognised the right of return and which have remained unimplemented to this very day. Now the Zionist emigration operation is being carried out at the expense of this Palestinian right and with a view to squeezing those Palestinians who have remained out of their land.""We Arabs  and we the peoples of the world  must not draw the wrong conclusions. The United States and its Western allies  who are raising such a hue and cry in connection with the recent resolutions which they have dictated in the Security Council  are not now experiencing a belated awakening of conscience. On the contrary  they are rushing the world  on a tidal wave of one of the most dangerous and pernicious campaigns of disinformation in history  into a new imperialistic era. In this they are taking advantage of the disruption of the international balance which followed the events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. There is now a rush to put that new imperialistic order in place and consolidate its foundation before the peoples of the world wake up  recover from the stunning blow and start looking for ways that would enable them to restore the balance in such a manner as to protect their independence and make it possible to base relations on a certain degree of justice. ""The rulers of the United States and its Western allies are neither defenders of international law nor upholders of the Charter. Just exactly as the United States President  George Bush  has stated  they are defenders of the capitalist monetary system  of which the investments by the former Kuwaiti regime  amounting to over $200 billion  constitute one of the principal props. They are seeking to gain control over the oil reserves in the Gulf so as to have a free hand in manipulating the needs of the world  and especially the needs of the peoples of the third world  for this important commodity. The United States is seeking  in a dangerously coercive vein  to impose its leadership on the world. This intention was disclosed byPresident George Bush in his speech before Congress on 11 September 1990  when he said that the American objectives in the Gulf were clear  and American goals were well-defined and well-known. America and the world  he said  must defend common vital interests  and in pursuit of these goals the United States should fear nothing. He emphasised that the involvement of the United States predated the events and would survive them. That is why the United States is raising artificial fears about Iraqi control of 20 per cent of the oil reserves while it and its Western allies were quite happy when those reserves were under the control of a handful of sheikhs.""The real reason for this operation to incite fear is that Iraq  although it is an oil-producing country  considers itself  both in fact and in principle  a third-world country  a country that shares the feelings of other third-world countries  stands in solidarity with them and upholds their causes. In the 1970s  before the war with Iran  Iraq had given more than $9 billion in aid to various countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America.""That  then  is the reason. They are out to fight against the control by an independent country over its national wealth  of which it was robbed by force and conspiracy in the days of colonialism. They are dead set against the investment of such wealth in sound self-reconstruction. Their aim is to ensure that that independent country should not become an active party in extending selfless  disinterested assistance to its brother Arab and third-world States as it did up to 1979.""When  on 10 September 1990  Iraq announced that it was prepared to supply oil  free of charge  to third-world countries  the United States and its allies mobilised their political and military machine to intimidate those countries and make transportation of the oil impossible. Now those countries are compelled to pay twice the price they paid just a few weeks ago. On the other hand  the United States  which until a few weeks ago resisted normal and balanced increases in the price of oil in response to supply and demand  is now intent on keeping the price high  because it is now blackmailing its oil-producing allies into using the earnings accruing from the higher prices to cover the heavy financial costs of its military build-up against Iraq.""We must fully ponder the generosity shown by the United States  the other major capitalist countries and the capitalist Arab countries in defraying the expense of the military build-up against Iraq. In the course of a few weeks  some $20 billion has been amassed for that campaign. When did these countries ever show such generosity and raise even a few million dollars to provide relief to those who die of hunger in Africa  to the millions of refugees from the wars in Afghanistan and Cambodia  or to the Palestinian refugees who have been and continue to be expelled by Israel from their own land?""When did these countries ever show such generosity in dealing with the problems of indebtedness that are crushing third-world peoples in Latin America  Africa and Asia? When did these countries ever show any generosity at all in helping countries in the Middle East region that are suffering crippling economic crises? One of those countries  a country which has enlisted in the ranks of the American campaign  has hundreds of thousands of citizens who actually live in cemeteries in the absence of any realistic hope of finding any kind of housing.""The United States is not doing what it is doing for the sake of the Charter  international law or the rights of peoples. The United States and its Western allies are seeking  through this military  political and information campaign  to gain control over the oil-fields and to impose their imperialist political  economic and military hegemony over the world  especially over the countries of the third-world.""Therefore  the countries of the third-world should be on their guard against being carried away by the disinformation campaign now being orchestrated by American and Western imperialism. The countries of the third world should take cognisance of the quintessential facts of the situation and should look after their own very real interests. Should any of them have their own views on the subject of Kuwait  they would be well advised to avoid taking hasty positions before acquainting themselves with the facts as they really exist on the ground and should not confuse their own motives with the ulterior motives of America and its allies. America and its allies are only seeking to provide a cover with their disinformation campaign for the imperialist aims which lie behind their military occupation of the Gulf and of the Arabian Peninsula.""From all this  there clearly emerges a basic fact that cannot be ignored - namely  that in the Middle East region there are so many bitter and complex issues that it would be practically impossible to give preference to one over the other. The whole region is seething with anger and teeming with explosive problems. Such was the case before August 1990. What used to be said from this rostrum by the representatives of the States in the region confirms this fact. Therefore  if the five permanent members of the Security Council  and the Security Council as a whole  are really interested in upholding the Charter and international law and are really earnest in wishing to establish peace and justice in the region  the way to such goals is well known. On 12 August 1990 President Saddam Hussein proposed that all the issues of the region - Palestine  Lebanon  the Gulf  and others - should be considered on an equal footing; that the Security Council should seek to establish common principles and criteria to deal with these issues; and that these principles and criteria should be applied in dealing with all the issues of the region  with due attention to the particularities and backgrounds of each issue. In this way  it would be possible to achieve real justice and peace  resolve the difficult problems of the region  and make the people there feel that they can have peace and can look forward to a future.""A number of countries have shown interest in these ideas  but the United States and Britain have sought to suppress any tendency to give them consideration. This indicates bad faith and an unwillingness to deal with the issues of the region on an equitable basis. It even amounts to a reaffirmation of the insistence of the United States and its allies in dealing with the issues of the region and of the world with double standards.""The free countries of the world that really believe in the Charter and in international law  and are sincerely interested in peace  are under an obligation to press unremittingly for a comprehensive and just solution to all the issues of the region."""
"72",3386,"ISL",45,1990,"Allow me  Mr. President  to congratulate you on your election to our highest office  presiding over this forum of the world's nations. I wish you every success and pledge you the sincere support of my delegation.I am delighted also to be able to use this opportunity to welcome Liechtenstein  our partner in the European Free Trade Association  as a new Member of the United Nations. Our session is taking place this year against the background of earth-shaking events. Rarely has the United Nations been faced with challenges in world affairs as diverse or demanding as those it is currently being called upon to deal with. At the same time  we have a rare opportunity to make our world Organization fulfill the dreams of its founders.In the last twelve months  a whirlwind of change has swept across the world. An air of co-operation and mutual trust has replaced the atmosphere of confrontation and distrust which marred East-West relations for over forty years. In Central and Eastern Europe dictatorships have tumbled and the ideology of communism is totally discredited. In a matter of days  Germany will be united and the last remaining symbol of a Europe divided thereby abolished. Conditions have thus been created for engineering of a new order of peace and stability in Europe - in short  for rebuilding a Europe whole and free. The benign effects of this profound transformation have been felt world-wide. For the first time we can now expect that energies  previously drained by military competition and the selfish pursuit of national ends  will be channelled into co-operative efforts in the service of humanity as a whole. The new  unprecedented commitment to collective action has brought in its wake certain undisputed advantages for the United Nations also. It has removed obstacles and given the Organization increased scope to exercise its powers in the interest of world security under the United Nations Charter. Recent successes  mainly in the area of regional disputes  have bolstered public confidence in the world Organization.  What a peculiar quirk of circumstances it is  therefore  that at precisely such a triumphant moment in its history the United Nations should be faced with the greatest test of its character in recent years. The invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq are not only a flagrant violation of international law but a frontal attack on the very ideals of the United Nations. Surely it must be our foremost task to see to it that this first major crisis of the post-cold-war period does not make us turn back the clock in international affairs.The world community has condemned the brutal aggression and unjustifiable acts perpetrated against thousands of foreign nationals held by Iraq against their will. The United Nations Security Council has reacted swiftly and with unanimity. But more will be required. To restore calm to the Persian Gulf the world community must demonstrate its undivided support for the resolutions of the Security Council and the actions of those who  in conformity with those resolutions  have assumed the burden of establishing a multinational force in the Gulf area. Given the heavy cost involved for a number of States  this will require an unusual degree of resolve and co-operation. Failure to display the necessary solidarity incurs the risk not only of undercutting the authority of the United Nations but also of undoing the progress achieved so far in our long and hard struggle for peace in the world at large. The show of military aggression we have recently witnessed in the Persian Gulf reveals the volatile nature of peace in the world  even at a time when the super-Powers have forged a new partnership to contain such crises. We are reminded that peace in the world is not simply the absence of war but presupposes the acceptance of fundamental precepts of international conduct  including respect for national sovereignty  the right to self-determination  and the inviolability of international borders. In a European context these principles have been enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Not least for that reason  we welcome the unification of Germany which  in accordance with the wishes of the German nation  will take place a few days from now. The establishment of new legal relationships between the parties concerned now offers a realistic prospect of long-term stability on the continent of Europe. But while a new order of Europe is taking shape let us not turn a blind eye to those remaining features of the post-war era which have stubbornly resisted the forces of change. The situation of the Baltic republics is a case in point. The Baltic nations were independent States  recognized as such by the international community  a fact which military occupation and annexation cannot be allowed to change. In the long run there can be no solution to this problem short of the full recognition of the Baltic republics’ right to independence. It is to be welcomed that a political dialogue has now been established between the Baltic republics and the leadership of the Soviet Union and its constituent republics that will  it is hoped  pave the way for an orderly return to the status quo ante.In the meantime Iceland  like other Nordic countries  wishes to see co-operation extended to the Baltic republics at various levels. Iceland would  furthermore  welcome the full participation of the Baltic republics in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.Although elements of our post-war legacy may thus remain  there can be no denying that the armed peace among the major Powers is gradually being replaced by a more trusting set of relationships  where negotiated arms control and confidence building play an important role. The East-West rapprochement has greatly enhanced the prospects for meaningful arms control. Significant progress has already been made in three major categories of modern weaponry: conventional  nuclear and chemical. In the conventional area  it is of the utmost importance that a treaty between the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and those of the Warsaw Pact to cut conventional forces in Europe be concluded as soon as possible. A conventional-force agreement  which should result in a defensive posture of military forces on the continent  constitutes a basic requisite for a new structure of security in Europe. It is to be hoped that negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to reduce and limit their strategic nuclear forces will also lead to the substantial diminishing of the nuclear threat in the near future. The current renaissance of the United Nations should serve to highlight the useful work of the Organization in the area of arms control  both in the General aSSembly and at the Conference on Disarmament. At the Conference on Disarmament a global convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons remains a priority. In the light of the bitter experience of the past  it is deplorable that these the most abhorrent of modern should still be used against innocent civilians.It is to be welcomed that the Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban has been re-established within the Conference on Disarmament. Ultimately all nuclear-weapon testing must be brought to a halt. In the meantime the nuclear Powers must take effective measures to prevent the spread of radioactivity from their nuclear-testing sites. The Nordic countries  concerned about the serious danger that radioactive emissions and leaks might pose to the natural environment of the northern region  have urged the Soviet Union to abandon plans to transfer all its nuclear testing to the island of Novaya Zemlya. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains the single most important multilateral agreement on disarmament and arms limitations. Since its entry into force no non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty has acquired nuclear weapons. The recent Fourth Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty has strengthened this regime still further. Nevertheless  it is still a matter of concern that a number of States remain outside the Treaty. The crisis in the Gulf has underlined the urgent need to deal more effectively with the problem of proliferation in the nuclear  chemical and biological fields.On the whole the direction of current arms-control negotiations is to develop regimes for the most major areas of armament: the full spectrum of nuclear forces  conventional land and air forces in Europe  and chemical weapons. The only major area of armament not yet included in the arms-control agenda is the naval one. Sooner rather than later arms control will also have to extend to naval forces. In a European context  failure to include naval forces in arms-control negotiations could result in a differentiation of areas of security.No one can deny that progress in arms control has taken place mostly outside the confines of the United Nations. This is not the case in the area of the protection of human rights  where the United Nations has played a central role.The United Nations has been a pioneer in the definition of human rights through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other instruments. Having set the standards  the Organization has also acted decisively to implement them. The community of nations now recognizes that the pronouncements of international bodies on human rights should not be regarded as unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of individual States. However  this is not without exceptions  the obvious example still being South Africa.The realization by the people of Central and Eastern Europe of the indispensable role of human rights in the pursuit of prosperity and happiness has certainly been among the principal factors motivating the positive developments in their part of the world. Unfortunately  this lesson of the recent past seems to have been lost on the leaders of South Africa  who still maintain a notorious system of oppression. Over the last year there has been a relaxation  but no major change  in the system of apartheid. The evils of the system remain and continued pressure must therefore be brought to bear on the South African leadership to respect the inalienable human rights of all citizens.The Middle East is another area which gives cause for ever-growing concern. Lately  the problem of Israel and the Palestinians has been dangerously linked with the Iraq-Kuwait affair. Iraq  having grossly misjudged the temperament of the times  now finds itself encircled by a huge majority of States supporting the resolutions of the Security Council. Having few options left  Iraq has tried to stir up Arab opposition to Israel in order to line up Arab States on its side. That is demagoguery of the most dangerous kind. Even if Iraq does not succeed in spreading the fires from the Gulf area  the intractable problems of Israel and the Palestinians remain. Clearly  a peaceful settlement of the dispute will have to be a part of a comprehensive new order for the whole Middle East. To bring this about  Arabs and Israelis must take upon themselves the leading role. More encouraging news has recently come out of South East Asia. For some time it hash sen clear that the vexatious problem of Cambodia can only be solved through the good offices of the United Nations. The agreement of the warring factions in Cambodia to commit themselves to a United Nations framework for a comprehensive peace settlement in Cambodia is a major breakthrough. To gov peace a chance  any possibility that the Khmer Rouge might again seize power must be eliminated. Hopefully  the comprehensive peace settlement marks the beginning of a new and stable security arrangement for the South East Asia region as a whole. I referred earlier to the salutary world-wide effects of the transformation we have recently witnessed in Europe. But we cannot ignore concerns that financial assistance in support of the current drive towards market economies in Central and Eastern Europe might absorb assistance otherwise earmarked for the developing countries. While difficult choices must be made  it is imperative that the industrialized countries find the appropriate balance in this regard.Expanded and balanced world trade depends on economic improvement both in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in the developing world. The enormous foreign debt burden of those countries must be relieved and the means found to create a more equitable sharing of financial resources between the developing countries on the one hand and the industrialized world on the other. Financial assistance and debt relief must be combined with comprehensive plans for structural change. Bridging the gap between North and South will also require more attention being given to social factors  to health care  nutrition and education.  The principal task of development must be to secure for children health  nourishment and education. In the midst of peacekeeping activities  the United Nations has decided to put the children in world focus through the high-level meeting next weekend. We must all of us  developing an developed States  give a high priority to the children - to our future. let us also bear in mind that a direct link exists between environment and development. The protection of the environment is one of the vital issues confronting the United Nations. Important groundwork has already been laid in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development in ordering priorities and recommending future options.For a country like Iceland  overwhelmingly dependent on the resources of the sea  safeguarding the environment is a question of survival. From our point of view  it is of the utmost importance to take effective measures against pollution of the maritime environment  not least from land-based sources and radioactive waste.The protection of the marine environment from nuclear contamination has not been dealt with adequately. Following Chernobyl  considerable attention has been given to nuclear reactors on land. But we cannot forget that sea-borne nuclear reactors are in reality mobile power plants. As such  they should be given no less serious consideration than nuclear reactors on land. During this session of the General Assembly  Iceland will propose a United Nations expert study on the potential risks to the marine environment posed by accidents involving sea-borne nuclear reactors. In Iceland’s view  existing legal instruments in the field of environmental protection are not sufficient to achieve the results we desire and should therefore be strengthened. International treaties in specific fields of the environment need to be negotiated. Hopefully  agreements on climate change and biological diversification will be adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. But a more comprehensive approach is called for. What is needed is an agreement on the basic principles which must guide the community of States to ensure future sustainability of life on Earth. These principles should be embodied in a new  concise legal instrument which would be accepted by Governments as a constitution or charter. The Conference on Environment and Development may be our best chance to take realistic steps to reverse the environmental degradation of our planet. Care must be taken that that this does not become a meeting of empty generalities  mere declarations or timid action plans. Specific environmental problems must be dealt with concretely within the overall context of sound and sustainable development. Time is not on our side in this great venture. It is estimated that during the next two years nearly 100 million acres of tropical forests will be extinguished: 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide and other toxic pollutants will foul the air. In two years 50 billion tons of productive topsoil will be lost. To turn the tide in matters like these  matters of survival  will indeed be a major undertaking for our regenerated Organization in the years decades ahead. "
"73",3433,"ISR",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  I would like to congratulate you  at the outset  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly and to wish you every success. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continuous and outstanding endeavours in the service of world peace and accommodation among nations.We live in an era of sweeping aspirations for freedom  liberty  and the establishment of peace among nations. At the same time  it is a period in which tyranny rears its head  trampling cherished values of humanity while grinding into dust the sovereignty of nations.In Eastern Europe  the fabric of a new spring of nations is being woven before our eyes. In Western Europe  the crystallization of the Community of Europe into a powerful and cohesive alliance of nations continues  transcending barriers and unifying hearts and nations. The enlightened leadership of that great democracy - the United States - reaps the fruits of its victory: the ascendancy  across continents  of the values of liberty and respect for humankind.A widespread perception has held sway for decades  contending that the thawing of hostilities between East and West would usher in the attainment of global peace. Ostensibly  the consecration of this thaw enhanced the prospect that the world was  indeed  on the threshold of an epoch which would render war obsolete. This optimistic supposition failed to take into account the true and feckless nature of some Middle Eastern and Persian Gulf regimes. The proposition also ignored the fact that this violence-prone and conflict-ridden region became  increasingly  a global sieve for the surpluses of arms. Certain States in this region are run by autocratic rulers driven by fanaticism. This combination of destructive capabilities at the disposal of rulers with destructive inclinations has created ominous threats to the peace and security of the region and the world. These are the factors which engendered the crisis in the Persian Gulf. For many years the countries of the world assisted in the military build-up of Iraq. They believed that in so doing they were contributing to the containment of Khomeini's Iran. East and West alike inadvertently created a horrific and dangerous monster.In 1981 Israel destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor. As members know  that action was not universally welcomed. Today  however  the world realizes that the far-reaching military arm of Israel was guided by a far-sighted political outlook. The situation in the region  and even that of mankind as a whole  would have been different had Saddam Hussein been in possession of a nuclear bomb today.For 10 years the free world continued to shore up and consolidate Saddam Hussein's power. He was provided with quantities of all kinds of weaponry. The Arab countries themselves - including Kuwait - placed at his disposal enormous financial resources to fund the building of his engine of destruction. From Europe and Latin America  from East and West  came the transfer to Iraq's dictator of technological expertise and the means for the development of terrible chemical weapons  which he threatens to use  in accordance with norms of war more brutal and vicious than the laws of the jungle  as he has himself admitted.Private corporations in the West continued to supply him with the knowledge and technology for his efforts which almost reached fruition; the possession of the nuclear weapon. By their own actions  all those countries contributed to this terrible and pernicious machine which threatens them today.That megalomaniac tyrant  incapable of weighing his actions rationally  does not subscribe to the logic of balance of terror. That man  who stops at nothing  has already proved to the world his willingness to employ chemical weapons  using them against his own Kurdish countrymen. He has exposed his ruthlessness to the world by sacrificing the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Iranians in a futile and nonsensical war which he unleashed against Iran for 8 years. This chilling military might devoid of any morality catapults the world back to the nightmare years of the 1930s and 1940s.On the eve of his invasion of Kuwait Saddam Hussein threatened to destroy Israel if Israel should attack Iraq or any other Arab country. But he was fully aware that Israel had no intention of attacking Iraq or any other Arab country. As we know  he himself was the one who attacked Iran  and who decimated many of his own people  the Iraqi Kurds. We was the one who invaded Kuwait  who was on the brink of launching an assault and perhaps even of annexing Saudi Arabia and who now threatens to shell and destroy all the oil sources of the Arabian peninsula.He has trampled upon the sovereignty of nations  and placed the global economy in danger. All the efforts made to achieve global peace  which have already found expression in the rapprochement between nations and political systems  are now overshadowed by a terrible genie which could spew out of the oil wells of the world in pillars of smoke that will eclipse the sun.At this time  as the General Assembly of the United Nations is in session  Saddam Hussein threatens to attack Israel and bring about its destruction in retaliation for United Nations solutions or resolutions. He cocks a gun at Israel's heart  in the hope of extricating himself from punishment in keeping with international law.The free world should know that Israel will not sacrifice its security as the price of United Nations decisions aimed at safeguarding their economic well-being and freedom. Israel will know how to defend itself if attacked  and its response will be harsh and painful. This reality  however  does not absolve the international community from the responsibility of taking firm measures to put an end to this regime which is threatening the stability of the entire region and runs the risk of undermining the world economy.We are witnessing an unfolding drama. The United Nations should not allow this drama to be enshrined in the annals of history as a tragedy.The latest developments in the Middle East provide us with yet another opportunity to assess and evaluate the Arab-Israeli conflict in the appropriate historical and political light. For decades the underlying causes of this protracted and bitter dispute have stemmed from the refusal of the Arab States  with the exception of Egypt  to recognise the right of Israel to exist. This uncompromising Arab position has been the cause of successive wars imposed on Israel and has manifested itself in venomous anti-Israel propaganda  economic boycotts  acts of terrorism and blatant acts of aggression.For two generations Arab countries have squandered their natural resources  their wealth and their peoples' well-being in a continuous  all-embracing arms race  with Israel as the target. The awesome toll of this futile and unnecessary undertaking has been and is - but I hope it will not continue to be - the loss of human life  the abandonment of the prospects of development and socio-economic prosperity for the region as a whole and the perpetuation of self-destructive hostility.Today  a great cry of distress is being heard. From this region of the world  which bestowed upon humanity the Book of Books  the Koran and the New Testament  emanates the cry of humanity and its pleas for mercy  expressed in the prayer of every Jew: ""And I will give peace in the land  and ye shall lie down  and none shall make you afraid"". (Leviticus  2616) At a time when the cold war is ending and being replaced by an ardent desire for co-operation  a period in which the international community has come to regard the toppling of the Berlin Hall as a symbol of a new era in relations between peoples and Governments  the international community can no longer countenance the continued existence of the solid wall of Arab hostility encircling Israel to stifle that only truly democratic country in the Middle East.Such a state of affairs must no longer be accepted as a foregone conclusion. It is not a law of nature. This blind hostility by Arab Governments towards Israel should not be allowed to fester as an eternal curse. The Iron Curtain is collapsing in Europe. Can we tolerate the continued existence in the Middle East of a ""sand curtain""  setting that region apart from a world marching towards peace?Since Israel achieved its independence in 1948 and was invaded by seven Arab States in an attempt to destroy it  Israel has never ceased extending to those countries the offer of peace. Today more than ever before peace is a vital necessity for all the countries of the region. In that spirit  I appeal once again to the leaders of the Arab countries to settle this protracted dispute through direct negotiations  free from all shackles and pre-conditions.To advance this process  it would be appropriate to initiate and encourage mutual confidence-building measures. Such measures could induce a gradual reduction in hostilities and tensions and the cessation of hostile rhetoric  belligerence and terrorism. That is the  path recently followed by the East and West blocs in achieving the rapprochement that made a significant contribution to reducing the hostilities between the two blocs and led to the collapse of the barriers separating them. A similar process forged the route to the peace agreements between Israel and Egypt.Should a complete and immediate solution to the dispute prove impossible to achieve  let us build peace step by step. Each step will contribute to the enhancement of mutual understanding  the easing of tensions and the consolidation of good-neighbourly relations. First and foremost  the States of the region should proclaim forthwith the termination of the state of war and should meet  as Israel has proposed many times in the past  in the context of a conference on disarming the Middle East of chemical and other weapons.Israel extends to its neighbours an offer of broad co-operation to ensure the prosperity and well-being of our peoples and alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings. Israel is prepared to make available to its neighbours the expertise and experience it has acquired  particularly in desalinating sea water and making the deserts flourish. We shall share with our neighbours our experience  our expertise and our technological advances in such fields as solar energy  innovative irrigation techniques and modern agricultural methods  as well as plans for developing road and other communication infrastructures. In so doing we shall meet the challenges of disease  famine and poverty. Together we shall work for the reintegration of the refugees  whose profound misery is the price of the rejection of peace.If only the Arab states were prepared to foreswear the state of war and embark on the road to peace  they would contribute - I are sure - to finding a solution to the Palestinian problem. In Israel's peace initiative of May 1989  much political and practical thought was given to the ways of grappling with both those challenges. Israel is determined to continue its efforts to ensure the realisation of its peace initiative.In Israel’s peace initiative the right has been offered to the Palestinian inhabitants of Judea  Samaria and the Gaza district to join as negotiating partners with Israel in determining their destiny and future. This right was never given to the Palestinians by any of the former empires or regimes  including Jordan.It is the PLO which has been  and continues to be  the obstacle to the fulfilment of this unprecedented opportunity. It is the PLO that cot only carries out repeated acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians  but also brutally murders Palestinians. More than 300 Palestinians have been murdered by the PLO in the wake of Israel's peace initiative  in an attempt to impose a reign of fear and terror  using the same methods as the PLO's ally Saddam Hussein. We shall continue to combat terrorism and we reject its perpetrators as interlocutors. But that should not debar the peaceful forces among the Palestinians from joining us forthwith at the negotiating table to further the peace initiative that we have proposed. It is good for them; it is good for us; it is good for the whole region; it is good for the entire world.These days Israel is adding a new chapter to the epic of its national regeneration. The Soviet Union has unbolted the gates and allowed Jews to return to their ancestral land  a wondrous vision is unfolding before our very eyes: tens of thousands of Jews are regaining their national identity and rejoining their brethren in their homeland.This historic process is one of the fruits of the transformation taking place in Europe. The ideals of freedom at the basis of respect for human rights and dignity have finally been accepted in the East. Democracy is dawning on the horizon. The Western countries that have adhered to the principles of freedom and democracy have made a significant contribution to this development  as has the firm resolve of successive Presidents of the United States to impart those principles to the peoples of the world.There has emerged in the Soviet Union a bold  wise and realistic statesman  who has initiated a dramatic turning-point in his country. The walls of hostility between regimes and peoples have finally been dismantled. We are following this course with hope - hope for the Soviet people  for Europe  for ourselves and for mankind as a whole. This transformation has freed liberty and democracy from its chains.In Israel too we are happy about this transformation  which has enabled our people to return to Zion. We are grateful to the democratic Governments of the world  and especially to Presidents Reagan and Bush  who  by their devotion  have contributed to opening the gates of freedom. The Organisation  the community of nations  envisioned as a place of freedom and independence  is overshadowed by a heavy cloud which formed with the passing of the nefarious resolution comparing Zionism with racism.That resolution - which dares to treat as a racist movement the liberation movement of a people  which  more than any other  has suffered from racism - has become one of the most flagrantly racist propositions of modern times. That resolution sullies the Charter of the United Nations.For several generations  the people of Israel - which proclaimed to humanity the universal message of peace - has devoted its efforts to bringing about the national renaissance on the land of Israel. The word shalom - peace - represents the essence of all that has been revealed to the people of Israel. It constitutes also its message to humanity. The attainment of peace is the loftiest aspiration of every Jewish person. It is an integral part of his daily prayers. It is the word used both for greeting and farewell. When we meet each other we shake hands and say shalom. meaning peace.	We say that it is the Creator of the universe Himself who makes peace reign. It is even one of His glories. It is written: ""We who makes peace in the heavens  may We make peace upon us.""This longing for peace has always characterized the people of Israel. And it is with this ethos  today as in ancient times  that Israel's hand is extended in peace to all nations. Israel is one of the few countries against which war has been wag@£ continuously since its creation. Israel must assiduously safeguard its security and its future  with the same degree of resolve and determination with which it safeguards its principles and values and strives to achieve peace.In the spirit of Yom Kippur  this day of forgiveness  the holiest of the holy days for the Jewish people  let our prayer be raised from this rostrum: May the Lord give strength unto His people - and to all mankind. May the Lord bless all peoples  including the people of Israel  and give them peace.With this prayer in our holy language  I now draw to a close my statement  my remarks and my appeal  in the hope that the appeal will be heeded and will lead to a new era of construction  an era of confidence  of understanding  expectation and co-operation among all peoples  particularly the peoples of the Middle East."
"74",3480,"ITA",45,1990,"﻿Sir  on taking the floor on behalf of the European community and its member States  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am very happy to do so also because you represent a country with which Italy and the European Community maintain traditional relations of friendship and co-operation. You take up the presidency at a very difficult time of challenge for the United Nations. I am sure that your experience and diplomatic skill will greatly help to ensure a fruitful and constructive forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  in the interest of the international community. Let me also express the fullest appreciation of the European Community and its member States to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in favour of international peace.I should also like to welcome warmly the admission as a full Member of the United Nations of Liechtenstein  a member of the European family with which the European Community and its member States maintain close and friendly relations. I also warmly welcome the unification of Yemen.She positions of the European Community and its member States on the problems affecting the international community are fully illustrated in a memorandum which has been circulated today and which forms an integral part of my statement. Let me therefore concentrate here on some crucial aspects of the present situation. Perhaps never in the post-war period has the international climate changed so radically from one General Assembly to the next. How different what I have to say on behalf of the European Community is from what I would have said not only one year ago but even just two months ago. This is the first General Assembly of the new world emerging from the lengthy post-war period. It is also the first that it has to deal with a crisis arising after the end of the cold war. We are thus subjected to conflicting feelings of satisfaction at the end of East-West opposition and of concern at a new crisis arising from Iraqi aggression against Kuwait  which gives us a glimpse of new risks and new confrontations.For the first time a State has been wiped off the map. This has not happened in the Middle East since the end of the Ottoman Empire. The very justification for the aggression is a challenge to international legality and to the political structure in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein claims that all borders in the region were drawn up artificially to divide up the Arab nation and that the time has come for Baghdad to erase them and establish unity by force of arms.In the developing world in particular  many countries have equally precarious borders  some even more recent than those erased  which are capable of whetting further appetites. Tariq Aziz  the Iraqi Foreign Minister  claims that other Gulf States  such as Qatar  have no historical legitimacy. If that challenge were to go unanswered  it would herald a period of troubling uncertainty for the international community  the need to have a clear perception of what is at stake in a region politically no less inflammable than the raw material which provides the world with most of the energy it needs.The Iraqi aggression represents a clear violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter. Furthermore  if an irresponsible  aggressive Power succeeds not only by annexation but also by intimidation and threats in deciding the policy of a region which contains 40 per cent of the world's energy resources this could have repercussions throughout the world in terms  inter alia  of employment  inflation and recession - repercussions which would affect most severely the weakest economies and thus the poorest countries of the world.Our response has been commensurate with our awareness of the gravity of the breach of international law.The combined opposition of so many countries  beginning with the Arab States  demonstrates the full extent of international protest and reinforces the moral and political authority of the United Nations at a time when there is an ever-growing awareness of the need for an institution of universal scope capable not only of laying down rules but also of ensuring that they are applied and of preventing intimidation  extortion and subjugation.The world order resulting from the watershed of 1989 and the ensuing redefinition of international relations is not in crisis but is confronted by a very serious challenge. The resolutions of the Security Council are a sign that the international community not only wants to lay down certain rules but also has the means to enforce them. The cold war is really over and with it has vanished the fear that a regional conflict might escalate into an East-West world confrontation. Hone of our predecessors could have counted on such a certainty.The decisions of the United Nations create the conditions for Iraq's withdrawal by dint of its strict embargo and the maintenance of a collective response. The sands of the desert and the constant passage of time must neither wear away the broad political and military coalition which has been built up nor undermine the unprecedented unity forged under the banner of the United Nations. Our solidarity is no less important than the validity of our motives we must not allow timidity  ambiguity or economic shortages to open a breach in our resolve. She European Community is strengthening its own internal cohesion and extending co-operation eastwards. It warmly welcomes German unification  which  early in October  will fulfil the legitimate aspiration that the German people have cherished for over 40 years. We consider German unification as a positive factor in the development of Europe as a whole and of the Community in particular. It is making all of Europe stronger and more secure  and it will give even greater weight to Community action.The Twelve are determined to achieve a first agreement in the negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe and a substantial package of new confidence- and security-building measures in time for the summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to be hold in Paris. The signing of a first treaty on conventional forces in Europe will be an essential element for a successful CSCE summit and will also permit negotiations on short-range nuclear forces. The Twelve will strive to ensure that the Paris summit will mark the end of the ideological and military confrontation in Europe and pave the way for building new conditions for peace and stability in Europe based on confidence and co-operation.We have never been under the illusion that Europe could turn in on itself  that the CSCE could imply a release from needs  tensions and conflicts arising outside Europe  that in our smug satisfaction with our peaceful existence we could ignore the problems of others and the role of the United Nations.This is demonstrated by the effective and timely response of the Community to the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. It is understandable that the Community should immediately be aware of the gravity of what has happened since Europe's recent history is full of lessons. Europe has learned that aggression must be nipped in the bud and that the victims are most often small  defenceless States. It takes note of the fact that Saddam Hussein justifies the annexation of Kuwait by claiming that Middle East borders resulting from previous periods are worth nothing. We cites a principle which is in total contradiction not only with the United Nations Charter but also with that principle - so fundamental for us  contained in the Helsinki Final Act - of respect for borders and of their possible modification only by peaceful means.The reaction of the Community was the most far-reaching and  perhaps  the swiftest in its history  The Twelve were the first to decide on sanctions. They put their political weight behind their own decisions and the decisions of others to deploy forces. They granted transit facilities and contributed to the adoption of decisions by the United Nations  which remains the fundamental reference point for our action. It is significant that the Community's action in respect of a crisis which has arisen outside the confines of our continent has been overwhelmingly approved by public opinion in Europe.If the European Community could do nothing but look inwards on itself  it would not have much of a future. However  it intends increasingly to play its role as a new political force with a sense of a long history  political farsightedness and economic might.This crisis has demonstrated the European Community’s ability to mobilize its structure to face an exceptional challenge  but at the same time it has provided an incentive to improve even further the capacity of the Twelve to act united on the world scene  a fact that constitutes a further guarantee of effectiveness for the United Nations. To that end  starting with the conferences to begin in Rome in mid-December on institutional reforms and economic and monetary union  the Twelve have decided to strengthen their common political dimension and to offer a still more effective partnership to others in a world ruled  until a short time ago  by a mutual balance of terror. To Maintain the general consensus on the sanctions  steadfast international solidarity will be necessary  the all appreciated the promptness with which certain countries increased their oil production to restore the energy balance and the way others  with equal swiftness  re-established the strategic balance in the region. The west  and first and foremost the Community  is ready to shoulder its part of the burden  material and otherwise  so that the embargo does not fail. After all  how can we build Europe and convert it to interdependence and the market economy if uncertainty continues to paralyse an area of vital interest to the whole continent? One need only think of the energy problems of the newly democratic countries of Eastern Europe.The implementation of the embargo entails great sacrifices for certain countries. In the framework of broader international action involving other industrialised countries and the main Arab oil producers  the European Community will offer those countries a contribution to cope with the most serious consequences of the crisis. At their meeting in Rome on 7 September the Foreign Ministers of the Community stated their willingness to support Jordan  Turkey and Egypt  the front-line States  and promised to consider the situation of other countries. We do not wish to abandon the poorest nations that are prepared to pay the heavy price of the sanctions.Collective solidarity must be directed first and foremost to the Arab world. Only with the letter's full assistance will the political  diplomatic and economic isolation of Iraq be effective. No voice has been raised among the Arab States to justify the Iraqi moves. The attempts to call a new holy war have fallen on deaf ears.Right from the outset of the crisis we have maintained the closest contacts with our main partners in the Arab countries and the Islamic world  and we shall continue to do so. The Community intends to speed up the implementation of the Co-operation Agreement and the negotiation on free trade with the Gulf States in the same spirit. We also intend to pursue the Euro-Arab dialogue with a meeting following up the one in Paris last December. The European Community considers it vital to continue to seek a political solution  thus avoiding imperilling by mistake · or lack of patience the new order emerging thanks to the newly acquired strength of the United Nations. With the contribution of various countries it has become possible to set up a strategic shield to prevent the conflict from spreading. We also appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convince Iraq to put an end to a unanimously condemned violation. The waiting game will be won by the side with the staunchest determination to stand by the decisions taken  be they political  economic or military. By strictly complying with the resolutions of the Security Council  end by strengthening them appropriately  the international community will undoubtedly come out as the winning side.In that respect  I should like to recall that the European Community and its member States have consistently advocated the adoption of measures aimed at extending control of the implementation of the embargo against Iraq to air traffic. They therefore welcome the resolution the Security Council may adopt today on this subject.However  the price of this broad consensus must not be ineffectiveness and the price of compromise must not be injustice. The region we are talking about is on the borders of Europe and we are all endeavouring to see that the option of a settlement wins through. This must not entail compromises that violate the basic principles contained in the resolutions of the United Nations.The search for a settlement can succeed only to the extent that we are steadfast in dissuading  and determined to isolate  Iraq. Only firmness can open the way to such a settlement and prevent the start of a devastating conflagration. Remarking on the Munich Conference  Winston Churchill observed bitterly that the democracies had chosen dishonour to avoid war and in the end they had both war and honour. The lesson is still true. Today too firmness and dissuasive action are necessary to force the aggressor to back down and to prevent an armed conflict. They are also necessary when a dictator tries to shield himself with innocent hostages to stay our hand.The Foreign Ministers of the Twelve pointed out clearly that each member State would consider all Community nationals detained in Iraq and Kuwait as its own citizens  and stated that they held the Iraqis individually responsible for their safety. Our intention was thereby to introduce an innovation into international practice that would not be without consequences. With the precedent of Nuremberg particularly in mind  we thus reinforced the idea of individual responsibility in international affairs.We must prepare ourselves for a siege  which could be lengthy  to achieve the objectives of forcing Iraq to withdraw to its own borders  obtaining the release of all the hostages and restoring Kuwait's independence.The consensus that has arisen in respect of this serious and dramatic act of aggression must provide an impetus for resolving other crises and must confirm our commitment to eliminate other political injustices and promote the economic well-being of the region.Saddam Hussein has brought his country to the brink of disaster after bleeding it white in eight years of war. He has ripped apart the fragile fraternity of the Arab world. He has made more difficult the search  which we must continue tenaciously  for a historic understanding between the Arabs and the West  between the Islamic and the Western worlds. However  the Middle East goes on in a desperately precarious state. One cannot put out one fire that has broken out  however threatening and serious it is  and let the other blaze away in the occupied territories and in Lebanon. The military units deployed in the Saudi Arabian desert and the warships patrolling the Gulf are an effective response  but they cannot replace a policy of reducing more general tensions and instability  h solution of the current crisis that is not followed up by the drafting of guidelines for future political and economic action in the Middle East could be letters drawn in the sand  soon to be blown away and forgotten.The European Community has been firm and consistent in its contribution to the search for a solution to the conflict in the Middle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). That is and continues to be our policy  unwavering in recognising that the solution lies in the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and in that of the State of Israel to exist within secure  guaranteed borders. Just as action was being stepped up to initiate dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians  and as the international community was becoming increasingly alarmed at the intolerable situation in the occupied territories  the Iraqi aggression took place and has delayed the search for a solution. The Community's policy nevertheless remains the same and it will not be diverted by the present crisis from the search for a just  lasting and comprehensive solution based on the aforementioned principles.Lebanon  until recently one of the most successful models of religious tolerance in the Middle East  continues to tear itself apart. The European Community considers that only the implementation of the Taif agreements can help in the process of national reconciliation.Over and above these present grave crises  the time has also come to begin reflecting on the introduction in the Middle East of a collective system capable of guaranteeing stability  security  economic and social development  and recognition of the rights of all peoples. In Helsinki Presidents Bush and Gorbachev raised the possibility of а new order of peace  a commitment to work together with the countries in the area end outside to develop regional-security structures and measures to encourage stability and peace.In other words  without wishing to transfer the model of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCB) - which has shown itself to be so effective in our continent - in toto across the Mediterranean  we consider that it would be worth endeavouring to introduce in that area principles and measures capable of reducing military imbalances  which are in general the prelude to other military adventures  curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  encouraging economic and social progress  and fostering the peaceful coexistence of different cultures and civilisations. The first test has shown that the new world order works positively  but the serious problem of a social and economic order that threaten international stability are far from being resolved  and in some cases are even more disturbing  they require the momentum that can gather only within the United Nations  since of all problems they are most universal in origin and most widespread.We are witnessing the war that ell countries  but nest especially certain Latin American States  are waging against drugs. This problem threatens our societies and our younger generations  and creates spontaneous solidarity between Governments. The history of mankind knows no other scourge that has so permeated all regions of the world - affecting rich and poor countries alike  and overwhelming both the wealthy and the underprivileged. The Community intends to step up international co-operation on this problem. It will assist in the joint strategy  under the aegis of the United Nations  to control drugs production  manufacturing and trafficking  as well as the use to which the profits are put  by involving the banking system. Demand reduction is a main objective of the European Community and its member States.In the same vein  the emergence of intolerant forms of religious fanaticism and the uncontrolled flows of migrants  which affect industrial societies  stem essentially from conditions that deprive a large proportion of mankind of tine cultural and material resources needed for a decent life. The problem off development will inevitably weigh increasingly on a world witnessing the disappearance of the most manifest and dangerous confrontation of the poet-war period.The Community intends neither to withdraw into its own well-being  which is based on openness to other economies  nor to reduce its commitment towards the countries in the third world on account of its co-operation with Eastern Europe. The Community will encourage regional integration  in particular within the framework of its reviewed Mediterranean policy. We are also convinced that it is for us to create a macro-economic context favourable to growth and development through enhanced devolution of resources  which  however  must go hand in hand with domestic policies capable of promoting  alongside State initiatives  not only individual initiative but also respect for human rights. No external assistance may  in fact  compensate for ineffective national policies  as has been shown by the experience of the last decade.Development and environmental protection appear increasingly to be a facet of the world's interdependence. We cannot expect four fifths of humanity to go on living in the present conditions and at the same time hope that this will not have intolerable repercussions on man's capacity to live in harmony with nature. We cannot worry about tropical forests and look on impassively as many countries come to grips with a debt that precludes any possibility of development. In this connection  the conclusions at which Mr. Bettino Craxi has arrived in the work with which he was entrusted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations provide many lessons. Many countries in the Community have already granted substantial reductions in debt  but this is not enough. The problem of the middle-income countries  particularly those facing severe economic-reconstruction programmes  must be tackled with special attention. Thought must be given to a now range of options in the framework of the Paris Club.The Community considers that the strengthening of the multilateral trade system provides the best guarantee of international equilibrium and of sustainable development. The successful conclusion  before the end of the year  of the Uruguay Sound is all the more important against the background of the present crisis. It is a unique opportunity to achieve balanced and substantial progress in all fields of the ongoing negotiations. The United Nations has granted legitimacy to an unprecedented joint intervention. It is henceforward possible to perceive coexistence no longer hampered by the shackles of the cold war. A form of world management  at least of the crises most likely to have destabilising effects  is taking shape. The consensus reached to counter the Iraqi aggression must be preserved to take up other challenges. The spirit of this approach is already being put to use in the possible settlement of other conflicts  such as that in Cambodia. The agreement between the opposing parties on a transitional administrative arrangement  an end to hostilities  and free and fair elections within the framework agreed by the five permanent members of the Security Council will have the political and material support of the Community.The opportunity must be seized to apply in full the principles of the Charter to the peaceful settlement of other unsolved problems  such as that of Cyprus. The principle of universality is of the utmost importance. For instance  the absence of the two Koreas is a vestige of the confrontation of yesteryear. We must prepare to welcome both  particularly as they wish to start off on a new footing in their mutual relations.The United Nations is the first major attempt to democratise the international system - that is to say  to apply to relations between sovereign States the principles on which the rule of law is based. Those principles  whose solemn rebirth Europe has witnessed in the last year  are now gaining ground in all societies. Other barriers are falling  with peace-bringing  innovative effects - beginning with that most odious barrier that has so far denied the majority of the population in South Africa their rights and dignity. The Community offers its support to all those  regardless of their colour  who are joining forces to build a new South Africa free of apartheid and of all other forms of discrimination. We are following this process very attentively  with a view to adjusting the Community’s stand with regard to its developments  and we shall continue to spare no effort to contribute to its successful conclusion.Nothing convinces us more than do the latest events of the role that the United Nation· is increasingly called upon to play in favour of justice and freedom. The European Community wishes to mobilise the growing cohesion between its members and the whole weight of its moral  political and economic force to support the United Nations with a view to achieving these objectives.I have so far expressed the views of the Community and its member States. Let me now conclude my intervention by adding a few remarks on behalf of my own country.One further lesson of this crisis and the conclusion that we draw from the end of the post-cold war period prompt us to reflect on the need to adjust the structure and the functioning of the United Nations to the new reality of the international scene.Is the past  the abuse of the exercise of the right of veto has too often paralysed the capacity of the United Nations to put an end to the gravest crises. Today  the outlines of a possible new scenario are emerging  with the United Nations as the focal point in a world at last free of the nightmare of a nuclear holocaust. This compels us  as well  to review the way the United Nations operates at a time not just no longer that of the immediate post-war period - and I am thinking  inter alia  of the reference to the status of the former enemy Powers - but no longer- even that of the cold war.Moreover  considering the progress so far achieved in European integration  thought should also be given  in my view  to institutional adjustments  within the United Nations  capable of granting a more visible role to an entity like the European Community  which Italy wants to see endowed with supranational structures for conducting foreign policy  in the interests of the United Nations and in the interests of peace in the world.

"75",3526,"JAM",45,1990,"﻿Sir  you are presiding over the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session  a time of momentous change and a crucial moment in history. In offering you warm and sincere congratulations  we are particularly pleased that someone with such skill and experience from an island nation that has played such an important part in international affairs is guiding our deliberations.I also wish to express Jamaica's profound gratitude to outgoing President Joseph Garba of Nigeria for his dynamic and resourceful contribution to the success of the forty-fourth session. The 12-month period that has elapsed since the start of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly has been a remarkable one in the history of the world and has witnessed a number of critical initiatives being taken by this Organisation.	The transformation of the political landscape of Eastern Europe is now almost complete  and the reunification of the German nation is an accomplished fact.In Central America the promise of free and fair elections in Nicaragua has been honourably fulfilled and the people of that country can now turn their attention to dealing with their admittedly formidable economic and social problems.In Panama there has been the restoration of a Government that: can claim the legitimacy of popular support  even though that restoration took place in circumstances which many of us could not condone.In Haiti there is renewed hope that before the end of this year the Haitian people will exercise their long-deferred right to select their Government through a process of free and fair elections. My country  Jamaica  in collaboration with our partners in the Caribbean Community (CABICOM)  has been assisting and stands ready to assist and to give what further help we can. Other Governments have also helped on a bilateral basis. However  more is needed and the government of Haiti has requested assistance from this Organisation by way of financial and other support. We strongly support that request  which we believe should elicit a positive and prompt response  and we urge that every effort be made to overcome whatever procedural obstacles may exist so that the modest assistance requested by the Government of Haiti can be put in place right away.In a number of other countries in this hemisphere  peaceful transfers of power have taken place and there is a refreshing absence of military dictatorships and the welcome presence of a growing spirit of co-operation among the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean  all of which augurs well for the future. The announcement by the President of the United States of a commitment to a far-reaching initiative designed to deal comprehensively and in a co-operative way with the grave economic and social problems of Latin America and the Caribbean opens up an exciting vista of positive challenges and opportunities.In respect of the situation in southern Africa  at its sixteenth special session  devoted to apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa  this General Assembly adopted by consensus a historic Declaration listing the measures required for establishing a climate conducive to negotiations.I am sure that we all note with satisfaction that the administration of President de Klerk has begun a process of positive change and that initial steps have been taken by the regime to improve the internal political atmosphere. These steps include the release of Nelson Mandela from prison  an occurrence of major political significance and importance; the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa (AMC)  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political organizations  and preliminary discussions with the AHC under the leadership of Mr. Mandela to establish the prerequisites for embarking on negotiations designed to achieve a peaceful end to the evil system of apartheid. Progress is being made in complying with the measures outlined in the Declaration adopted at the sixteenth special session and  indeed  the parties have now agreed in the Pretoria Minute of 6 August 1990 that the way is now open to proceed towards negotiation of a new Constitution.All of this is most welcome but  of course  despite the progress that has been made  the main pillars of apartheid still remain in place. As indicated by Mr. Nelson Mandela in his historic and moving address to the Special Committee against Apartheid on 22 June this year  sanctions should remain in force until clear and irrefutable evidence emerges of profound and irreversible change.Jamaica hopes that  despite the obstacles that exist within both the black and the white communities  the initial steps that have been taken will lead to the commencement %^ negotiations in earnest and will bring an end in peaceful fashion to the abominable system and practice of apartheid and to the establishment of a just  democratic and non-racial society in South Africa.On the continent of Asia we note with satisfaction that important  though admittedly still limited  steps are being taken to end the division of the Korean peninsula  which represents one of the few remaining legacies of the cold war. The United Nations  the whole international community and those individual countries with strong bilateral ties with North and South Korea should do everything possible to assist in the successful evolution of that process.This past year has also witnessed a number of important initiatives that have been launched by the Organisation in areas of universal concern.The seventeenth special session of the General Assembly  on the subject of drugs  which was held earlier this year  provided an opportunity for countries to state clearly their commitment to take co-ordinated action to combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking and culminated in the adoption of a Political Declaration and Global Progress of Action. We have for some time now recognized the need to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations structure for drug abuse control. Therefore  Jamaica was very pleased to have had the opportunity to be represented on the Group of Experts which had been mandated to assist the Secretary-General in examining the modalities for more effective action within the United Nations system.The recommendations of that Expert Group are now before the Secretary-General for consideration. We anticipate the very early conclusion of deliberations on the matter and the proper establishment of an integrated structure through which Member States can more effectively co-ordinate their efforts on all aspects of the drug problem.In coping with the global phenomenon of drugs  it is becoming increasingly evident that demand reduction is a key element and that this is an essential part of any serious drug eradication programme. We therefore express special satisfaction at the growing international recognition of the importance of drug demand reduction as a means of controlling both production and abuse. We of course participated fully in the World Ministerial Summit to Reduce Demand for Drugs and to Combat the Cocaine Threat  which was held in the United Kingdom in April this year  and we note with satisfaction the successful outcomes of the meeting.In the area of economic co-operation  a fresh  although admittedly modest start  was made at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  which adopted by consensus a Declaration on International Economic Co-operation  in particular the Revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries. We must now seek to build on this consensus. We hope that international economic co-operation will be further stimulated by current events in view of the need to overcoat the negative effects of the crisis in the Gulf  particularly on oil-importing developing countries already staggering under a burden of debt and numerous other problems. It is widely acknowledged that the consensus reached at the special session was an important first step in the economic cooperation that the international community has to undertake in the process of carrying cut the agreed commitments and policies. These commitments and policies must of course in the first instance be implemented at the national level. Many developing countries including my own country  are in fact already endeavouring to implement policies aimed at keeping control over inflationary tendencies promoting domestic savings achieving favourable conditions for domestic and foreign investments  modernising the economy and increasing international competitiveness. However  the success of those policies will depend crucially on the support of the international community in areas such as enlarged market access; transfer of resources and above all a durable and broad solution of the external debt problems of the developing countries.On the critical issue of external debt  we welcomed the Secretary-General's appointment of the distinguished statesman Bettino Craxi to examine the current debt question in all its aspects. We trust that his several recommendations which include debt-servicing forgiveness the conversion of interest payments into indexed local currency funds to finance development projects  the strengthening of regional banks  and debt-equity swaps  will be fully discussed both nationally and internationally and that some workable consensus on the way forward will be found. In particular we continue to insist that mechanism must be devised to deal with the special situation of those countries  like ay own  that find themselves in the position of being net transfers of resources to the multilateral lending institutions.The World Summit for Children held here last weekend provided a timely opportunity to focus international attention on the pressing questions related to the protection and development of the world's children. The countries participating in the Summit demonstrated a high degree of political solidarity in agreeing to а number of comprehensive policies and strategies designed to ensure the future well-being  survival and growth of children all over the world. The government of Jamaica has already made children a priority in its recently developed ""Five-Year National Development Plan"" and will continue to seek ways and find the resources to fulfil its commitment to these important goals.Those positive developments on the political scene and the initiatives undertaken in relation to international co-operation in respect of narcotic trafficking  economic development and social concern might well have led us at this session of the General Assembly to look with optimism towards the continuing evolution of a more peaceful  harmonious  humane and caring international environment in which the struggle for a world order based on social justice and individual freedom could proceed with confidence. Unfortunately  any such optimism has been severely dampened by the crisis in the Persian Gulf region brought on by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. This act of totally unjustified aggression has rightly been condemned by virtually the entire world community of nations and has rightly been met with an uncompromising demand for unconditional withdrawal of the invading forces  and sanctions have rightly been visited on the aggressor.Most international disputes  and even some unilateral acts of aggression  when dispassionately examined will usually be found to contain elements of moral ambiguity or legal doubt. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq is an exception to this general experience. It is an act of naked  unrelieved aggression without any semblance of conceivable justification or excuse. Kuwait did not present any conceivable threat to the security of Iraq  nor was there any call from elements within the country for relief or assistance against an oppressive or illegal Government. It is a sovereign State and a Member of this Organisation that has been recognised as such by all other Members  including Iraq. In these circumstances  for the United Nations to fail to take action or to settle for anything less than the withdrawal of the invading forces  so as to permit the Kuwaiti people to continue to decide their own destiny  would be to condemn this Organisation for ever to impotence and futility.The attempt will undoubtedly be made  as indeed to some extent it has been made  to portray the impasse in the Gulf region as a confrontation between the United States and Iraq. It is important for everyone to recognize that  while the United States inevitably has the responsibility of playing a leading role  what is really involved is a confrontation between Iraq and the United Nations. Neither is the issue at stake one that is important only because the region is a major producer of oil. The principle involved is one of fundamental importance to every country  particularly to those developing countries which do not have the military strength to defend themselves against aggression or a take-over by more powerful neighbours. For such countries the only hope of lasting security lies in the unequivocal acceptance by the international community of the sanctity of a sovereign nation's right to determine its own destiny and the willingness of the nation States that constitute this Organisation to enforce that principle on their behalf. What is at stake  therefore  is the fundamental basis on which a peaceful and secure world order must rest.My country joins with the overwhelming majority of all mankind in its unequivocal support of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the actions that have been taken pursuant thereto. We do so in the full realisation of the severe economic hardships that have befallen and will continue to befall non-oil-producing developing countries like ours as c result of the dramatic escalation of oil prices that has taken place over the past two months. We are not  of course  the only sufferers. Nor is our plight the most dramatic. That melancholic distinction belongs to the people of Kuwait  to neighbouring countries whose trade has been devastated and security threatened  and to the tens of thousands of refugees whose livelihood  and in many cases basic possessions  have been lost overnight  Urgent help must continue to be mobilised on their behalf. Nevertheless  the drastic inflation of oil prices will  if continued much longer  affect the entire world economy. The developed industrialised countries will suffer some decline in growth rates  but  as happened in 1973 and 1979  they have room for manoeuvre to take defensive action and to cushion themselves against the worst effects. Few  if any  such options are open to the oil-importing developing countries  already burdened with debt and just beginning to emerge from a decade of painful adjustment which was  in large measure  brought on by the oil-price shocks of 1973 and 1979. Such countries are hit a double blow. The first immediate damage is caused by the pre-emption of scarce foreign exchange to meet the increased cost of importing the oil necessary to keep their production machines going and satisfy their basic needs for electricity and transportation. The second blow comes from the reduction of world trade due to the defensive deflationary and conservation measures taken by the developed industrialised nations  which will reduce the demand for their exports and further depress the prices of most of the other commodities on which they rely for export earnings. It should be noted  moreover  that for the oil-producing developing countries the short-term gains is likely to prove  as experience has shown  both illusory and dangerous. The defence mechanisms of contraction and conservation adopted by their main customers sooner or later produce the inevitable effect of a fall in oil prices every bit as precipitous as the artificially induced escalation. The fact is that the permanent interests of the oil-producing countries too are best served by a stable and orderly market in which prices move in a predictable way and in conformity with the requirements of growing and expanding world trade and a secure world economy.We urge the industrialised nations  the international financial institutions and the oil-producing countries to decide on and implement without delay an emergency programme to assist non-oil-producing developing countries  whose economies are facing disastrous stresses  not nest year or in the long run but right now. To many such countries  assistance delayed is tantamount to assistance denied. We strongly support the view  expressed by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  that the United Nations should take the lead in promoting and co-ordinating such a programme and should do so as a matter of extreme urgency.Already we have seen some welcome evidence of both an acceptance of the need for action and the willingness to take it. In this regard  we applaud the decision of the Government of Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production and the offer by Mexico and Venezuela to introduce temporary modifications in the San Jose Accord which will assist in providing some relief to the countries of Central America and the Caribbean. The decision by the United States to release some of its strategic reserves is also most welcome. The Soviet Union  the largest oil producer in the world  has expressed its willingness to co-operate in a global programme of action. At the recently concluded meeting of the Board of Governors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  the need for those institutions to provide some immediate financial relief  particularly to the poorest and most indebted countries  was also explicitly recognized.Clearly  therefore  the will exists. What is needed now is effective and co-ordinated action. Let us hope that it comes soon.However  even as we grapple with the immediate economic effects of the present crisis  we must begin to direct our minds to the more fundamental and long-term issue of world energy supplies.Given the present structure of the world economy and the existing state of technology  there is no escaping the fact that oil is a unique commodity - unique in the sense that its availability and cost play a decisive role in the orderly functioning of the world economy and  therefore  of the prospects for a world order of peace  stability and economic growth that will make possible a better life for all mankind.In the light of this  the world community must ask itself whether the availability and cost of this commodity can continue to be left to the vagaries of an unregulated market that has shown itself to be so easily destabilized.Moreover  one cannot escape the suspicion that it is a market which in a time of crisis or uncertainty is readily susceptible to manipulation. I say this because the present escalation of oil prices does not reflect either a corresponding and proportionate shortage of actual supply or an increased demand. It is speculative and artificial. The day will eventually come when the technology of alternative sources of energy has developed to the point where oil is no longer a unique commodity  but that day is still some distance away. In the meanwhile  is it acceptable for the world economy to remain in continued danger of the roller-coaster ride in oil prices which we witnessed in the recent past and which now threatens us again? It has been said that those who forget history are condemned to repeat it. He cannot afford to miss once again  as we did in the 1970s  the opportunity to establish a mechanism which would enable both the oil producers and the oil consumers to enjoy the benefits of a stable market in this commodity. By this I mean a market which will be fair to both producers and consumers  a market which will move in an orderly and predictable way as the world economy and world trade develop and which will  as far as practicable  be insulated from the effects of random political events and speculative manipulation.The establishment of such a mechanism will obviously require a high degree of agreement  co-operation and co-ordination on a global scale. It will be difficult and will not be accomplished overnight. Nevertheless  I suggest that this is a task which the Organisation  representing as it does all the nations and peoples involved  needs to put on its agenda for urgent and serious consideration.The Secretary-General and his staff continue to do a remarkable job  for which they deserve not only our profound gratitude but our unstinting support as they tackle the formidable agenda that lies ahead. My country pledges such support and reaffirms its commitment to this great Organization  which more than ever today is the repository and guarantor of our hopes for a world of peace  security and justice."
"76",3572,"JOR",45,1990,"﻿It is a source of pleasure to see you  Sir  presiding over the General Assembly at its current session. Your election to this high office  which you so rightly deserve  reflects the great esteem in which your friendly country and you personally are held. It is also an indication of confidence in your ability to conduct the business of this session with the efficiency and wisdom that will ensure its success.I am also delighted to express our gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  on his outstanding efficiency and ability in conducting the business of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.I would also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on his efforts and unceasing endeavours in the service of the cause of peace. In this respect  I would mention his valuable report on the work of the Organization  which last year  under his leadership  achieved important accomplishments in many regions and on various levels. We look forward to continued co-operation with the Secretary-General and to offering all that we can to enhance his ability to carry out his noble tasks.Over the past few decades  my country continued to face regional circumstances of extreme complexity that were on the whole the result of the international situation that emerged after the First World War. While those circumstances have placed heavy burdens on us  a small country  they did not prevent the establishment of the philosophy of government in Jordan on solid foundations that are compatible with our national  religious and cultural heritage  our openness towards the rest of humanity and our interaction with it in a world whose continuity and progress can be guaranteed only by international legitimacy.In 1945  together with lx other Arab States  Jordan established the League of Arab States  which was the first regional organization to precede the establishment of the United Nations  to whose lofty principles we have always adhered. Jordan has acted with the utmost moderation and realism when dealing with the various crises  issues and currents witnessed by our region. This is in keeping with the nature of Jordan's makeup as a nation that upholds the supremacy of law and democratic participation. Despite the regional turbulence all round it  Jordan has succeeded in building & society characterised by openness  that is constantly developing in an atmosphere of tolerance and calm dialogue. The Jordanian people have participated in the process of construction through their responsible exercise of democracy which was disrupted only by the circumstances that emerged following the war of June 1967. Now following the decision of Jordan to sever its legal and administrative ties with the occupied West Bank  in conformity with Palestinian and Arab wishes. Parliament has resumed its work in an atmosphere of openness and full democracy. We are determined to safeguard sad develop this democracy until it reaches a high level of maturity  takes root and embraces every facet of life in our society.This development took place at a time of universal and distinctive turning towards democracy as exemplified by the recent transformations in Eastern Europe which came as an expression of the yearning of the various nations in that region for the enjoyment of their freedom and to march forward in the process of social and economic development of their countries. While we look forward to the success of our democratic experiment  we hope that the climate of freedom and popular participation will be enhanced throughout the world to encompass all States and peoples who yearn to exercise their right to be free from pressure  dependence and hegemony. The successive crises experienced by the Middle East region over the past decades  have hindered the development of this vital part of the world  despite the abundance of wealth therein. This has engendered a feeling of frustration and bitterness among the region's people. The failure to find comprehensive and lasting solutions to those crises has created a state of constant tension in the area accompanied by a general psychological climate characterised by the feeling of grievance and of being targeted. This has seriously aggravated the socio-economic complexities of the situation in the region.Indeed  the entire region has become a fertile soil for all sorts of extremism. If we are to come to grips with such a situation our first priority should be the recognition of the right of the region's peoples to a life of freedom and dignity. This in turn requires that earnest efforts be made towards the creation of a suitable climate based on the comprehensiveness and universality of human rights and on the adherence to international legitimacy as enshrined by the Charter of the United Nations and its resolutions.Despite the injustice and the frustration suffered by the peoples of the Middle East region  they remain all the more anxious to enhance the role of the United Nations and to strengthen it in all spheres  especially where that role is concerned with peace-making and peace-keeping.The end of the cold war has engendered the hope that the absence of rivalry between the super-Powers would lead to focusing all efforts on working within the framework of the United Nations. However  there are indications that certain Powers may tend to deal with the recent positive developments with a sense of victory and see in those developments room for increasing their own gains by attempting to impose their will on other States. While our region and its peoples have paid a heavy price for the rivalry between the super-Powers during the cold war  they look forward to seeing the end of the cold war lead to putting an end to polarisation once and for all and completely eliminating all attempts at hegemony and exploitation in a way that should spread the benefits of international detente to all of humanity and would lead to the supremacy of the principles of law  justice and equality in this world.Nowadays  our region and the entire world live in a state of extreme tension as a result of the crisis in the Gulf. Jordan has called for and worked towards the settlement of this crisis in a way that conforms to the principles of the League of Arab States and halt the continuing drift towards a military explosion which threatens the security of the region  puts it face to face with certain catastrophe and endangers international peace and security in the process.Out of his sense of the danger besetting the region and its peoples  His Majesty King Hussein - from the very outset of the crisis - has made and continues to make  together with other Arab leaders  sincere and strenuous efforts in search of a peaceful solution to this crisis.Jordan  as a civilised country that respects its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations  does not and cannot approve of the resort to force as a way of solving differences between States  nor does it accept the occupation of the territory of others  nor does it support or recognize any demographic or political changes resulting from war in our area or anywhere else in the world. Therefore  Jordan did not recognise the decision to annex Kuwait. Jordan has called and continues to call for the restoration of legitimacy in this Arab country through withdrawal there from and followed by finding a permanent solution to the differences between Iraq and Kuwait within an Arab context.It is regrettable that the efforts made to solve the crisis at its beginning  within its regional context  have not been given sufficient opportunity and support. Some have even tried to thwart those efforts  which led to a quick worsening of the situation in a way that brought about a mutual escalation. That escalation  in turn  increased the rigidity of positions and put the whole region face to face with very bleak prospects. Now  several weeks after the breakout of the crisis  we are all the more convinced that a solution will come only through sincere and serious efforts by the Arab States - efforts which should be given international support and backing in order to avoid a tragedy whose effects will not be confined to one party alone.This does not mean that we see a contradiction between what we and other Arab States and others are calling for - namely  that the settlement should be found within a Pan-Arab context - and the efforts that nay be made by the international community - of which we are a part - in a United Nations context and in accordance with its Charter. We believe that those two efforts should complement and facilitate one another.The fact that we live in the Middle East region makes us more sensitive to the dangers inherent in an explosion of the situation there in view of the weapons of mass destruction that exist in the region  whether in the hands of regional parties or those that were brought in with the huge foreign military build-up which has continued since the start of the crisis. This constitutes an additional incentive not to spare any effort in trying to save the peoples of the region and their future generations from the dangers of an armed conflict  which  if it were to take place  would acquire unpredictable and unimaginable dimensions.We hope that everybody will appreciate that we have not taken our position on this crisis and its dangerous ramifications in order to please one party or another. We took our position in keeping with our principles and our determination to safeguard the security and safety of the countries and the peoples of the region. In this context we cannot but express our astonishment at the nervous reactions - of which we hear and whose effects we feel - to our principled stand  which rejects the occupation of the territory of others by force  while at the same time we continue to Work towards a peaceful and honourable solution to this crisis. We are directly affected by the many negative consequences of this crisis in a way that does not make it possible for us either to ignore it or look at it with indifference. Our commitment to the Security Council and its resolution  is a matter dictated by our adherence· to the Charter. We cannot do that selectively or seasonally. Jordan has declared its adherence to the recent resolutions of the Security Council on the crisis. Hence our implementation of the Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iraq in spite of its devastating effects on our national economy which threaten Jordan now and in the future in all walks of life.We were the first State to request consultations with the Security Council regarding the particular economic difficulties which will arise as a result of our compliance with Security Council resolution 661 (1990) in accordance with Article 50 of the Charter. It is unfortunate that there are some who want to use this as a means to exercise pressure on us and compel us to support positions and policies that we believe will bring destruction to the region.We hope that the international community will appreciate the major difficulties that our economy faces as a result of the crisis. In addition to the burdens resulting from our compliance with Security Council resolution 661 (1990)  we have started to suffer deteriorating conditions as a result of humanitarian problems that beset Jordanians working in Kuwait and other places who have lost all of their belongings and are returning home in great numbers.Jordan also faces the influx of hundreds of thousands of persons of other nationalities coming from Iraq and Kuwait. Helping these vast numbers of people creates very heavy burdens which our economy cannot withstand. It is regrettable that all this happens at a time when we face a situation very similar to a state of siege Jordan  in the face of the crisis and its overall effects has no choice but to continue making efforts together with Arab and other States to prevent a military confrontation and prepare the ground for creating a climate conducive to reaching a permanent solution to the crisis that will guarantee the interests of all parties and enable the  to shoulder their responsibilities towards the region and its resources  which we recognise as Swing important to human civilisation  in such a way as to ensure the achievement and maintenance of peace in the region  free from all formulae and pretexts for foreign presence. We emphasise that sincere  objective and unbiased Arab participation must be an integral part of any solution offered by the United Nations for this crisis  because we firmly believe that any solution imposed from outside the region will have no chance of success whatsoever.As for the other side of the Middle East region  despite the passing of 23 years since its adoption by the Security Council  another resolution  namely resolution 242 (1967)  remains un-implemented. Israel  to this very day  continues to occupy the territories fro  which the Security Council demanded that it should withdraw. The Palestinian people continue to live under a most brutal kind of colonialism  despite numerous resolutions adopted by the Security Council condemning various aspects of that colonialism - from the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights  to the establishment of settlements on Palestinian territories and other acts of oppression  including the deportation of Palestinians from their land  as part of a scheme designed to vacate the land of its people - none of those resolutions has found its way to implementation. Israel has found friends willing not only to help it is not implementing the resolutions of the Security Council  but also in hindering the Security Council's work and paralysing its ability to take decisions on the subject  thus making it difficult for the Council merely to convene  if only to discuss the situation in the occupied territories.This encouraged Israel to persist in its colonialist plans  the themes and contents of which are no longer championed by extremist or marginal groups  but have become the officially declared policy of the Israeli Government. The policy guidelines that constitute the platform of the present Government in Israel  as announced this past June  that state:""the eternal right of the Jewish people in Erts Israel is not subject to question. It is intertwined with its right to peace and security"".Bearing in mind that the definition of the so-called Eretz Israel includes at least the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967  it becomes clear that Israel has thus negated the very foundation on which all the peace efforts of the past two decades were based  namely  the formula for exchanging the occupied territories for peace.Israel has also seen in the recent international developments an opportunity to effect a sweeping and definitive demographic change in the occupied territories by limiting the options open to Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union and ensuring that their only destination would be Israel  in preparation for resettling them in the occupied territories when conditions become propitious. It should also be recalled that Israel’s Prime Minister  Yitshak Shamir  has already declared that: ""immigration is a big matter which requires the existence of a big Israel"". While recognising that the freedom to emigrate from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European States was the result of informal developments in those societies  on· should not  however  fail to address the tremendous pressures and continuous efforts exerted by Israel and its supporters to ensure that all emigrants go to Israel which regards them as a major tool in carrying out its expansionist schemes.Thus  while w· welcome the recent positive developments in the Soviet Union and the l-East European States  we are of the view that making the Palestinian people bear the consequences of that immigration to their land is another historic injustice to them  which is even in contravention of the very texts and instruments on which the right to immigration is based particularly in the Helsinki Final Act and the agreements pertaining thereto  which include the right o£ a person to leave his country and return to it. Therefore  it is only logical that the Palestinians should question the legitimacy of the immigration of citizens of other States to their land  when they are being expelled from that very lend and never allowed to return. In the absence of a peaceful  comprehensive and durable solution to the question of Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict  the continuation of this immigration constitutes a violation of the rights of the Palestinian people to their national homeland and a threat to the national security of neighbouring States. Ultimately  it will encourage the ruling circles in Israel to rid the occupied territories of their indigenous inhabitants and replace them with the large numbers of immigrants  particularly since the limited natural resources of the area could severely limit its capacity to absorb those immigrants  thus increasing the possibility of an Israeli plan of mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland.Ever since their national tragedy began  the Palestinian people have shown that it is impossible for them to abandon their legitimate rights. The Palestinian people have continued to confront the repressive Israeli machinery with endless sacrifices in order to achieve their goal of self-determination and national independence on their soil  like all other peoples. Their struggle reached a peak in the past three years  through their continuing popular uprising  the intifadah against the Israeli occupation which  in dealing with the intifadah. unmasked the real face of Israel and laid bare its unfounded claims to democracy and respect for human rights. The Palestinian people have also proved that the logic of might and the desire for expansion dominate Israeli thinking  which still regards the Intifadah as a matter of security  rather than a political issue representing the revolt of a people aspiring after independence  a people with whom Israel must come to terms in order to find an appropriate political settlement. Against this backdrop  Israeli occupation constitutes an anomaly  indeed  an anachronism  in this era which is witnessing the end of colonialism in a budding atmosphere of freedom and democracy. It is regrettable that the peace process in the Middle East should have come to a complete standstill even before the crisis in the Gulf began  and that Israel and its supporters are counting on the continuation of this crisis in the Gulf to enable them to reap certain benefits  foremost among which is a retreat from the search for a peaceful solution to the question of Palestine. It is noteworthy  however  that Israel and its supporters are the parties that are most enthusiastic for a military showdown and call for that showdown as a means of ending the Gulf crisis.That crisis has revealed the dangers that may result from a continued deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. These are dangers with far-reaching  devastating effects that transcend the boundaries of the region. Accordingly  there is today  more than ever before  a need for implementing Security Council resolutions. Those resolutions constitute the legal and political basis for any peaceful settlement in the region. The world is nearly unanimous in declaring that the appropriate means to achieve such a settlement  in an honourable and lasting manner  is through an international peace conference in which all the parties to the conflict  as well as the five permanent members of the Security Council would participate  especially since the state of international détente has presumably removed this idea from the sphere of rivalry between the super-Powers.Recent developments have demonstrated that peace will not prevail in this world simply by ending the rivalry between the super-Powers and by establishing detente between them. They have also demonstrated that unresolved crises do not automatically disappear with the passage of time. Rather  they tend to be aggravated and become more complex. The same developments also show that using double or contradictory political  legal and moral standards does not serve the cause of justice and peace in this world. What our region needs most today is a single standard governing relations between its States under the umbrella o£ international legitimacy  free from selectivity  in order to bring the movement of this region into harmony  rather than in contradiction with  positive developments in our world. In this context  we view the proposals of His Excellency President François Mitterrand of France  made in his speech from this podium two days ago  and the Soviet proposal to hold a conference for peace in the area as ideas which deserve careful consideration. We in Jordan shall  as always  remain totally ready to co-operate with the United Nations and with our friends in working for a peaceful solution to the problems of the region  so that its States and peoples may  after all their suffering  enjoy living in freedom and dignity  be able to determine their future and contribute  on the basis of equality and partnership  to forming a new world order  so that peace and justice may go hand in hand  since neither can prevail without the other.

"77",3619,"JPN",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Government and the people of Japan  I would first like to express my congratulations to Mr. Guido de Marco on his election as President of this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. At the same time  I would be remiss were I not to express our appreciation to Mr. Joseph Garba for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the forty-fourth session. I would also like to extend a hearty welcome to the Republic of Namibia and the Principality of Liechtenstein  both of which are joining us at the General Assembly as now Members of the United Nations.Established for the paramount purpose of maintaining international peace  the United Nations has once again become the focus of international attention and hope  as it has moved promptly and appropriately to deal with the recent Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  to work for peace in Cambodia and to fulfil its other missions. I sincerely welcome the revitalization of the United Nations role in maintaining and restoring peace  and express my profound appreciation and respect to the Security Council  the Secretary-General and the entire United Nations staff for their contributions to that end.Since we last gathered in these halls one year ago  the international situation has undergone changes far greater than any of us could have imagined. We are now truly at a historic watershed. In the light of perestroika and the ""new thinking"" that guides the foreign policy of the Soviet Union  democratization and the shift to market economies in Eastern Europe and the advent of a new era in United States-Soviet relations  the cold war is now a thing of the past. The transformation from discord and conflict to dialogue and co-operation that began in Europe has extended to other regions as well  and now shows signs of spreading world-wide. The collapse of the Berlin Wall and German unification are symbolic of this quantum leap to freedom and co-operation. However  despite the laudable historic changes  the sudden shattering of peace in the Gulf region with Iraq's illegal invasion of Kuwait is a reminder that the future of the international community remains uncertain and a demonstration that even this new international order is fraught with peril. In this rapidly changing international situation  what are the international community’s ultimate needs end what role can the United Nations play in meeting them? These are crucial issues  and our response to them will help determine whether we shall succeed in ensuring that this new world order is one of peace and 5u8tice.In taking a series of prompt and effective measures against Iraqi aggression  the Security Council became the embodiment of the international community's conscience and underlined the vital role the United Nations has to play. The collective security mechanism of the United Nations is based on а solemn pledge: States will resolve their differences peacefully through discussion  and meet with united opposition any State that breaks these vows. While in the era of East-West discord this system did not always work as effectively as we might have hoped  it may be said that a new era has dawned in which it could come into full flower. Terrorism and regional disputes grounded in ancient territorial or ethnic rivalries are the main destabilising elements at this time of transition  and it is essential that the United Nations play a central role in their prevention  elimination and resolution.The wave of democratisation spawned by reform and free elections in the countries of Eastern Europe gives us hope that a veritable tide of democratization will overtake Africa  Asia and Latin America  and that a current of reform will spread across the entire world. Market principles likewise are being embraced in more and more countries around the world. All people  regardless of where they live  must be guaranteed their fundamental human rights  must enjoy freedom of expression and have the right to pursue economic activities freely. The concept of each person realising his or her full potential is crucial to the attainment of a truly just and humane world based on respect and equality. I believe that the World Summit for Children  to be convened this week-end  will be meaningful in raising awareness of the issue of the rights of the world's children.By dispatching election observer teams to monitor free elections in diverse parts of the world  the United Nations has contributed immensely to this tide of democratization and  under the banner of ""ballots not bullets""  has proclaimed the gospel of self-determination  which holds that a nation’s future is determined by the will of its people. I am confident that the United Nations will play an increasingly important role in ensuring basic human rights and economic freedom. Although in the post-war era much of the free world has enjoyed development and prosperity  many developing countries are still beset by grinding poverty and crippling debt. If the international community is to achieve sustained growth we must strive to ensure that developing countries share in it. There are also numerous problems - such as those relating to the global environment and drugs - that affect all humankind and thus demand a common response. Because it is clearly impossible for any one country alone to resolve these issues  co-operation through the United Nations system is essential.Since the Second World War Japan has developed a foreign policy whose object  above all else  is peace and  in line with its Peace Constitution  has restricted its military activities entirely to defence  seeking to resolve differences with other nations through discussion. The spirit underlying Japan's Constitution is based on the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes that is embodied in the United Nations Charter. Thus  ever since being admitted to membership  Japan has made the United Nations an extremely important part of its foreign policy. Japan is firmly resolved not to become a military Power that could pose a threat to other nations  steadfastly to uphold its three non-nuclear principles  not to export arms to belligerents or countries on the brink of belligerency  and to contribute to world stability through peaceful means.Based on the position that it will discharge those international obligations it deems most appropriate  and in view of its dual position as an Asia-Pacific nation and an industrial democracy  Japan will seek to contribute to a better world and to pursue an activist foreign policy in the guest for peace and stability throughout the international community.Addressing the General Assembly last year  I stated that Japan would co-operate to the best of its ability in the cause of world peace - through diplomatic efforts  financial and personnel support for United Nations peace-keeping operations  and assistance for refugees and for national rehabilitation following the resolution of conflicts. Along with continuing to promote such co-operation in the cause of peace  Japan is determined to make broad-based contributions to those most urgent issues facing the international community: world-wide peace  stability  and democracy.Accordingly  Japan is prepared to co-operate in every possible way within the bounds of its Constitution so that the United Nations collective-security mechanism can function effectively. Responding to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq  Japan had independently decided to impose economic sanctions even before the Security Council took such action  and it is faithfully observing all the terms of the Security Council resolutions. Seeking to contribute vigorously to international efforts for the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf region  Japan has responded positively to the call for material  transport  medical and financial support.Japan is also extending assistance to the many refugees this conflict has generated  and economic support to the countries in the region most severely affected. Japan calls upon Iraq to heed the repeated Security Council resolutions and to withdraw promptly and unconditionally from Kuwait. The Iraqi measures barring the departure of many Japanese and ether foreign nationals stranded in Iraq are intolerable from a humanitarian as well as an international legal standpoint. Japan demands that the Government of Iraq allow these people to leave as soon as possible. I hope the Secretary-General will continue his efforts towards that end.The peace-keeping activities of the United Nations have taken on added breadth and intensity in recent years. I am particularly pleased that the areas of possible civilian participation have expanded  allowing a greater number of countries to become involved. I refer  in particular  to civilian monitoring of elections and the incorporation of a civil administrative function  as envisaged for the operations in Cambodia and Western Sahara. The United Nations is thus participating in the establishment of democratic governments  representing the best interests of the entire international community Japan has been making a special effort to support peace-keeping operations  including voluntary contributions to their start-up costs and also to a trust fund for strengthening their financial base. I should like to call upon other Member States to do likewise. Japan has also provided civilian personnel for the election observer teams in Namibia and Nicaragua  and I assure the Assembly that it will continue to extend both financial and personnel support for these activities.In an effort further to expand Japan's participation. Prime Minister Kaifu announced that he would review the legal system of Japan and seriously consider enacting new legislation - for example  a United Nations peace co-operation law. This would enable Japan within the framework of its Constitution to assume greater responsibilities regarding United Nations activities for preserving peace and to participate in international efforts in support of those activities. Indeed  the Government is now engaged in intensive deliberations on this legislation. I believe that Japan can best contribute to the cause of world peace  and in a manner consistent with its Peace Constitution  by participating in United Nations activities to restore and maintain international peace and stability.Tumultuous changes witnessed in Europe are spreading to other regions and have begun to have a global impact. In the Asia-Pacific region they include improvements in Sino-Soviet and in Korean-Soviet relations  the start of the Soviet withdrawal from Mongolia and Cam Ranh Bay  and the process of democratisation in Mongolia. These changes will surely be followed by others. At the same time  however  the Soviet Union continues to occupy Japan's Northern Territories  stability has yet to come to the Korean peninsula  and many problems stand in the way of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia. Moreover  there are fears that conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir may escalate. Peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region has a direct bearing on Japan's own stability  and I feel it is essential to work together to dispel the political distrust and solve other problems in the region. Accordingly£ it is Japan's policy  as part of its diplomatic efforts  to encourage more vigorous and constructive dialogue among all countries concerned.In this era when new relationships  based on dialogue and co-operation  are being forged worldwide  I am hopeful that progress will be made towards normalizing Japanese-Soviet relations  resolving the still unsettled Northern Territories issue  and concluding a peace treaty between our two countries. Progress in these areas not only will contribute immeasurably to buttressing peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region but also will help extend to other parts of the world the substantive improvements in the East-West relationship that are taking place in Europe. It is on this basis that Japan will continue further to expand and strengthen the dialogue; I hope that the Soviet Union will likewise make greater efforts for fundamental improvements in the relationship.It is crucial to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region that the People's Republic of China remains open to the rest of the world and enjoy domestic stability. Japan hopes that China will continue to pursue policies of reform and openness  and  for its part  will continue its policy of extending all possible co-operation to such Chinese efforts at modernisation. A comprehensive political settlement in which the United Nations is involved is essential to any lasting solution to the long-festering Cambodian problem. Following last year's international conference in Paris  efforts for a political settlement have been made  at the international level  at the regional level  and at the national level  among the principal parties. An Asian nation itself  Japan hosted the Tokyo meeting on Cambodia in an effort to find a solution to this problem  which is the primary destabilizing factor in the region  and has taken an active part in the peace process.The momentum for peace is building  with the formulation of a framework for a settlement by the permanent members of the Security Council  and with the establishment  at the Jakarta meeting  of the Supreme National Council. I very much hope that the Paris conference will be convened soon  that the remaining problems will be ironed out  and that peace will come to Cambodia in the near future. Japan is considering how it might extend co-operation with United Nations peace-keeping activities and  once peace is attained  with national rehabilitation efforts.The issue of the Korean peninsula is  as a matter of principle  one to be settled peacefully through direct dialogue between the authorities of the North and of the South. Highly appreciative of the fact that the historic North-South Prime-Ministerial meeting took place earlier this month in Seoul  Japan hopes that further progress will be made in the North-South dialogue. In the light of this new situation  Japan is working positively to improve relations with North Korea  with due regard for the maintenance of international political balance. Japan hopes to contribute to the creation of a climate conducive to further dialogue between North and South Korea. Moreover  we have maintained the position that we would welcome and support United Nations membership for North and South  as an interim measure towards the goal of unification of the peninsula. This would also contribute to the relaxation of tensions and would enhance the universality of the United Nations. We hope that constructive talks will be hold between North and South on the basis of the outcome of the recent North-South Prime-Ministerial meeting.I place the greatest importance on the progress made recently in South Africa towards the elimination of apartheid. Preliminary negotiations between the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress have prepared the way for true negotiations on the drafting of a new constitution  and I believe that this represents a significant step towards a peaceful resolution of the problem. Japan supports the efforts of all the principals involved in South Africa towards the establishment of a free and democratic regime  a regime from which apartheid has been fully eradicated.We must not forget that  even today  internal fighting continues in Afghanistan. Japan has long emphasized that true stability cannot be attained in Afghanistan without the establishment of α broad-based Government that reflects the popular will. Japan has been working actively for refugee repatriation - for example  by contributing to the Office of the Co-ordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance to Afghanistan. I sincerely hope that  through the determined efforts of the Afghan people themselves to solve their problems  and through the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union  peace and stability will be restored to Afghanistan and that refugees will be enabled to return to their homes as soon as possible.Japan has consistently supported the efforts and initiatives of countries in the region to restore peace to Central America. We attach the greatest importance to the fact that a change of Government was effected in Nicaragua through free and fair elections held under United Nations supervision  and we hope that in El Salvador a cease-fire will be achieved with United Nations co-operation. In the field of arms control and disarmament  it is gratifying that the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and the Negotiations on Conventional Forces in Europe have been accelerated. This progress both reflects and reinforces the overall improvement in East-West relations.Yet of ever greater urgency is the question of how to structure  maintain and strengthen global arrangements against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  as well as of missiles and other armaments. The current situation in this Gulf vividly demonstrates this. I am convinced that Japan's firm policy of restricting the export of weapons has contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security. Believing it imperative that there be greater disclosure and greater transparency in the transfer of conventional weapons  I very much hope that a productive conclusion can be reached on this issue in the deliberations by the group of experts  as called for in the General Assembly resolution.While the recently concluded Fourth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) did not adopt a final declaration  it did reaffirm the significance of the NPT structure. Japan will continue to work for the maintenance and strengthening of the HPT regime  and calls upon all of the signatories strictly to observe the Treaty's provisions. We believe that having France and China present as observers at this Fourth Review Conference was beneficial in that it made the NPT regime more universal  and we appeal to all countries  nuclear and non-nuclear alike  to accede to the Treaty as soon as possible  if they have not already done so. In the same vein  Japan was pleased that this year at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament the ad hoc committee was reconvened to deliberate on substantive issues relating to the limiting or banning of nuclear testing. That the United States and the Soviet Union have exchanged instruments of ratification for two treaties relating to nuclear testing is also encouraging  and we hope that this work will be continued next year.If we are ever to achieve a fundamental solution to the issue of chemical weapons  it is essential that we make further efforts  in the spirit of the Final Declaration of the Paris Conference  to achieve an early conclusion by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament on a comprehensive ban on these weapons. The initiatives taken recently by the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue deserve our highest respect.Japan  for its part  will continue to work At the United Nations  at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  and in other forums  for effective arms control and disarmament. As an industrial democracy  Japan is contributing vigorously to the movement towards democracy manifest in so many places around the world. Japan's basic policy is to co-operate actively  as appropriate to each situation  with countries that are themselves undertaking democratisation.In co-ordination with the other industrial democracies  Japan will continue to support actively the democratic Governments that have been established in Eastern Europe.I believe that it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate our support  through economic and other forms of co-operation  for the democratisation efforts of developing countries by extending economic and other forms of co-operation. As is clear from the efforts for perestroika in the Soviet Union and from the shift to Market economies in Eastern Europe  the driving force behind the world economy's dynamic development has been the system of free trade centred on market-economy principles.Moreover  it is hoped that the integration of the European Community  slated for 1992  will not succumb to regionalism and protectionism  but will be open to the rest of the world. It is essential that the free-trade system be preserved and strengthened in order to ensure sustained development everywhere  including East European and developing countries. Accordingly  our most urgent task is to ensure that the Uruguay Bound is concluded successfully  stemming the tide of protectionism and restructuring the international trading order for the twenty-first century. With little more than two months to go in the negotiations  it is essential that every Government concerned have the political will to make a concerted effort to resolve the remaining issues. The effort to support the East European countries in their transition to market economies must not adversely affect assistance to developing countries. This position was reaffirmed in the Economic Declaration of the Houston Summit. Support for developing countries  particularly non-oil-producing countries  is especially important in view of the effects that the current situation in the Gulf is having on them. Thu   we must recognize that the need to co-operate with the developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America as they strive to overcome their economic difficulties is greater than ever. Japan has systematically enhanced its official development assistance (ODA) in an effort to expand the flow of capital and technical co-operation to developing countries. As a result  last year Japan became the world's largest donor of ODA. At the same time  it is working to implement measures to recycle private and public funds on an untied basis to developing countries burdened by debt and other problems.The land-locked developing countries (LLDCs) of sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere demand particular consideration as they struggle with declining market prices for their primary commodities  low-growth rates  trade deficits  burgeoning debt  and other grave difficulties. Japan has been strengthening its support for the economic structural adjustment efforts of these countries by extending non-project grant capital co-operation as well as grant assistance to offset obligations arising from past yen credits. The recent ŁŁDC Paris Conference played an important role in bringing to world attention the desperate plight of the LLDCs and the need for international co-operation. Japan intends to extend assistance to these countries to the best of its ability.As Japan's ODA disbursements have increased  making it the world's leading donor country  I have frequently been asked if this assistance is truly designed to meet actual needs of the recipient countries  if due attention is being paid to environmental concerns in development projects  and if the assistance is being used effectively. I hope that the system for assessing the effectiveness of aid will be improved and the dialogue on aid policies and programmes between donor and recipient countries strengthened. The United Nations  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  and other international bodies play the leading role here  and I suggest that they strengthen all possible measures to achieve these ends.	. The dramatic political and economic changes which the international community is now witnessing are closely related to dramatic advances in science and technology. Ever since the invention of the steam engine gave rise to the industrial revolution and irrevocably altered the social structure  scientific innovation has affected the way society has developed. Today  advances in telecommunications satellites have made it possible to exchange information and images in real time  and advances in transportation technology have enabled us to travel more frequently and at faster speeds. Indeed  the instantaneous transmission of information was a major factor behind the chain reaction of rapid  radical reform in Eastern Europe. Scientific and technological advances offer infinite possibilities for human progress.The other side of this coin  however  is the alarming progress made in weapons technology with its potential for the total destruction of human society. And the vast increases in production and consumption that have accompanied scientific and technological advances have in turn given rise to the problems of global warming  destruction of the ozone layer  depletion of the tropical rain forests  acid rain  creeping desertification  and other disruptions of the global ecological balance.Because these issues are of the most urgent importance to the entire global community  it is incumbent upon the United Nations  humankind's most universal organisation  to mobilize all of the capabilities available to it in the search for solutions.Japan's assiduous efforts to overcome its serious environmental pollution problems have resulted  for example  in the achievement of the lowest carbon dioxide emission levels relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) of any industrial nation. I assure the Assembly that Japan will use its scientific and technological expertise  experience and wisdom  as well as its economic might  to contribute  ever more vigorously to international co-operation on global environmental issues. Consistent with the policy  and with its continuing support for the activities of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) and other bodies  Japan is increasing its ODA for environmental programmes to approximately 300 billion yen over the three-year period from 1989 to 1991. Japan is also taking an active part in preparations for the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  and will extend co-operation to support developing countries  through  for example  the Multilateral Fund under the Montreal Protocol.The transfer of technology is an important part of assistance to developing countries  a study is now under way on the possibility of establishing in Japan the UMEP centre for global environmental conservation. This would serve as a central body to co-ordinate the collection of technical data to meet the needs of developing countries and provide access to appropriate technology through training and other programmes. As soon as UMBP makes а formal decision  the Government of Japan will co-operate with efforts to establish thin centre.The 1990s have been designated the International Decade for natural Disaster Seduction. As one of the countries that proposed this designation  Japan appeals to all countries of the world to make every effort to raise international consciousness about natural disasters  to minimise the damage from such disasters  and to protect the global environment.It is in the field of medicine in which we have most directly experienced the benefits of science and technology  and it is clear that international co-operation in this field is most important if we are to go on to create a global community in which all people can live full and healthy lives. Through advances in medicine  tuberculosis  smallpox  and many other once-feared diseases have been largely eradicated. It is hoped that in the not-too-distant future effective means will be found to treat cancer and AIDS.The accident at Chernobyl was a stark reminder of the potential of scientific and technological advances to threaten humankind's very survival. This year the Economic and Social Council has called for bilateral and Multilateral assistance to the victims of that tragic accident. As the only country to have suffered the effects of the atomic bomb  Japan intends to use the experience it has gained in this field to benefit those victims.The drug problem is another issue that can only be resolved with international co-operation  and here too hopes are high that the United Nations will play an effective role. Japan supports the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UMFOAC) and is working to implement the global action programme and political Declaration adopted at the special session on narcotic drugs. Consistent with these efforts  Japan has proposed that an Asia-Pacific drug conference be convened to promote and co-ordinate intraregional co-operation on this issue.In this era of change it is important that serious thought be given to the question whether the roles and functions of the United Nations are fully suited to the emerging international order. The Security Council  for example  has an increasingly important role to play in this age of dialogue and co-operation in maintaining and restoring peace; even before conflict erupts  it should  together with the Secretary-General  engage in preventive diplomacy to warn of the danger and to lower the level of tension. I believe that a system should be put in place which  in a situation where international peace and security was threatened  would enable the Security Council to conduct fact-finding activities and dispatch  observer missions and the Secretary-General to undertake efforts to intervene  and prevent conflict at an early stage. Such a system would constitute a particularly effective means of preventing the escalation of disputes. Japan is prepared to work in earnest with other Member States to take the necessary measures to strengthen these conflict-prevention functions.All Member States should take full part in United Nations activities  working as equals in this new era of co-operation. Consistent with this principle  I believe that the so-called former enemy clauses remaining in the Charter are entirely inappropriate and meaningless in this new era  and I should like to call upon other United Nations Members for their understanding and support for the elimination of these clauses. The speedy response of the United Nations to the Iraqi crisis has opened the eyes of leaders and people the world over to the usefulness of the United Nations and especially of its efforts to maintain and restore peace. In Japan  the media offer detailed reports of every Security Council meeting and thorough analyses of the Secretary-General's every diplomatic move   t the same time  there is an earnest public debate now under way as to how Japan  a pacifist nation  can more fully co-operate with the United Nations to achieve world peace. I trust that similar debates are taking place in other nations around the globe.However before have hopes been higher that the United Nations will play a leading role in the pursuit of world peace and stability; in the creation of a free and democratic society  where human rights are respected; in the achievement of lasting prosperity; and in solving the environmental and other global problems facing humankind.We are now in the final decade of the twentieth century and  as we look back  it is clear that this was a century of protracted war and conflict. It should be just as clear that the twenty-first century must be one of peace and co-operation.All nations will have to co-operate to preserve the global environment  control drug abuse  deter international terrorism and prevent the depletion of the Earth's resources.Having made the United Nations a central focus of its foreign policy ever since being accepted as a Member  Japan places its full trust and hope in the Organisation. Japan is determined to make every possible effort for world peace and stability for a humane international community and for an enduringly beautiful planet."
"78",3691,"KEN",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the President of the Republic of Kenya  the Honourable Daniel Arap Moi  allow me to convey to Mr. Guido de Marco Kenya's warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Kenya is confident that his wide experience will steer the session to a successful conclusion of its deliberations on complex issues of critical importance to the international community. I wish him a successful presidency.I wish also to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  for the manner in which he conducted the affairs of the Assembly at its forty-fourth session.My country's sincere appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continued search for peaceful solutions to the seemingly intractable problems of the world. We should also like to talk  this opportunity to congratulate the new Member State of Liechtenstein and to welcome it to the United Nations.The achievement of independence by Namibia in March this year was a historic event. The freeing of a people from decades of subjugation and discrimination was a testimony to the eventual triumph of good over evil. It was proof of what we have been saying for years that if the international community is genuinely serious about resolving conflicts  then concerted international action can and will rid the world of most of its evils. Kenya is proud to have made a contribution to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group  and we are fully committed to co-operating with Namibia in the years to come. The past year also witnessed yet another significant contribution of the	United Nations in a conflict-resolution situation. I have in mind the role of the United Nations in Central America  and particularly in Nicaragua with regard to the successful ratification of the electoral process. We are confident that with the support of all Member States the United Nations involvement in the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict will be similarly successful.Four months ago in this Hall the Secretary-General welcomed a great man long involved in the struggle against apartheids a man whose presence he described as a landmark in the United Nations. The Secretary-General aptly stated that Mr. Nelson Mandela was a symbol of the unconquerable spirit of the people of South Africa and a champion of freedom and justice for all. Kenya joined the international community in applauding the release of Mr. Mandela after he had languished for 27 years in South African jails.We have over the years sought to portray the indescribable evil of the system of apartheid  but on this occasion I shall quote Mr. Mandela  who said of apartheid ""It has established its own brutal worth by the number of children it has killed and the orphans  widows and widowers it can claim as its unique creation."" fA M 960. annex VI. p. 103). I wish also to remind the Assembly of those other words spoken by Mr. Mandela. We said: ""It will forever remain an indelible blight on human history that the apartheid crime ever occurred. Future generations will surely ask: what error was made that this system established itself in the wake of the adoption of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights?""It will forever remain an accusation and a challenge to all men and women of conscience that it took as long as it has before all of us stood up to say enough is enough."" (ibid.) While there can be no denying that there have been some positive developments within South Africa  Kenya nevertheless maintains that those developments are a tentative beginning to the long process ahead. The pillars of apartheid have not yet been completely dismantled  and black South Africans continue to be deprived of their rights  their freedom and their lives. Thus  while we commend President De Klerk for the steps he has taken  we remain committed to the total eradication of apartheid. We reiterate our full support for the maintenance of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa until meaningful changes have been accepted by the majority of South Africans. We also confirm our support for the Declaration on South Africa adopted at the sixteenth special session of the General Assembly. We urge all nations to abide by its call for the non-relaxation of existing measures aimed at encouraging the South African Government to eradicate apartheid until there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible change in South Africa.The Middle East has been s region of rising tension and confrontations for a long time. However  the situation has recently been exacerbated by the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq. That invasion has been condemned by the international community  including Kenya. My country  while complying with the United Nations Security Council resolutions on the crisis  urges that no effort be spared in the search for a peaceful solution to the problem. We certainly cannot allow the acquisition of territory by use of force by any State. The Middle East has seen little progress  and Kenya continues to be concerned over the unstable situation in the region. At the core of the problem remains the question of Palestine  and we are deeply concerned at the continued deterioration in the conditions of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We appeal to Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967 and express our regret that all attempts to alleviate the situation have been rejected. Kenya supports a just and lasting settlement to the Palestinian question based on the relevant United Nations resolutions. We believe that the rights off the Palestinian people  including their right to a homeland  must be realised  as well as the rights o£ all States in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure borders. We remain convinced of the importance of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties on an equal footing  and we hope that such a conference would take place in the very near future.Kenya welcomes all attempts to achieve peace and stability in South-East Asia  particularly through a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem. We continue to maintain our position on the right of the people of Cambodia to determine their own destiny free from any outside interference  and we support the current United Nations initiatives aimed at bringing a cease-fire and free and fair elections under United Nations supervision.In the Korean peninsula we are heartened by the continued dialogue between the two Koreas. Recent positive developments augur well for a peaceful reunification of the two countries to the mutual benefit of all the Korean people. However  should either of the Koreas wish to be admitted to the United Nations Kenya would support such an application. We believe that the unification issue should not be used as a basis for denying the wish of either of the Koreas to become a Member of our Organisation.With regard to the question of Cyprus  Kenya regrets the lack of progress made in the inter-communal talks under the sponsorship of the Secretary-General. It is our hope that there will be a speedy withdrawal of all foreign troops and settlers from Cyprus and that all States will respect the independence of that Island nation. It is my country's belief that disarmament is a moral imperative of the international community if the basic objectives of maintaining international peace and security are to be achieved. It is on that premise that we welcomed the successful bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in Washington DC  in May 1990. The two super-Powers have signed various accords which include  inter alia  important commitments to cut stockpiles of their long-range nuclear arms and  of particular significance  an agreement to reduce by 30 per cent their stockpiles of nuclear missiles. The long-range nuclear-force agreement - although bumble  like the earlier Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  in the number of weapons it seeks to eliminate - is of great political significance  especially for many non-nuclear States that advocate a comprehensive nuclear-test ban.My country  Kenya  views the question of a nuclear-weapon test ban as one of paramount importance. In our view a comprehensive test ban is the only viable way to stop the technological momentum of the nuclear-arms race and is one appropriate tool for practical arms-control policies geared to preventing further escalation in the qualitative-arms competition. It is in view of that that my delegation looks forward to the forthcoming amendment conference of the partial test-ban Treaty in 1991.With regard to the question of verification Kenya does not share the view that this is an obstacle to the conclusion of β comprehensive test-ban treaty. Verification is an integral part of arms-limitation and disarmament agreements  which must be verifiable in the interest of security and compliance. Although it is a complicated issue  the history of negotiated agreements is on our side. It tells us that when negotiating parties were firmly determined to reach an agreement they were always able to remove all obstacles pertaining to verification measures. The Secretary-General's government expert study group  of which Kenya was a member  has done a very commendable job in this area  and we hope that the General Assembly will adopt the Group's recommendations  thereby enhancing the United Nations’ role in verification.For decades African States have demonstrated their commitment to the cause of the denuclearisation of their continent as espoused by the Cairo Declaration of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1964. Kenya continues to attach particular importance to the establishment of zones of peace in various parts of the world. Such zones of peace would not only strengthen the fabric of regional peace and stability but would also extend extra-regional co-operation in the field of socio-economic development. In light of this  the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace reflects the hopes and aspirations of my country as a littoral State to enhance and share in the prospects of peace and security. We therefore strongly support the proposal to convene the United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace at Colombo  Sri Lanka  in 1991. It is our sincere belief that that Conference will not only harmonize the interests of the countries in the region but also those of the major naval Powers and maritime users. Thus we commend the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean for the good work it has done in the preparation of the Conference despite the many obstacles it has faced. Before I comment on the international economic situation I should like to speak briefly on the Horn of Africa - my region - and the law of the sea. In the context of regional co-operation tremendous results have been achieved by the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) in combating recurrent droughts and desertification  which are the major causes of widespread famine  environmental deterioration and economic hardships in our region. However  it is a matter of great significance that IGAAD has served to foster the spirit of regional co-operation and become an essential forum for taking stock of Africa's problems. It is a forum within which we are able to take stock of the problems impeding economic development in our region. It is in light of that fact that my country has always supported efforts by all parties involved in the search for peaceful solutions to regional conflicts  including intra-State wars  which lead to unnecessary loss of life and seriously hamper implementation of development objectives. Our region is endeavouring to resolve destructive conflicts and to ensure peace among the States members of IGAAD in order to facilitate a better climate for wider regional trade and economic ties  which are a prerequisite for economic integration.In this regard the Foreign Ministers of the six States members of the Authority met at Nairobi towards the end of August 1990 to elaborate on the implementation of the Declaration on peace  stability and development adopted by their Heads of State and Government on 9 July 1990 at Addis Ababa. That Declaration emphasises the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States members and the non-use or threat of use of force against each other  as well as the peaceful settlement of disputes. The States members of the Authority have committed themselves to the peaceful resolution of inter-State and intra-State conflicts and to co-operation in all fields of socio-economic development.Last year my Government joined the growing number of nations that have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Kenya believes that universal acceptance of that Convention will be the only way in which the whole world can reap the benefits offered by the comprehensive regime of the Convention. To that end Kenya continues to participate actively in the work of the Preparatory Commission in the belief that any issues on which nations may disagree can be solved within that forum in a spirit of compromise.  To give further legal effect to Kenya's ratification of the Convention on this Law of the Sea we passed in 1989 a Maritime Zone Act and a Fisheries Act. Those two Acts of Parliament will clarify Kenya's claim to its maritime economic zone and ensure proper conservation and management of our maritime resources.During the 1980s world economic growth was slow  highly imbalanced and uneven compared to the previous two decades of the 1970s and 1960s. World output grew by just over 30 per cent in the 1980s  more slowly than in the 1970s  when it increased by over 45 per cent and at a higher rate in the 1960s. That slow expansion of the global economy was characterised by great contrast in experiences and performance. While on the one hand it was a period in which the developed market economies witnessed the longest  uninterrupted growth and expansion since the Second World War  the majority of the developing countries  on the other hand  were faced with continued stagnation and declining economies. The 1980s was  for most developing countries  a decade of struggling under unyielding economic crisis  which seriously hindered progress towards the improvement of economic and social conditions resulting in increasing and widespread acute poverty. Yet the global economy experienced increasing interdependence  increasing population  increasing environmental concerns  increasing trade protectionism  increasing development and application of science and technology and increasing flows of financial resources.While the developments on the political scene have given mankind so much hope for peace in the future  there is an urgent need to translate that into a real and durable gift through improvement in the economic field in the 1990s.It was against that background that the developing countries took an initiative at the special session on economic co-operation held in April of this year to find ways and means of stimulating economic growth and development  particularly in the developing countries. The noble objective of improving the world economy for the benefit of all makes the Declaration that was unanimously adopted at that special session the basis for action in the 1990e. It is Kenya's position that the implementation of this important Declaration  in particular through the injection of political will by members of the international community  would constitute a significant step towards the developmental efforts of developing countries.In the recent past the world has witnessed major changes  some of them extraordinary  some dramatic. The scone of these changes has mainly been in the political arena  but their impact in the economic field is taking shape and will soon transform international economic relations among nations. Among these changes are those that have taken place in eastern European countries and the ongoing economic process of modernisation  together with the unprecedentedly quick response with regard to assistance from the industrialised countries. The debate held at the last summer session of the Economic and Social Council confirmed that those changes have a potential to move North-South co-operation to the periphery of international relations and worsen the already severe social conditions in developing countries. While developing countries welcome the changes in Eastern Europe  they are apprehensive that resources will be diverted to that region at the expense of the developing countries. It was reassuring  however  that developed countries reiterated their commitments to assist the South and said that they would not reduce the current financial resources. Since its emergence in 1982  the external debt crisis of developing countries has been the major obstacle to those countries' development efforts  their efforts to improve the welfare of their peoples  and has become a matter of serious concern to the international community. Despite the grave concerns that have been expressed  the many strategies discussed  and the various measures attempted so far  the crisis persists and continues to be one of the major obstacles to social and economic development in developing countries. The total debt of developing countries has been increasing  and now stands at the staggering figure of about $1.3 trillion  compared to $6 billion in 1980.The cost of debt-servicing has been growing rapidly as a result of the unjust rates of interest  which increased excessively in the 1980s and have not shown any signs of improvement. This problem has been exacerbated by a peculiar uneconomic phenomenon: that  from their desperately needed domestic income  the developing countries are now transferring more to creditors in developed countries than they receive from those creditors.It is noteworthy that various measures towards solving the debt crisis - measures such as the Toronto scheme  the Brady plan  the rescheduling of bilateral loons  the cancellation of some official development assistance (ODA) loans  and conversion debt-equity swaps - have been taken. These are welcome. It is  however  even more noteworthy that such measures have contributed to the control of only a very small proportion of the total debt of developing countries  that they have done little to reduce the overall burden of external indebtedness and its impact on economic growth and social conditions in developing countries. Recovery and the resumption of sustained growth in developing countries demand that immediate measures be agreed upon to end the debt problem. We therefore welcome the recently released report of Mr. Bettino Craxi  the Secretary-General's special adviser on debt  and we hope that his recommendations will help us to find lasting solutions to the debt problem. The creation of a multilateral trade system that is open  sustainable and just is essential to the expansion of a healthy world trade and to the efficient utilisation of available global resources. The current trends towards increasing unilateralism  protectionism and rivalry militate against stable growth in world trade. Zn particular  they create serious difficulties for the developing countries as those countries endeavour to fulfil their role in world trade  and thereby affect their development. There is therefore an urgent need to maintain an effective multilateral trading system that will safeguard the interests of all trading countries  including the smallest  by ensuring stability  predictability and transparency in the economic and trading environment. The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations is the most important event currently taking place in which this issue will have to be addressed. In this connection  we wish to stress the importance of an outcome that will make it possible to take account equitably of the interests of all participants. The threat to the environment presents challenges that need to be addressed without further delay. Combined with the growing world population and increasing poverty in developing countries  the threat to the environment overshadows the very future of the human race. While the environment is the common concern of all  the developed countries - which have the greatest capability in technology; which control the existing wasteful global production and consumption patterns; and which are the major source of pollution - have the main responsibility to take appropriate measures urgently. The opportunity for agreeing on appropriate measures - an opportunity presented by the preparatory process for the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and the Conference itself in Brazil in 1992 - should be taken seriously. Kenya  as in the past  will work towards the objective of a clean and sound environment for present and future generations.The revitalisation of development in the 1990s will require that the Unite:"" Nations play its unique role. The various processes that are under way - including the preparations for the Fourth United Nations International Development Decade  the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  UNCTAD VTII and others - present our Organization with an opportunity to contribute significantly to the solution of global problems  especially the acute problems facing developing countries. The Member States have a responsibility to enable the United Nations to perform its important role with increased effectiveness and productivity. Kenya will not be found wanting in this regard."
"79",3803,"KNA",45,1990,"I welcome this opportunity to extend to you  Sir  the congratulations of the delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis on your election to the eminent post of the President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth section. Your election is a clear reflection of the high esteem in which you are held and of the complete confidence placed in you by your colleagues. My delegation is particularly pleased to welcome you to this position as the representative of the fellow island nation  and pledges its fullest co-operation as you guide the critical deliberation of this body. I also express the hearty congratulations to the outgoing President of the General Assembly for the skilful guidance of the Assembly through the critical issues that commanded its attention during the last session.It is with a profound sense of admiration that I pay a tribute also to our distinguished Secretary-General  Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts to bring about resolution of the dangerous conflicts that beset the world community.On behalf of our delegation  I extend a warm welcome to the Organization's newest member state  Liechtenstein  which has supplanted Saint Kitts and Nevis as the smallest nation in the United Nations. This addition to our membership emphasizes that the United Nations is alive and provides the opportunity for all countries  great and small  to contribute to the making of a better world.I address the assembly just five days after the seventh anniversary of the independence of my country. My government  from the outset  established as its primary objective - raisan d'etre - the improvement of the quality of life of our people. In pursuit of this mission  we sat ourselves certain sectoral objectives  which included/l enhancement of the rate of economic growth; continuation of the our programme of economic diversification  and the general transformation of the structure of the economy so that the rate of economic growth might be stable and sustainable over the long term; containment of the rate of inflation; provision of increased employment opportunities for our people; satisfaction of the health  nutritional  educational  housing and other socio-cultural needs of our people; and provision and maintenance of adequate physical infrastructure for the convenience of the public at large  and to facilitate trade  industry  tourism and agricultural development. These are the objectives with which every member nation of the Assembly can identify and which they can readily support. They are objectives which every small developing country in the world would hold dear. Until recently the odds against a small developing country achieving sustained success in realising all of these basic and essential objectives were monumental. Until recently super-Power tensions and the arms race  regional conflicts  ideological divisions all conspired to divert the attention of the world away from the plight of the poor  and disadvantaged people everywhere. Then suddenly hope burst upon the world like a flower in Moon. The two super-powers -the United States and the Soviet Union - embraced  and the world breathed a sigh of relief. Freedom began bursting out all over  and in Latin America and in Eastern Europe democracy descended like rain upon a thirsty land. The Berlin Wall  like the wall of Jericho  came tumbling down; and Germany  so long divided  now stands upon the threshold of reunification  a beacon of hope for all divided people to follow. While the prospect of peace around the world would obviously be welcomed by all nations  amongst developing countries  and more so among island developing countries like Saint Kitts and Nevis  there was a special feeling of elation. We felt that at last the developed countries could be able to focus their attention seriously on the plight of the developing nations. We were of the view that small island developing countries could now be seen and appreciated as presenting difficult problems peculiar to their geographical status and that  at last  a universal effort could be focused on finding and implementing lasting solutions to these problems. This was the time for  the massive resources which hitherto were going into the production and proliferation of nuclear  conventional  chemical or bacterialweapons of destruction to be diverted on a grant scale into a new world war -a war on the production  trafficking and use of narcotic drugs  a war on atmospheric  marine and land-based pollution  a war on under-development  a war on disease  illiteracy  ignorance and  poverty. This should have been a global war waged under the banner of the United Nations  and with the full support of its entire membership. This was the time for nations to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into  pruning hooks. Once again the attention of the world community has been diverted by conflict. Once again we are brought face to face with the reality that conflicts and global tensions are the enemies of development The invasion and occupation of Kuwait   a member country of the United Nations  by Iraq is an illegal act of aggression. My Government joins in the worldwide condemnation of this illegal act and further supports the United Nations resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. We recommend that every effort be exploited to bring this crisis to a peaceful resolution. This crisis in the Gulf highlights again the vulnerability of small states.  We are not only at the mercy of the elements  but we face the risk of being swallowed up by larger end more powerful nations. Our only protection against this eventuality is either the military support of friendly neighbours or the indignation and punitive sanctions  of the international community. Our vulnerability is further demonstrated by the seriously adverse impact which this crisis in having on the economy of our country in that fuel prices have skyrocketed; the cost of generating electricity has escalated  significantly and  hence  the cost of pumping water from our wells has also risen  and inevitably  the cost of imports has risen  leading to a greater outflow of foreign exchange earnings  while at the same time assistance from the industrialised countries will no doubt be further decreased.I applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General to endeavour to find a peaceful solution and trust that he will succeed. In the light of the present crisis it almost seems pointless to seek to address all the issues of concern to my country as well as to other developing countries. It is difficult to avoid wondering if anyone in the developed countries would be 1istening at this time. However  the issue of development and the environment is so fundamental to the achievement of  our improved quality of life that I must address it and hope that my message will be heard.First  I wish to commend the activities of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  the World Health Organization (WHO)  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)  the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganisation (UNIDO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) as they continue to provide our countries with the desired technical assistance in such environmental development programmes as water-quality protection  water and sanitation  sustainable agriculture and aquaculture. I also wish to applaud the work of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which held its first session in Nairobi in August this year. I congratulate the Government and people of Kenya as the proud hosts of this symbolic first session. Saint Kitts and Nevis will follow the work of  the Committee and would wish to participate in the plans of action that derive from its work. My Government and people would greatly value the assistance and collaboration of UNESCO and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNSP) to promote environmental education and training for the 1990s in our schools and to incorporate environments1 literacy into our national strategies for educational advancement. It is clear that the world is more sensitive today to issues relating to the environment . This is the case to such on extent that many projects in developing countries are either delayed or denied because either the industrialised countries or the multilateral agencies have concerns about the impact of these projects on the environment. Philosophically  this may seem to be a reasonable approach. However  it must be viewed against the background that most  if not all  of the problems we worry about today are caused by the industrialized countries  which  in order to achieve their developmental objectives  place development first and the environment last  and sometimes nowhere at all. We hear about the greenhouse effect now because the industrialized countries have been cutting down their forests for decades. It is they who accumulate nuclear waste and toxic waste. It is they who have polluted rivers and seas. Some animal-rights groups will malign the good name of a whole nation of farmers whose crops are systematically destroyed by monkeys  leading to extreme frustration  loss of income  a depressed and disenchanted sector and depletion of foreign exchange. We must be rational in our approach to the environment. Sustained development and effective environmental protection must be complementary and not competitive. Linkages must be forged between industry and environmental protection to attain an improved quality of life. In short  the environment must not be used as a scapegoat or as an excuse further to stultify the aspirations of developing countries. Now that the industrialized countries have achieved outstanding levels of development  the environment notwithstanding  - and we all share the adverse effects - they should be prepared immediately to make additional resources available to developing countries for the protection of the environment  while ensuring that projects designed to achieve sustained and sustainable development can proceed.   In Saint Kitts and Nevis we place a high premium on the implementation of land-use policies that would enhance food production  ensure food security and improved nutrition  and thus improve health and industry. we are striving now to diversify our formerly monocultural economy. Tourism is an important part of that programme. It is clear that if our tourism industry is to grow and contribute meaningfully to the economy  then as island communities we must protect the seas and oceans which give life to our important marine resources and our coastal areas. The prevention and clean-up of ocean pollution  however  require international co-operation and the willingness of the  international community to respond quickly to calls for assistance. The whole issue of the environment is a major subject  which can be properly addressed by developing countries only with the assistance from the United Nations and also directly from the developed countries. Another area of grave concern in relation to our quality-of-life objective is the serious harm that illicit narcotic drugs can cause to this and succeeding generations of young people. Our determination as a nation to fight the menace of drugs remains strong and unswerving. We have tightened law enforcement and enacted l  stiffer penalties. We have benefited in a small measure from the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) in areas of law enforcement and training. Werequire more assistance in reducing demand through preventive education  health care and rehabilitation. There is a need for continued international co-operation to combat the cultivation and trafficking of these illicit substances  to eliminate the demand  to intensify efforts in the field of public information  health and education  and to develop programmes for rehabilitation. The drug traffickers  the narco-terrorists  must be stopped at all costs. They must no longer be allowed to terrorise the lives of our young people  threaten the security of the region  subvert our youth   rape our society and retard the future of generations. The global war against drugs must be declared during this forty-fifth session and all our Governments and peoples must enlist. Although the current tensions continue to dominate our consciousness  and indeed hang like a pall over our deliberations  we must not forget the progress that the Organisation has helped to make. I welcome a free Namibia into the family of the United Nations. I pay tribute to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)  which played a vital role in the Namibian electoral process  facilitating a fundamental improvement in Namibia's political climate  setting the stage for the reality of free end fair elections  and reflecting the commitment of the Namibian people to independence. The struggle was hard and long and the freedom of Namibia today is a tribute to the people of Namibia and to this family of nations. Even in South Africa a glimmer of hope has lit the scene. My Government and  people welcome with great joy the release of Nelson Mandela. We marvel at his remarkable fortitude and his eschewing of bitterness in spite of the enormity of his ordeal. Clearly Mandela's release  the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  and the start of the dialogue all represent encouraging signs that change may well be on the horizon in South Africa. We are saddened by the violence in the black townships  of South Africa. That may not  however  be taken as an excuse to maintain the status quo.  We in Saint Kitts and Nevis will not be  and we call upon all nations to not allow themselves to be  lulled into tacit acceptance of aparteid by token gestures of conciliation. Apartheid is an evil and abhorrent system which propounds the superiority of one man over another based upon the colour of his skin. There can be no compromise with apartheid. All men are created equal - that is a universal truth. It is only by the elimination of apartheid that South Africa can hope to re-enter the family of nations. My country  Saint Kitts and Nevis  while recognizing that progress has been made  calls for the maintenance of all sanctions against South Africa  of December 1989  and recommend that the international community continue to assists the South African people and support the front-line States. It is cause for deep concern that peace and justice continue to elude the people of Cambodia. The people of that war-torn country must be allowed to enjoy the right to self-determination without external interference.  We continue to demand that all foreign troops be removed from Cambodia and that any suchwithdrawal be verified and ensured by the  presence of an international Peacekeeping force. We call for dialogue between all parties in Cambodia tocontinue until a settlement is reached  and my Government is of the view that in the interim the status of Cambodia at the United Nations should not change. Closer to home in our Caribbean region we are deeply concerned about the unstable situation which continues to exist in Haiti. Clearly  political events have made it difficult for meaningful economic development to proceed. We in the region will continue to support all efforts to facilitate the holding of free and fair elections. I express the hope that the forces of influence inside and outside Haiti will do everything possible to help  and nothing to hinder  Haiti's transition to electoral democracy. Saint Kitts and Nevis applauds the attempts at rapprochement between North and South Korea. The world needs all the peace and conciliation it can find. We support the continuation of the dialogue between the two Korean Governments in the firm belief that it can lead to peace and reunification. My delegation reiterate its call for both countries on the Korean peninsula to become States members of the United Nations as a positive step to enhancing their dialogue towards reunification within the Organization's structured and sympathetic framework. The international community is so preoccupied at this time that the concerns and aspirations of small island nations may not occupy a position of prominence on its agenda. However  I must endeavour to keep the development concerns of this unique group of nations before the members of the Assembly. We are vulnerable to hurricanes  as demonstrated by the devastation suffered by Saint Kitts and Nevis from the winds of Hurricane Hugo. In this regard  I take this opportunity to express the eternal gratitude of the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the assistance which was rendered by States members and related institutions of this Organization. We are also very vulnerable to every fluctuation in economic parameters far removed from our shores  like the crisis in the Gulf. We are vulnerable to the adventurism or terrorists  like those who held the Prime Minister and Cabinet members of Trinidad and Tobago hostage in July this year. We in the Caribbean provided humanitarian assistance and we were prepared to supply military assistance if it was required. we are vulnerable to aid  sea and land pollution originating outside of our shores. The highest calling of the United Nations is to facilitate the peaceful development of all nations and to mobilise the community of nations to improve the quality of life of people everywhere. For this noble ideal to be realized  the  world must have peace. Let us stand firm against aggression  exploitation and suppression  so that peace may be won and the world can direct its attention and its massive resources to the development of people everywhere. There is no higher ideal to which the United Nations can aspire."
"80",3875,"KWT",45,1990,"﻿In the name of God  the Compassionate  the Merciful. As Muslims  we always begin everything by invoking the name of God  our Lord  and in praising the Lord we seek to draw closer to Him  Whom we praise even in times of distress.I offer you  Mr. President  in my own name and on behalf of the people of Kuwait  sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. You represent  Sir  a friendly country that has very close ties with Kuwait. Both our countries  as well as all other States  draw strength and effectiveness from the principles of justice and international law. We are confident  Mr. President  that under your stewardship  the Assembly will be able to fulfil the aspirations of the international community at this point in time against an extremely complex international backdrop.I wish also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Garba  for the skill and prudence he demonstrated in addressing the concerns of the world community.In the same vein  special thanks and gratitude go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar  for his persistent and outstanding efforts in the interest of international peace and security as well as his keen interest in enhancing the role and effectiveness of the world Organization with a view to attaining the noble goals set by the founding fathers.Since Liechtenstein has now joined the United Nations  it is our pleasure to extend a warm welcome to the new Member and to wish its friendly people every success in their new status. We trust that Liechtenstein's presence here will promote multilateralism in all its aspects.I speak from this rostrum today as my peaceful country is passing through extremely harsh circumstances that have given rise to an unprecedented crisis in the history of the United Nations  which  since its inception  has sought to uphold justice on the basis of international law. Indeed  the Security Council has demonstrated that role by recently adopting a series of firm resolutions in the face of naked and brutal aggression against the State of Kuwait. There is no doubt that the key role played by the Security Council is indeed a propitious one under the prevailing grave circumstances in Kuwait and  in fact  in the world at large. It is our earnest hope that this role will continue to grow without waning and gain momentum without setbacks in order to consolidate the rule of international law.Today  I bring to you the message of a peace-loving nation  a nation that has consistently worked for peace  a nation that reached out with a helping hand to all those who truly needed help  a nation that sought mediation and reconciliation among adversaries. It is this very nation whose security and stability have been trampled upon as a result of its abiding belief in the lofty principles inspired by our true Muslim faith and echoed in universal charters  pacts and codes of morality.Today  I plead before you the cause of a people whose land  until so recently  was a beacon for peaceful co-existence and genuine brotherhood among the family of nations  a people whose national territory was a gathering place for individuals from various peaceful nations who sought a decent and dignified life through constructive work. Some of these people have now been made homeless  wanderers living only on hope in their banishment  while others have become prisoners or fighters refusing  even at the risk of their own lives  to surrender or yield to occupation regardless of its violence and brutality.The crisis of Kuwait is a manifold tragedy  whose dire consequences affect not only Kuwaitis  but also other peoples. In fact  it has jeopardized stability in the world  especially in the Gulf region.And so  I come to this forum  which is the helm of international action  in order to acknowledge the overwhelming global solidarity that has been shown to us in a multitude of Security Council resolutions that have been passed in an unprecedented fashion. This demonstrates rock-solid international rejection of the assassination of the norms of international law  rules of good neighbourly relations and established customs and practices by armed military invaders  whose tanks rolled over and crushed all those concepts. Indeed  this is what makes the Iraqi aggression against the State of Kuwait quite a peculiar case  for we have never seen in contemporary  post-Second World War history a country that overran a sovereign independent State  a member of the United Nations  and then sought not only to annex it by brutal force  but also to erase its name and entire entity from the world political map and wipe out the parameters of its national identity as defined by its institutions and its political  economic and social structures. All of this has taken place as we approach the end of the twentieth century!I came here to tell you of the horrors and suffering we are enduring both inside and outside our occupied homeland  and to put before you our just case. Now  the fate of a people  of a nation  is in your hands. Expecting you to act in good conscience  we are confident that the only measure that will win your endorsement is support for our legitimate right to liberate our land. Furthermore  we trust that you will not waver in deciding on the measures needed to compel the invading aggressors to restore the legitimate authority and to put an end to their barbaric acts and deviations.The aggression by the Iraqi regime against the State of Kuwait  which resulted in occupation  and the vicious Iraqi attempts to annex Kuwait in flagrant violation of all charters  norms of conduct and treaties  including those legal instruments concluded between the two countries and deposited right here with the United Nations  is not an ordinary conflict between two States over a piece of land. Rather  the Iraqi aggression was the culmination of a pre-meditated scheme to occupy and seize the entire State by force of arms. This aggression  alas  was perpetrated by a country with which we had several internationally recognized treaties and agreements within the frameworks of the League of Arab States  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the United Nations and other international organizations.This Iraqi regime has invented false pretexts and untenable claims against my peaceful and peace-loving country. In response to them  and despite our firm conviction that those claims were totally unfounded  we proposed the setting up of a mutually acceptable  neutral Arab arbitration panel  to which both parties would submit their differences. However  Iraq turned down that offer out of hand. Our last attempt at a peaceful resolution of our problems with Iraq was the bilateral round of talks in Jeddah  in our sister Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  in the course of which Kuwait stressed the need to resolve its outstanding problems with Iraq within an Arab context. But Iraq's plans were not anchored in any legal framework or based on any formal legal instruments. In fact  Iraq was bent on sweeping through the entire territory of Kuwait  violating its sovereignty and violating the sanctity of Kuwaiti citizens' lives and property. As a consequence  rape  destruction  terror and torture are now the rule of the day in the once peaceful and tranquil land of Kuwait. Hundreds of thousands of Kuwaiti citizens  along with the nationals of various other countries who were our guests  have been made homeless and many of them have had their life savings robbed. Hundreds have lost their lives. Others have been held hostage. Indeed  at this very moment  an intense campaign of terror  torture and humiliation continues unabated in that dear land. We receive daily reports of massacres and continuing systematic armed looting and destruction of State assets and individual property.This has prompted the forces of right  justice and peace in the world to try to acquaint themselves with the calamity of those innocents. In accordance with its responsibilities derived from the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  the International Committee of the Red Cross has attempted to dispatch a team that would have reported on their conditions. But the aggressor  persisting in its inhumane conduct  declined to allow this international committee to send representatives to Kuwait in order to carry out their tasks. It also refused to let envoys of the Secretary-General of the United Nations visit Kuwait to verify the conditions of its population.Such conduct constitutes yet another violation by the aggressor of international and humanitarian covenants  thus demanding a resolute stand against it.	.Against all these odds  an enormous source of solace to us has been the position taken by virtually all the countries of the world in support of Kuwait's rights. Hence  the League of Arab States  the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Islamic countries and the Security Council of the United Nations all took appropriate decisions condemning the Iraqi aggression and calling for the annulment of the annexation act and the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the invading Iraqi forces to the border that existed prior to the aggression. Thus  the legitimate Government of Kuwait would be able to exercise its functions and responsibilities as it used to before the invasion. It is with a deep sense of pride and honour that we hail the stand taken by the proud people of Kuwait in defence of the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of their State against the usurper  whose forces are armed to the teeth with weapons of destruction. Two years have now elapsed since I took an initiative from this rostrum calling for the cancellation of foreign debts under the burden of which numerous countries suffer enormously. In point of fact  those countries have fallen victim to a host of factors that not only thwarted any prospect for their economic prosperity but also generated mounting pressure on them. Though some measure of progress has indeed been made in this area  the magnitude and scope of the problem continue to pose a grave threat to the lives of millions of human beings  a threat that in all likelihood may undermine world peace and stability. The long-standing academic argument that economic stability and political stability are closely interlinked is perhaps as valid and timely now as it has ever been. Along these lines  it would be advisable for us all to review the conclusions of the United Nations-sponsored Conference on the Problems of the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris earlier this month  in order to appreciate better the weight of the problem and the urgency it has assumed with a view to making tangible headway towards an effective remedy in the interest of all mankind. In this spirit  Kuwait  for its part  has decided  in line with our previous proposal regarding this issue  to write off all interests on its loans. In addition  Kuwait will consider with the poorest nations arrangements regarding the principal of its loans with a view to easing the burden of their debts.From the early years of independence  my country has been privileged to be in the forefront of States that gave development aid to other countries. Kuwait's contributions represent the highest rate in the world in terms of gross national product  amounting to 8.3 per cent of its gross national product. This highlights Kuwait's genuine desire to contribute towards raising the standard of living in the developing nations. It also proves that Kuwait has been a leader in the efforts to improve the economic infrastructure of other countries. The devastating consequences of the aggression against Kuwait and its civilian population  with its repercussions on the stability and security of the entire Gulf region  together with its ripple effects on world stability  as we have clearly seen  have been far-reaching indeed. They have already had adverse effects on long-standing crucial issues we had always hoped the world community would eventually resolve satisfactorily. I have in mind the problem of the Palestinian people and the tragedy of the occupation of the southern part of our sister State  Lebanon.The State of Kuwait will remain  as always  faithful to its principles  true to its system of values  close to its friends and faithful of its obligations and commitments.In closing  may I take this opportunity to address a few words to my people  my kinsfolk  the loyal sons and daughters of Kuwait  from this forum  a forum for justice and fairness  a forum for guidance and hope  to assure each and every one of them that Allah  the Almighty  will ultimately secure triumph for us  thanks to their struggle and resolve  thanks to the gracious role of the United Nations  thanks to the support lent to us by our brethren and friends along with all people of good conscience throughout the world. The withdrawal of the invaders is  God willing  undoubtedly imminent. We shall return to our Kuwait  the oasis of safety and peace  which embraces all Kuwaitis and foreigners living in our midst as brothers. Together  we shall join hands in concert and harmony to secure our development and progress. This will be a fulfilment of God's promise as rendered in the following verse:""O ye who believe!If ye will aid (The cause of) Allah We will aid you.And plant your feet firmly."" (The Holy Koran. XLVII:7)And whose word can be truer than Allah's?Thank you and may Allah  our Lord  bring you all peace and grace."
"81",3921,"LAO",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  I should like to extend to you  Sir  my hearty congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-fifth session. I am confident that under your leadership  and with the assistance of all delegations  the work of the present session will be crowned with success. I should like to congratulate your predecessor  General Garba of Nigeria  who also successfully conducted the debates of the Assembly  at the forty-fourth session.In addition  I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his dedication to the task of safeguarding the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace and the settlement of conflicts in different parts of the world.The Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes the admission of the Principality of Liechtenstein as a full-fledged Member of our Organization and welcomes its delegation among us.The forty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when our world is experiencing important and rapid changes in relations between States and when there are new trends favourable to peace and international security. In the area of disarmament  although the danger of a nuclear war has not been entirely laid to rest  the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States have decided to reduce their strategic weapons by 30 per cent  as well as the agreement on the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles that they concluded earlier  constitutes a significant contribution to the lessening of the danger of such a war. In addition  the convergence of those two countries  views regarding the need to eliminate chemical weapons and halt production of such weapons is likely to give encouragement to the talks under way for the drafting of an international convention on the subject and to speed up its implementation once drafted.In the political area  the exchange of visits and regular meetings between Heads of State and high-ranking leaders of various countries have without doubt created conditions conducive to better mutual understanding and to the dispelling of mistrust.The joyous official reunification of Germany today  the efforts exerted by the Soviet Union and the United States to reduce their troops and armaments under the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation respectively and the adoption of collective confidence-building measures in Europe have all contributed to dissipating gradually the old climate of distrust.In general  my country  like the other countries of the world  desires only to see our world free of nuclear weapons in these last years of this century  to see mankind spared the horrible danger of chemical weapons and to be able at least to have our children and grandchildren live in lasting peace and in a society that respects the independence and sovereignty of others  heeds the right and the interests of others and maintains mutually advantageous bonds of co-operation.To achieve these aspirations I consider that it is time for the countries  possessing considerable military forces to begin serious negotiations to achieve general end complete disarmament under effective international control  disarmament that entails a genuine halting of the arms race including the arms race in outer space  and the limitation of conventional weapons.However  relations between States and groups of States have in some cases remained very confused. In certain regions military confrontations are striking features of the present situation that are capable of leading to grave catastrophes for mankind.In the Persian Gulf  the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq has created a very complex and confused situation that seriously threatens the peace and stability in that region and throughout the world. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is greatly concerned over this situation and feels that the adoption by the Security Council of various resolutions on this subject it highly appropriate action that should make it possible to ease the crisis and resolve it by political means. Of course  people the world over are concerned first and foremost by the situation thus created in the Persian Gulf  but we must not in any case lose sight of the question of Palestine and the situation in Lebanon  which also require speedy settlement. That could not but contribute greatly to promoting peace  stability and co-operation in that region.The question of Afghanistan is not yet completely resolved. The innocent population of Afghanistan  whether in urban centres or in the countryside  continues every day to be the victim of hostile forces. It is time for all the parties concerned to make efforts together to solve this problem by peaceful means  on the basis of the strict and complete implementation of the Geneva Agreement by the co-signatories and the guarantors of the Agreement. The situation in the Korean peninsula remains difficult and complicated despite the recent meeting between the Prise Ministers of the two parts of the country. The Lao government fully supports the initiative and the efforts of the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea aimed at that country  peaceful reunification free from any foreign interference.In South Africa  the release of Nelson Mandela is an important victory for the black population fighting for the complete abolition of apartheid and to make South Africa a united  democratic and non-racial country where the whole population can live in conditions of justice and security. Thus the international community should continue to apply the sanctions against the racist regime until it agrees once end for all to abolish its apartheid policy and decides to negotiate seriously with the African National Congress of South Africa.  In South-East Asia peaceful coexistence  the settlement of disputes by political means and economic co-operation are constantly growing stronger and developing. The countries of the region continue to consult together  both formally and informally  and spare no efforts to make that region an area of peace  independence  freedom and neutrality.The problem of Cambodia is one of the chief subjects occupying the attention of international public opinion. At present  everyone agrees that this problem must be resolved by political means. The process of the settlement of the Cambodian problem in moving forward constructively. The Tokyo Declaration of 5 June 1990 by Nr. Hun Sen  Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the State of Cambodia  and Prince Sihanouk is an important step in that process and has received full approval from world public opinion. The recent meeting at Jakarta among the different Cambodian parties and the subsequent Security Council resolution 668 (1990) have marked another no less important stage in the process of the comprehensive settlement of the problem by political means  for they are in keeping with the real situation in Cambodia at the present time. The Lao Government whole-heartedly supports the decision of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia to send its delegation to this session of the General Assembly in order to represent the independence  sovereignty and unity of Cambodia in the international arena. On the subject of the present situation in our country  the Lao Government has  for SOME time now  adopted a new policy aimed at expanding our economic co-operation with other countries. To ensure success in the implementation of this new economic policy  we have enacted several laws  such as the Investment Code  the Criminal Code and the Civil Code. In addition  we have prepared a draft of the first constitution of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. That draft is now being discussed by the different sectors of the population and will finally be placed before the Supreme People's Assembly for consideration and approval.In general  the economic situation has become more dynamic than before. The market has expanded  and the production of goods has been developed  thus making it possible gradually to improve the living conditions of our country's multi-ethnic population. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic considers it essential to continue to pursue an outward-looking  market-oriented policy. To do so  it hopes to enjoy the support and co-operation of friendly countries and international organisations.The relations of the Lao People's Democratic Republic with neighbouring countries are generally good. There have been positive developments in Lao-Thai relations. The two countries continue to exchange visits and to hold consultations at different levels  among them that of the two highest-ranking representatives of our national armies. In addition  economic and cultural co-operation between our two countries is developing in c spirit of good-neighbourliness and brotherhood.However  a number of problems remain unresolved  particularly the border dispute in the area of Botine in the Lao Province of Sayabouri and Phitsanoulok in Thailand. On the Lao side  we have put forward several proposals and will do our utmost to resolve the problem jointly  expeditiously and definitively. That would make an important contribution to strengthening relations between Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic.Apart from the question of war and armed conflicts in different regions  other problems are subjects of concern for the international community. I should mention at this point the problem of drugs. which constitutes a long-term danger to mankind unless we can find a solution in time. Above all  we must abandon the old idea that the principal cause of the drug problem is solely drug production. In reality  demand is also an important and inherent factor. Hence the fight against illicit drug trafficking as a result is a matter for collective responsibility and requires international co-operation. with regard not only to punishment but also to financial assistance to developing countries in their efforts to develop substitute crops in the form of the programme of integrated rural development. Furthermore  in order to be effective. such co-operation should be constructive and should be carried out with full respect for the sovereignty and the traditional features of the beneficiary countries. It is in that spirit that the Lao People's Democratic Republic has been co-operating with the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control and the Government of the United States in the implementation of programmes to substitute other crops for the opium poppy in mountain areas. Our Government is ready to co-operate with all countries and international organisations to that end.Although at present  with the exception of the Persian Gulf crisis  there is general detente in the political sphere throughout the world. the world economy is still in a difficult and complex situation. Over the last 10 years  the inequality in economic growth between developed and developing countries has grown worse. and the gap separating the two groups is becoming ever wider. Most developing countries continue to face an unfavourable situation. The prices of raw materials - their main export products - remain very low  and deteriorating terns of trade and high real interest rates have meant a constant increase in their external debt to such a point that they can no longer repay it. In addition  their export products are constantly blocked by the protectionist measures of the developed countries. What is more  some developed countries continue to impose coercive political  economic and other measures such as blockades  embargoes and restrictive trade measures against certain developing countries.This situation compounds the unsatisfactory results obtained in the implementation of the new Substantial Programme of Action for the least developed countries and has made the economic situation of those countries increasingly critical.We feel that insomuch as international political relations have undergone a change for the better  the present system of international economic relations should also be restructured  both in form and in principle. With regard to the least developed countries  we hope that the Programme of Action adopted by the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held at Paris last September will be seriously implemented and that there will be no political pre-conditions for granting aid to them. The characteristic feature of our present-day  evolving world can only be one of mutual assistance and interdependence between the developing and the developed countries. Therefore just and mutually advantageous international co-operation has become more than ever imperative. The fact that we meet here each year affords us all a valuable opportunity to consult among ourselves and jointly to seek a way of making multilateral international co-operation more effective. In multilateral co-operation the United Nations is the Organisation best suited for playing a central role. We must therefore strive to increase the effectiveness of our Organisation in dealing with the problem of ensuring peace  security and international co-operation  in order to respond to the aspirations of mankind as reflected in the Charter of the United Nations  to which all Member States have subscribed. "
"82",3964,"LBN",45,1990,"﻿At the outset it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that you are going to preside efficiently and successfully over the work of this session. I need not remind of the close ties that bind our two countries on every level. On this occasion I should also like to commend the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Ambassador Garba  to whose friendly country  Nigeria  we are bound by ties of friendship and co-operation.Also  I should like to extend our warm greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  and express our appreciation for his devotion to the cause of peace and his sincere concern over the suffering of my country  Lebanon. I should also like to pay tribute to the outstanding role played by our international organisation under his leadership in tackling various regional and international issues. Thanks to the United Nations  smaller nations are given hope that under international law and norms of conduct their rights are protected.I welcome Namibia  the new member of the United Nations  whose independence was the culmination of a ceaseless struggle by its people  in conjunction with an effective role played by our international organisation in developing the machinery that realised that independence. As to Liechtenstein  we welcome it to the fold  wishing its delegation every success.Lebanon is in the forefront of nations which uphold and believe in the Charter and the principles on which it is based. We also consider the United Nations  the alma mater of all international organisations  as the natural and appropriate forum for all peoples of the world in their pursuit of peace and security  stability and orderliness in international relations. Hence  we do not want Lebanon to witness in any way the failure of the United Nations either in resolving certain problems that beset small nations or implementing resolutions adopted by it or any of its organs.For 15 years  Lebanon has been in the throes of as intractable crisis  the repercussions  manifestations and dimensions of which have brought it on numerous occasions to the attention of the Security Council  which adopted a series of resolutions yet to be implemented. Meanwhile  the Lebanese crisis has grown in intensity and reached its peak in the stifling economic plight that Lebanon now suffers  not to mention the social and human tragedies and tribulations suffered by its people and the dangers that beset this small country and threaten its integrity and very existence.In 1978  Israel invaded south Lebanon in the so-called Litani Operation and occupied large tracts of Lebanese soil  most of which are still under its control. The Security Council adopted resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) in the wake of that large-scale aggression wherein the Security Council called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Lebanese territory and set up the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UHIFIL)  which was entrusted with the task of ensuring the complete withdrawal of the invading forces from Lebanese territory. UMIFIL  within the capabilities available to it  played a vital and constructive role which earned it the respect and gratitude of the Lebanese people. That force  however  was not enabled to fulfil the basic mandate entrusted to it  namely  that of ensuring the withdrawal of forces of aggression from Lebanese territory.Meanwhile  two earnest attempts were made to send units of the Lebanese army  with the approval of the United Nations Secretariat and that of the UNIFIL Command in south Lebanon  in order to make headway in implementing United Nations resolutions in accordance with a specific plan aimed at enabling the Lebanese Government to restore its authority over certain parts of the occupied territory. The first attempt was made in 1978  when the Lebanese Government sent army units to the south through the eastern sector. These were stopped short of the occupied area under a barrage of bombardment by the Israeli forces and their proxies. The second attempt was made in 1979 when the Lebanese Government sent a battalion to the coastal area to operate under the UNIFIL umbrella and participate in the implementation of a plan that aimed at liberating certain parts of the occupied area and placing them under UNIFIL control. Again  heavy shelling by Israeli forces and their puppets prevented the Lebanese battalion from reaching its assigned position.Since then  Security Council resolution 425 (1978) has remained unimplemented  and its future seems to be limited to regular meetings of the Security Council to renew the mandate of UNIFIL for another period of time.In the meantime  Lebanon has been the victim of repeated acts of aggression by land  sea and air which have claimed the lives of many innocent civilians and wreaked havoc on our infrastructure  property  installations and public utilities.In 1982  Israel launched total war against Lebanon by breaking through the UNIFIL lines. It occupied large areas of Lebanese soil including  at that time  the capital  Beirut. In waging that war  Israel used the very latest state-of-the-art instruments of annihilation  indiscriminate killing and devastation unscrupulously and with extreme brutality and impunity.The Israeli operations included the detention and kidnapping of many Lebanese citizens  a large number of whom still languish in Israeli jails and in prisons built inside the occupied Lebanese territory. Some of those prisons are inaccessible even to international humanitarian organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross.Israel also confiscated Lebanese water resources in the South  including the tributaries of the Wazzani and Hasbani rivers. Lebanon has repeatedly voiced its concern over Israel's ambitions to grab yet more of Lebanon's water resources.The forces of occupation have created and continue to create a new fait accompli situation in the occupied areas. This is reflected in Israel's economic and social annexation of the border strip through a series of calculated measures that prove Israel has no intention of pulling out its forces of occupation in any foreseeable future. Those measures also indicate Israel's determination to isolate the border area from the Lebanese heartland and thus thwart action in the area by official Lebanese organs.The Lebanese living under the yoke of occupation suffer the most hideous kinds of oppression and persecution. These practices  which run counter to the most rudimentary principles of human rights  have been the subject of repeated condemnations by the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.The popular response to the Israeli occupation has been the emergence and growth of a valiant determined resistance movement through which the Lebanese people continue to assert their natural and legitimate right to freedom and sovereignty over their land and show their determination to regain that right regardless of the sacrifices involved.As for the Lebanese Government  its only option has been to complain to the Security Council. The Security Council adopted several resolutions which condemned the Israeli aggressor. However  such condemnation has been to no avail. On several occasions  the Council even failed to adopt resolutions of condemnation because of the right of veto. In any case  Lebanon has not been able to obtain a single Security Council resolution imposing sanctions against the aggressor State.In the last phase of the crisis  the Arab group laudably undertook to tackle the Lebanese question. The Arab summit conference  meeting in Casablanca  Morocco  decided to set up the Tripartite High Committee  composed of the King of Saudi Arabia  the King of Morocco and the President of Algeria. The Committee was entrusted with the task of addressing the situation in Lebanon and finding an effective solution to the problem that would deal with all its various dimensions. The Committee's efforts came to fruition in a meeting held in the Saudi Arabian city of Taif under the auspices of the Committee and with the direct support of Syria; the meeting resulted in an agreement known as the Document of National Accord.That was the starting point for the revival of our constitutional institutions. That process started with the election of the Speaker and the bureau of Parliament. This signalled the resumption of Parliament's activities after an interruption that had lasted nearly a year and was followed by the election of a new President of the Republic after that office had remained vacant for almost 14 months. A national unity Government was formed and the contents of the Document of National Accord provided its programme of action and has been translated into a constitutional law that has been ratified recently by the Lebanese Parliament.However  the former commander of the Lebanese army persisted in his mutinous stand against legitimacy  thus leaving the country prey to division and in fighting the country's administration remained factionali2ed to a certain extent. Public facilities and many State resources continued to be usurped  while half the army  together with the bulk o. its equipment and supplies  remained confiscated.Lebanon was left with bleak prospects and exposed to imported crises.Here again the United Nations took sound  laudable positions which confirmed the international community's support for the legitimate Lebanese authorities through assistance in implementing the Taif agreement  condemnation of the mutiny against legitimacy and calling on all parties to adhere to the Taif agreement.When Iraq invaded the State of Kuwait we took a clear explicit and principled stand. We strongly denounced the action  since it constituted a flagrant violation of international law  norms and instruments  especially the Charters of the United Nations and of the League of Arab States. Moreover  as a matter of principia  we cannot concede the right of the strong to swallow up the weak or of the large to ruin the snail. Otherwise the law of the jungle would prevail in international relations to the detriment of weaker and smaller nations such as my own.It is worth mentioning that the crisis resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has had catastrophic economic end social effects on the internal conditions in Lebanon. This prompted us to undertake exceptional efforts with a view to ensuring the inclusion of Lebanon on the list of States adversely affected and in need of urgent foreign aid.The crisis has created regions and global tensions  as is evident from the mobilisation of major international military forces in the Arab region. This sets the region atop a volcano on the verge of a massive eruption. If the invasion had resulted only in plunging the Arab nations into great divisions  if it had only brought enormous international military forces and infinite danger to the region  that alone would have been reason enough to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Hence our support for all resolutions adopted in the framework of the League of Arab States  at the level of the summit and at that of Foreign Ministers  and for all the resolutions of the Security Council. However  when we recall all relevant Security Council resolutions  especially resolution 661 (1990) which provides for the imposition of international sanctions against Iraq to deter its aggression  we cannot but recall once more the Lebanese situation. Since 1978  Lebanon has been the victim of aggression by Israel  which has continued to flout the resolutions of the Security Council. Resolution 425 (1978) has remained unimplemented for more than 12 years. Numerous other resolutions subsequently adopted by the Security Council have met a similar fate.Therefore  just as we have supported Security Council resolution 661 (1990) imposing sanctions against Iraq for its occupation of Kuwait. we have repeatedly called in the past and we call again today for the application of the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter against Israel for its continued occupation of Lebanese territory in violation of international law and international instruments. and in defiance of the international will expressed through the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council. In doing so  we are merely giving voice to our belief that the international Organisation must remain the natural refuge for those nations which fall victim to aggression. If we respect the resolutions of the United Nations  it is because we believe that they are just. In international justice  there must be no double standard.We cannot mention Lebanon without speaking of Palestine  the most chronic of all the explosive issues in the Arab region  in the Middle East  even in the world. The right of Palestinians to national determination is a self-evident human right. How can the United Nations realise its lofty mission on behalf of human civilisation or endeavour to lay down the foundations of justice. Stability and peace in the world while the Palestinian population remain displaced  exiled from homeland and deprived of the most rudimentary of human rights  namely  the right to self-determination? Until such time as Israel recognizes the right of Palestinians to self-determination  it is no wonder that they should continue their glorious intifadah against occupation  usurpation and injustice. In defiance of every method of oppression and abuse  the Palestinian people continue to reject Israel's expansionist policy of settler-colonialism at the expense of their self-evident right to existence.The records of the United Nations are replete with resolutions relevant to the question of Palestine. Is it not time for the international Organisation to take decisive and effective measures in order to compel Israel  the aggressor State  to heed its resolutions on this question?My people  like every other people in the Arab region  is gravely concerned about Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union and elsewhere to the occupied land of Palestine and the threat that this migration poses to the right of the Palestinian people to their land and to the stability of the whole region. My people  like every other people in the Arab region  live under the terrible threat arising from the acquisition by Israel of nuclear weapons  especially in view of the aggressive and expansionist nature of its policies. Therefore  it is no wonder that we associate ourselves with those who have already called for the declaration of the Middle East region as a zone free of weapons of mass extermination  namely nuclear bombs  in the interests of world peace.Lebanon stands today at the threshold of a new age  hoping that it will be one of stability  peace and reconstruction. Today  Lebanon needs the support of the international community in order for it to be able to cross this threshold. It will also need the support of the international community tomorrow and day after tomorrow in order for it to regain its health and strength and resume the process of growth and reconstruction. Hence  Lebanon's insistence that the international community should continue to support it in liberating its soil from Israel's occupation through the implementation of resolution 425 (1978) which was adopted by the Security Council 12 years ago. There can be no peace or stability in Lebanon so long as Israel's aggression against it persists. This also implies the lifting of Israel's hand from the water resources in southern Lebanon.My country  Lebanon  is now seeking the necessary foreign assistance to cope with the tragic social and economic crisis which engulfs it  be it the result of the accumulated effects of 15 years of bloody events or the serious consequences of the Gulf crisis.Lebanon attaches great importance to the success of the project called the International Fund to Assist Lebanon  sponsored by the High Arab Committee  which alms at organising joint international action in support of the large-seal· reconstruction effort that Lebanon has to undertake  God willing  in the coming stag· of stability and peace.If things proceed as planned on those levels  Lebanon  reborn  will be the best living proof of the historic achievements heralded by the international community through its solidarity  firm determination and sound orientation.My country  Lebanon  wounded and bleeding  has remained  even under the bleakest of conditions  conscious of its responsibilities towards the international community and has never renounced the aspiration to resume its constructive  creative and natural role in the service of progress and peace in regional and international arenas.We hope that the era of international detente  the dawn of which we are witnessing today  will usher in a relaxation in international relations  engender peaceful solutions for the regional problems of the world and put a decisive end to power rivalry at the expense of the interests of the small  peace-loving nations. We hope that the understanding between the two super-Powers will be the launching pad for a new order that will be based on the consolidation of the rule of international law and the strengthening of its machinery  especially the United Nations."
"83",4011,"LBR",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Liberian delegation I should like at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. We extend our best wishes for success in the execution of the responsibilities that this high calling entails. In this undertaking I assure you of the fullest co-operation of the Liberian delegation. Indeed  your consummate diplomatic skills and wealth of experience in international affairs assure us that the current session will be marked by laudable accomplishments  thus contributing to the noble goals of the United Nations I also have the keenest pleasure in conveying the sincere appreciation of the Liberian delegation to your illustrious predecessor. Ambassador Joseph N. Garba  a distinguished son of Nigeria and Africa  for the most efficient manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.My delegation commends the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts in the cause of international peace and security. His selfless devotion to the United Nations has brought a renewed sense of appreciation for the role multilateral diplomacy can play in the realisation of mankind's cherished dream of a stable international environment.We welcome the Republic of Namibia as it takes its seat for the first time at a regular session of the General Assembly as a sovereign and independent State. My delegation also welcomes the Principality of Liechtenstein as the newest member of this body.I have come to this rostrum with great sadness because  even as I speak  a tragedy continues to unfold in my country  Liberia - a country which attained its independence 143 years ago out of man's inherent aspiration to be free and to determine his own destiny. Liberia  Africa’s oldest republic  and a founding member of the United Nations  is today experiencing a brutal and devastating civil war. Liberia  a country which has enjoyed peace and stability for most of its nationhood  is today being torn asunder. Liberia  a country of almost 3 million people  has been virtually destroyed  its population decimated and hundreds of thousands forced to become refugees abroad and displaced within their own homeland. I take this podium on behalf of these innocent victims of the civil war to call on the international community to bring an end to that war  a war which continues to inflict incalculable loss of human life and property. On behalf of all Liberians I am duty-bound to represent here today  I call upon the Organisation to end this tragedy.As Members  are aware  this crisis erupted on 24 December 1989 and has continued unabated until today  with no end in sight.Early attempts to settle the conflict peacefully proved futile. Appeals were made to the United Nations and to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to prevail upon all parties to enter into negotiations aimed at peacefully resolving the crisis. Later the Liberian Council of Churches sought to mediate in the dispute  and when that failed  the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of Hast African States (ECONAS) undertook mediatory efforts.Following a further deterioration of the crisis  we appealed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 31 July 1990 to have the Security Council seized of this matter. Indeed  we argued that the Liberian conflict could not be viewed as a purely internal matter  since over 500 000 Liberians were refugees in neighbouring African countries  and the continuation of the conflict would adversely affect not only the stability of the subregion but International peace and security as well.After consultations with the members of the Security Council  it was decided that the United Nations would defer to ECOWAS  which had earlier been a mediator in the conflict.It is against that background that the Heads of State and Government of the Mediation Committee of ECOWAS  meeting in Banjul  the Gambia  on 6 August 1990 proposed a peace plan which  inter alia  called for: (1) an immediate cease-fire; (2) the dispatch of a peace-keeping force or cease-fire Monitoring group (BCCMOG) to ensure the Maintenance of the cease-fire; (3) the convening of a national conference of all Liberian political parties and other interest groups for consultations on the formation of a broadly based interim administration; and (4) the holding of free and fair elections within 12 Months.As we are aware  ECOWAS was deployed in Liberia. At a conference held at Banjul  a group of Liberians  representing all recognised political parties and interest groups  elected an interim Government. Subsequently  on 9 September 1990  the Liberian lender  President Samuel Doe  was killed.In spite of those developments  the civil war continues. The majority of the Liberian people are now the unfortunate victims of the crisis. They should not continue to be denied their inalienable right to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness in a peaceful and stable political environment of their own choosing.Indeed  recent events in Liberia should teach us that political change through violence only perpetuates a circle of violence and that the best hope for the country lies in the development and protection of its democratic institutions.We therefore renew the call for all factions in the civil war to agree to an immediate cease-fire and urgently to enter into dialogue  so as to resolve the conflict peacefully  as envisaged by the BCONAS peace plan. It should be remembered that so long as the conflict remains unresolved  it is the Liberian people who will continue to suffer.Let us at this time  however  acknowledge with grateful appreciation all countries and relief organisations which have unhesitatingly offered food  clothing  shelter and other assistance to my countrymen who were forced to flee Liberia  as well as to those who were displaced within the country. WE also thank all of those countries and individuals who continue to mediate in the Liberian crisis  and we pray for God’s blessing on each of you.  Similarly  we call upon those nations  institutions and individuals that  in any way  have contributed or continue to contribute to the human suffering in Liberia to bring an end to the civil war. The wave of democratisation which has a swept across Eastern Europe must be allowed to flourish in countries like Liberia. And the United Nations has a Moral responsibility to support the advancement of the frontiers of freedom  and the development of democratic institutions throughout the world.It is because of the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war that opportunities have been unleashed for nations. As a result  we see the world today standing united against Iraq’s aggression against  and occupation of  Kuwait. A once divided Germany has been reunited. In Eastern Europe  countries which heretofore operated under rigidly controlled system  are breathing the refreshing air of freedom and democracy. Within this context  the Liberian delegation entertains the hope that the forging partnership of co-operation will lend itself to the identification of durable solutions to conflicts in Cambodia  Cyprus  the Middle East  Western Sahara  the Korean peninsula and Central America. We welcome and support expressions for the reunification of the Koreas and membership within the United Nations.Indeed  the support of the BCOHAS peace plan is a direct result of the renewed willingness of the States Members of the United Nations to adhere to Article 52 of the Charter  which encourages the resolution of conflicts through regional arrangements. But more needs to be done. There appears to be an urgent need to take a fresh look at the Charter of the United Nations  especially the provision calling for non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States. Perhaps the Secretary-General's insight into the problem provided a sobering reflection when  in his 1990 report on the work of the Organisation  he said: ""Today  in a growing number of cases  threats to national and international security are no longer as neatly separable as they were before. In not a few countries  civil strife takes a heavy toll on human life and has repercussion beyond national borders. The disintegration of the institutions of government and society in one country and senseless slaughter in another are two appalling instances. Separatism  by no means a rare phenomenon  causes strains on both the country directly affected and its immediate neighbours. Anarchy in one state means mass migration which unsettles the other.  The situation in Liberia undoubtedly fits this description. And in this case  the law of necessity superseded every legal norm. In the cause of humanity the United Nations is obligated and challenged to act to restore peace to Liberia.Should the human rights of the people be violated? Should suffering and death be visited upon a people while the United Nations remain silent because the problems are perceived to be internal? Let the United Nations decide! Indeed  the rights of all peoples are indivisible and if the United Nations is to be true to its moral obligations under the Charter then it must be seen to act quickly in addressing human tragedy wherever they occur - in the Persian Gulf  the West Coast of Africa or elsewhere.The urgent need of Liberia at this time is to end the fighting  install the interim government and demilitarize and disarm the many who bear guns and other weapons of destruction. That government would have the primary task of organising and holding  within 12 months  free and fair elections under international supervision. There are also the formidable tasks of healing the national wounds  resettling the over two million displaced Liberians and reconstructing the country and its economy which have been devastated by war. There is also the task of restoring faith to the Liberian people who are undergoing mental and physical torture.In order to address these challenged confronting Liberia  we request the Members of the Organisation and the Secretary-General urgently to assist Liberia to achieve three major objectives: first  the United Nations is requested to use its moral authority and influence to end the civil war and support the ongoing peace initiative; secondly  the world body is called upon to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to displaced Liberians as well as material and financial assistance for their resettlement and for the reconstruction of war-torn Liberia and  thirdly  the Liberian people desires the development of democratic institutions and calls upon the United Nations to provide technical assistance in supervising the holding of democratic elections in Liberia.As we approach the twenty-first century there is an urgent need for the energies and resources of the international community to be focused on the remaining issues on the agenda of the twentieth century. If our accomplishments in the resolution of conflicts are to be lasting  we must also demonstrate the requisite will to achieve co-operation designed to redress inequities in international economic relations. There are appalling disparities between the rich Worth and the impoverished South. We must therefore resolve that the East-West confrontation will not be supplanted by an imminent North-South divide.Pertinent among the remaining issues is the looming problem of underdevelopment  particularly in the third world. Abject poverty  manifesting itself through ignorance  disease and various social ills  defies amelioration by individual States. In this respect  concrete solutions can be found if concerted international action is launched to bridge the widening gap in economic prosperity between the North and the South. The Liberian delegation associated itself with the recommendations of the South Commission that under United Nations auspices  periodic summits of loaders from a representative group of developed and developing countries be convened to review the world economic situation  particularly the examination of the interrelationship among the various components of the world economy. Liberia remains ever hopeful that the United Nations  with its current enhanced status  is poised and ready to meet these challenges.Liberia  a founding Member of the Organisation  is experiencing a national catastrophe. Today  history has ordained that we serve as the conscience of our people and call upon the United Nations with utmost urgency to address the situation in Liberia and help bring an immediate end to the tragic civil war.A few days ago  in this very Hall  71 Heads of State and Government committed themselves to giving children α better future. Our children  Liberian children  like all other children of the world  are bleeding  sick  starving  without shelter and  more important  without hope. Can this body allow the destruction of not only Liberia's future but of the world's future to go unnoticed? I ask you in the name of God and humanity to come to Liberia's aid in recognition of the fact that we are indeed our brother's keeper. "
"84",4057,"LBY",45,1990,"﻿Before I begin my statement  allow me to read the following message  which the leader of the revolution  President Qaddafi  has asked to convey to the General Assembly. The text will be distributed shortly.""The world is witnessing today the collapse of the post-world war. arrangements  which included the division of Germany end Europe  military alliances  the division of the world into East and West. The fall of the Berlin Nail and the reunification of Germany marked the beginning of the collapse of those arrangements which were basically an act of revenge against the Nazi movement  which had plunged the world into the horrific conflict. The crumbling of those arrangements was followed by the end of the traditional conflict between East and West and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact  which will lead to the collapse of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).""However  the whole world has ignored  deliberately or not  the dangerous nature of a mine which was part and parcel of these post-war arrangements. It is a mine that threatens world peace. It is the Jewish State in Palestine.""The establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine was also an act o£ revenge against nazism which had persecuted the Jews in Europe. It was a reaction brought about by the actions of nazism. However  nazism is now a thing of the past. So  why should an innocent people  the Palestinian people  who had no hand in this  pay the penalty?""The establishment of a State on a religious basis has no acceptable justification. To accept this is to accept the division of the world en a religious basis. That is to say that all the adherents of any one religion have the right to set up a State of their own on any piece of land they choose to make their home. Obviously  the outcome  for the world  would be an unending maelstrom of conflict. ""If  in yesteryears the world sympathized with the Jews and condemned their persecutors  the world must not forget it was Europe that persecuted the Jews. It is Europe that should pay the price. The state of the Jews should be on European soil. We have proposed on several occasions that if there must be a Jewish State  it should be in those areas which we have suggested previously.""The problem of Palestine is one of the most dangerous problems that pose a threat to international peace. It is the root cause of a perpetual ongoing conflict between East and West  Islam and Christianity and the North and the South. It is the direct cause of what is called terrorism  the taking of hostages and other acts of violence.""One wonders why  when the world has succeeded in dealing with the many other crises which posed a threat to the peace of the North  should the world leave the peace of the South at the mercy of the mine of a Jewish State in Palestine? A world that is really serious about peace on earth must realize that the religious character of the Jewish State in Palestine should come to an end. In order to bring that about  all the nations of the world should withdraw their recognition of that State and establish a democratic State of Palestine that would be a home for all its inhabitants  regardless of their religion.""Our advice to the whole world is that if the world really wants peace  it should redress this injustice  just exactly as any other wrong which stemmed from the post-war arrangements has been redressed. Otherwise  present and future generations will pay dearly in violence  terrorism and hate  and the whole world will face the threat of war because of this dangerous mine that has been planted in Palestine."" Having read the message of the leader of the revolution to the Assembly  I come back to my statement. At the outset  I should like to extend to you  Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This gives me special pleasure in that you belong to a country with which my own maintains relations of good-neighbourliness  co-operation and friendship  and in that both countries have long-standing historical ties. I have every confidence that your experience and diplomatic competence will provide the General Assembly with the wise leadership it so greatly needs in light of the crisis through which we are living.I should like  too  to express our esteem and gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  President of the forty-fourth session  for the great efficiency and superb capabilities ha showed in handling the work of that session.I should not fail to express our high esteem and respect for Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for his persistent and sincere efforts to foster the ideals of the United Nations  and for the prominent role he and his colleagues in the Secretariat have played to further the efficiency and effectiveness of the Organization.We are really gratified and proud in these bleak times that our brethren in southern and northern Yemen have been able  by virtue of their faith and determination  to make the dream of the Yemeni Arab people come true by uniting the Yemeni State after a long period of separation. This development has made us really happy  and our happiness will be even greater when the Arabs will be represented in this forum as a single Arab State  and not as a divided Arab group. Permit me  too  to welcome the delegation of the independent State of Namibia  which has taken its rightful place as a Member of the Organization. We in Libya are very pleased that our friends in Namibia have been able to achieve independence after a bitter struggle against imperialism  colonialism and apartheid. Namibia's independence has demonstrated that the people's will for liberation  independence and self-determination cannot be vanquished.I should not fail either to welcome the admission of Liechtenstein to membership of the Organization  for this will contribute to strengthening the United Nations and promote its objectives.I salute  too  the historic unification of the German people. We are sure that their united State will be an active factor of stability  equilibrium and advancement in our world. As a matter of fact  this tendency towards the unification of divided peoples  a phenomenon that began to take root after our last session  should be highlighted  respected and encouraged. I use the word ""divided"" advisedly  because division was imposed on those peoples for reasons I need not recall or dwell upon. The unification of the Yemeni Arab people and the German people - unimaginable for many of us less than a year ago - shows that one of the tendencies which will characterise the next few decades has already emerged and taken root. It is a tendency that will be crucial for the formulation of future international relations  it stems from the aspiration after unity by many a divided people. The Arab people is one of those peoples which were divided in order for them to be easy prey for aggression and dependence. Now I wish I could be proven wrong in this respect. However  I have a strong feeling that is akin to conviction that some of the influential Powers in today's world have taken it upon themselves to perpetuate and further the division of the Arab world into mini-States and small entities that remain easy targets of aggression in order to satisfy their greed and protect their own Interests. That is a near certainty.The Holy Koran tells us: ""And hold fast All together  by the rope Which God (stretches out For you}  and be not divided Among yourselves; And remember with gratitude God's favour on you;For ye were enemies And We joined your heartsIn love  so that by His GraceYe became brethren;And ye were on the brinkOf the Pit of Fire And We saved you from it.Thus doth God makeHis Signs clear to you:That ye may be guided""  <The Holy Koran. III 1103^""And verily this Brotherhood Of yours is a single Brotherhood And I am your Lord And Cherishes thereforeFear We (and no other)""  (The Holy Koran. XXIII˛52ī""Be not like those who are divided Amongst themselves And fall into disputations After receiving Clear Signs:For themIS a dreadful Penalty""  (The Holy Koran. III I 105)To us  therefore  unity is a religious duty and a moral principle. This takes precedence over its being a security  economic or political necessity.Accordingly  the great Powers which believe in fostering Arab disunity and division must realise that by doing that they commit an act of aggression against the very basis of our belief and principles of morality.I found it necessary to extol this orientation towards unity  in the sincere hope that others may review their policies and plans and come to realize that stability  peace and progress in the world require respect for the legitimate aspirations of all peoples.For years  we have been at a crucial juncture that undoubtedly marks the beginning of a new era in international relations. Detente has been achieved and has now developed into entente. It is now universally acknowledged that all of us face serious challenges. Ho longer can any of us say ""after me the flood"". The cold war has ended  and many of the assumptions created by the Second World War have been abandoned. Great technological progress has been achieved. If used altruistically without a priori judgments  it could open new vistas for humanity and lead mankind to a safe future.This is only one face of the coin  however. It does have another face which completely contradicts the first. Entente among the rich and powerful has been confined to the northern hemisphere. The South still faces many crises  some of which have been aggravated and turned into imminent threats to peace  security and stability.Palestine and South Africa exemplify the long suffering of oppressed peoples who have been displaced  oppressed  exploited and subjected to the worst kinds of injustices the appropriation of land  apartheid and attempts at genocide. But still  the hearts and minds of many have been deaf to the call of right  justice and morality. The tragic economic and social plight of many of the peoples of the third world who continue to be victims of hunger and disease is clear enough  as is the continuous deterioration of their resources and capabilities. On the other hand  the drive to dominate  impose hegemony  exploit and intervene in the internal affairs of others continues to be a pattern of behaviour that some seek to justify. The legitimate aspiration of many nations after unity  progress and peace continue to be ignored. All these are but examples.That is why we in Libya  much as we welcome entente between the rich and powerful  believe that such entente will not last unless it encompasses the whole world. This  in turn  will not be achieved unless injustice is redressed and the approaches and policies adopted by many are reviewed and realigned to proper values and moral principles.Allah  the Almighty  said in the Holy Koran ""Generations before youWe destroyed when theyDid wrong"". (The Holy Koran. Xtl3)Unfortunately  the past few weeks have witnessed the development of a serious crisis which greatly concerns my country. I refer to the Gulf crisis which has arisen  unfortunately  between two neighbourly and brotherly Arab countries. It came about in spite of the special relationship among Arab countries and because of the fact that the present Arab political entities and borders are a product of an era of the Arab weakness which was of the making of the colonial Powers that colonised and divided the Arab world. Hence  those entities do not necessarily reflect Arab aspirations or Arab interests. Regardless of this  no one  my country included  can condone the course of invasion  occupation and annexation. My country's position has been clear. We condemned the invasion on the first day and demanded the immediate withdrawal of forces; we stressed that Kuwaiti internal affairs are a matter for the Kuwaiti people alone and that no one had the right to decide for them. Within the framework of the League of Arab States  or bilaterally  the Arabs moved to contain and deal with the crisis.I am sorry to say that Arab efforts were hampered by the few who moved to seize this opportunity to achieve long-cherished goals in the ¡region. They did not act to defend Kuwait  but to tighten their grip over the region's oil fields. They saw in the crisis a golden opportunity that had to be grabbed and exploited. We have seen how reactions followed the actions of those few at a heightened pace. They sent their troops to the region and imposed an embargo against Iraq even before the Security Council could take action  and exerted all manner of pressure and blackmail against various countries to make those countries acquiesce and support them. We only wish that all of this was done with the purpose of maintaining peace and upholding justice and international legitimacy.Only a few weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  the very super-Power that was quick to deploy its forces  impose an embargo and threaten to wage war  had refused to approve the sending of an envoy on a Security Council fact-finding mission to the territories occupied by the Zionists to investigate the systematic policy of murder  deportation and destruction that Israel pursues there. This chameleon-like behaviour throws one off balance. It is regrettable that some countries behave as if legitimacy is to be respected only when it can be pressed into the service of their greed  their interests and their policies. We fear  and all the nations of the third world would be wel1. advised to fear  that this outlook may become entrenched as a result of the changes that have been taking place in our world over the past few years. Those changes  it would seem  have led some to feel that they have come out as the only super-Power in the post-cold war world.From the very beginning of the Gulf crisis  my country insisted that it be resolved within an Arab framework and made intensive efforts to find an Arab solution that would prevent foreign intervention because we are aware of its nature and objectives.My country rejected the foreign presence in the region  called for respecting international legitimacy and called upon the Security Council to perform its duties under the Charter. My country does not concede to any country the right to appropriate for itself any of the Security Council's duties or validities.Colonel Muammar Quadhafi  our leader  proposed an initiative to solve the Gulf crisis on the occasion of the Twenty-first Anniversary of the Great September First Revolution. We hope that concerted efforts will be made to support the search for a peaceful solution that would spare the world the catastrophe of military confrontation in the region.It is in this that we face the first test of our credibility and our ability to achieve genuine international détente. Our true will should be manifested in the changes we would collectively bring about with a view to improving the United Nations. The United Nations should have the central role in developing the new framework of international relations. We have to be careful not to let the United Nations become an obedient tool in the hands of any one State or a group of States that would carry the United Nations along in whichever way they wish.The role of the United Nations still suffers from several shortcomings. We have to take practical  daring steps  in solidarity with each other  to redress the imbalances that have weakened the Organisation. The first step must be a review of the Charter with the purpose of bringing its provisions into step with the profound historical changes we are now witnessing and hope to witness in the future. Some of the provisions of the Charter have become outdated and out of step with international realities. We refer in particular to the prerogative of veto in the Security Council  which has been and continues to be a major hurdle that obstructs the most important role for which the Organization was founded  namely  the maintenance of world peace and security. It is no longer logical to retain this prerogative  which some have used to foster aggression  occupation and invasion.My country attaches special importance to strengthening security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region. It is regrettable that that region continues to be one of the most dangerous hotbeds of tension in the world. In this connection  we should like to endorse the final communiqué of the Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Littoral Countries of the Mediterranean  held in Algeria on 25 and 26 June 1990.The main threat to peace and obstruction to co-operation and stability in the region is the Zionist entity. That entity  having opted for the threat of force  overt aggression  usurpation of land and genocide as a way of life  has transformed itself into an arsenal of every type of weapon of mass destruction. Through its strategic alliance with certain Powers  it has been given the material and technical means which have enabled it to put spy satellites in space and test long-range missiles - one of which  as may be remembered  landed off the coast of the city of Benghazi in 1989 - let alone the development of its nuclear capabilities and other weapons of mass destruction.Despite international entente  many areas of the world still witness an escalation of tension and instability. As a case in point  the Palestine question  in particular  and the Arab-Zionist conflict  in general  have been made to develop in an opposite direction to the general tendency towards détente. This has redoubled the possibilities of a major conflagration.This grave development stems from the conduct of the Zionist entity and the attitude of the Powers which support that conduct. All the resolutions adopted by this forum have elicited nothing but neglect and rejection from the Zionist entity. Undeterred  it goes ahead with the implementation of the racist Zionist movement's scheme of Greater Israel. It stops at nothing in the drive to exterminate the Palestinian people  the rightful owners of the land. It kills  banishes  demolishes houses and deprives the Palestinians of education and the means of livelihood. Today  the Zionist's aim is even clearer than at any other time. They have no qualms about articulating their intention to compel the remnants of the Palestinians to leave their land so that Jews from all over the world may be brought in to replace them as settlers in Palestine and the other occupied Arab territories. Thus they establish the racist Jewish State.It is painful to find some people who regard all this as an issue of human rights. How unfair to human rights! Is there any provision in the instruments of human rights that stipulates the uprooting of people from their land and their country so that other people may be implanted in their place under the pretext that those who are implanted had suffered oppression at the hands of others? Which is the oppressed party here? Is it the person who was born  as were his parents and ancestors  on the land from which he is expelled  or is it the newcomer who has never seen it  nor had his ancestors? By what logic or reason can we accept that the immigration of Jews to Palestine and the uprooting of that country's people is a question of human rights? The massive influx of Jewish immigrants and their settlement in Palestine and in the occupied Arab territories will have horrendous consequences for peace in the region. It is also a flagrant violation of the norms of international law  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international instruments.	The very least that we should do is to expel the racist entity from this Organisation  whose resolutions the entity rejects. The sanctions mandated by the Charter should be imposed upon that entity. Why have they not been imposed in this case? Historical precedents show that such sanctions have been instrumental in redressing wrongs and implementing the principles of the Charter  as in the case of Rhodesia and South Africa.While we welcome the resolution of a number of regional problems and questions under international détente  we would like to draw attention to the continued suffering of the Lebanese people which is one of the consequences of the Zionist aggression against Palestine. Also  the question of Cyprus has not been solved and controversy is still rampant among the parties concerned with the Afghan question. We reiterate our firm positions of principle which we have previously declared from this rostrum concerning those questions. We hope that international détente will create favourable conditions for their just resolution.My country expresses its regret at the failure of the Fourth Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which was held in Geneva recently. While we support the international endeavours to rid the world of the weapons of mass destruction  we stress that those endeavours will succeed only if earnest efforts are made to resolve conflicts and defuse tensions at the international level on the basis of universal disarmament and eradication of all weapons of mass destruction. This cannot be done selectively by focusing on one type or category of those weapons. Such measures should be take£ in an equitable and balanced manner that would ensure the rights of all States to security and development in conformity with the priorities set out in the concluding document adopted at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held in 1978  which gave the highest priority to nuclear disarmament. If international relations have improved and detente has been followed by entente  the world in which we live and which has become one village  even one home still suffers a disparity that is no longer acceptable: a small minority still enjoys material abundance  lives in luxury amidst all the products of advanced technology  while the great majority continues to live in hunger and disease and lacks the basic means of subsistence.Positive developments in international political relations have given us an historic opportunity to remedy the imbalances in international economic relations and establish a new economic order.In conclusion  I believe that the decade of the 1990s will shape the world of the twenty-first century and that it gives us the opportunity to correct our mistakes and put our best foot forward with renewed determination to leave such mistakes behind and lay sound and solid foundations for a world that would be free from injustice - a world where justice and equality prevail and in which we can live together."
"85",4089,"LCA",45,1990,"﻿I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are all well acquainted with your superlative qualities and accomplishments. I therefore have no doubt that you will guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion in the coming months. You my expect nothing but co-operation from the delegation of Saint Lucia.I should also like to thank your predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba  for the excellent manner in which he conducted our affairs during the forty-fourth session.This year we have seen both expansions and reductions in the membership of the most important world Organisation. I am pleased to be able to note our loss of numerical membership with the unification of Yemen and the reunification of Germany. The unity of the peoples in these two countries speaks well for the brave new time in which we live  a time of hope and opportunity. We must not squander it.The admission of a free  independent Namibia to membership of the United Rations earlier this year was the fulfilment of a dream; it took many years of struggle  both on the ground in South West Africa and on the diplomatic front here in New York. I am pleased  as everyone should be  that this struggle has reached a successful conclusion. I am therefore most honoured to welcome Namibia to the ranks of the Organisation.Liechtenstein  too  after two centuries of international relations has joined the Organisation this year. I extend Saint Lucia's congratulations to the Government and people of Liechtenstein. We look forward to working closely with them far into the future.These promising times give new urgency to the principle of the universality of the United Nations. Saint Lucia therefore strongly supports the aspiration of the Republic of Korea to membership in the United Nations  for  as has already been shown twice this year  membership in the United Nations need not be made an obstacle to national reunification.The final decade of this millennium finds the world poised on the threshold of new opportunity  at a crossroad from which there is a choice of direction. We may go down new roads of political peace and economic opportunity  or we may choose the status quo ante business as usual.But we  today's generation of leaders  must choose carefully  lest future generations condemn us for having squandered precious opportunities. We cannot allow behaviour  in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere  not in consonance with our purposes to shatter the march of progress.The twilight of totalitarianism seems to be returning some parts of the world to the brink of a frightening resurgence of nascent nationalism  threatening to unleash a latent ethnic parochialism that can lead not to national unity but to international balkanisation. If ethnic nationalism  whether in the Soviet Union  Eastern Europe or South Africa  spies out of control  we shall be plunged into a dangerous new world of balance-of-power politics  with constantly shifting coalitions that can only reach a denouement of forceful consolidation.The new political order must be buttressed by an enhanced international security system  within the purview of the Charter of the United Nations  that promotes the peaceful settlement of disputes and can react quickly to extinguish fires before they rage out of control. In this  the Decade of International Law  the rule of law must predominate in the conduct of international relations. International law must never again be silent in the face of naked power.In this vein  the world has justly condemned the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. It is a blatant act of raw aggressions which will long live in infamy  not only because it is a wicked act of aggression of a large  militarily strong  State against a small  weaker neighbour - but also because it comes at a time when the arrow is pointed in the direction of peace  destroying the opportunity for a new Peace of Westphalia  and again bringing the world to the brink of another major war. As a small  peace-loving State  Saint Lucia finds the Iraqi political position to be totally indefensible  and we hope that Iraq will come to recognize that its military position is untenable as well. Saint Lucia hails the members of the Security Council for their unprecedented co-operation on this matter  and we have already taken the necessary domestic actions to ascertain that we are in full compliance with the Council's mandates. Our hearts go out to the thousands of people/ both Kuwaitis and foreigners  whose lives were disrupted by this invasion.In fine  it was wrong for powerful Iraq to have invaded a powerless neighbour  thus violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is right that the United Nations should unite its strength to force the aggressor to remove itself from Kuwait. For what is right can never be wrong  and what is wrong can never be right.As the cold war has ended  the United Nations too has come in from the cold. Friends of the Organisation have long said that if it did not exist it would have to be invented. Saint Lucia is pleased that it does exist  and now in its forty-fifth year is stronger and more vigorous than ever before in solving the problems we continually create.Indeed  the past few years have been the years of the United Nations. Again and again the Organisation has been a good broker of peace  both in domestic and in international ware  and has entered bold new electoral areas  such as in Namibia and Nicaragua  to ensure that the voice of the people calling for the enthronement of democracy is not denied a just hearing.The people of Haiti too  who have suffered for far too long  look to the Organisation to assist them in going with the tide of democracy that is sweeping the world. Legalistic notions of strict constructionism vis-à-vis the Charter should not be used to throw obstacles in the way of the people of Haiti as they seek to shed their authoritarian legacy and rebuild an economy that can only be described as war torn. We in the Caribbean Community see our own fate as linked to that of the people of Haiti  not only until the December elections but forever more. Haiti  therefore  cannot be allowed to miss this last train. Within the purview of the Organisation of American States (OAS)  Saint Lucia has already dispatched an electoral team to Haiti. We look forward to doing the same within the ambit of the United Nations as well.The seeds of destruction of the vile system of apartheid have been sown with the release of Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  setting South Africa on an ineluctable course to genuine democracy. There can be no turning back. Saint Lucia is therefore most distressed by the fratricidal violence among ANC and Inkatha supporters that has claimed so many lives in the past few weeks. We hope that this internecine conflict will quickly come to an end  paving the way for a united front in the negotiations to end apartheid. The global community demonstrated its unanimity on the question of official racism only last month by its consensus adoption of the resolution at the resumed session of the General Assembly on apartheid. We can expect no leas a demonstration of solidarity from the victims of apartheid. Saint Lucia praises the stops taken so far to bring apartheid to a long-overdue end but wishes to make it for over clear that the removal of economic sanctions will be supported only when real democracy has come to South Africa through the adoption of a system of ""one man  one vote"".Unfortunately  we continue to have a number of problems that have proved intractable and thus resistant to the tide of change and conciliation that has been sweeping the world. The Palestinian intifadah has passed its one-thousandth day and continues unabated with no end in sight. The Palestinian dream of a homeland  therefore  seems as far away as it ever was  having been dealt a regressive blow by the current terrible events in the Persian Gulf region.The long-term conflicts in Angola  Mozambique and the Horn of Africa have yet to reach final solutions  and new problems in Liberia cause us great concern. The same is true in Cyprus  where no progress has been made in the talks between the leaders of the two Cypriot communities.However  in other areas  such as Cambodia and Western Sahara  we are on the road to comprehensive settlements  and Saint Lucia continues to support the efforts and involvement of the United Nations.Despite scattered pockets of bellicosity  the world  for the first time in many decades  stands at the periphery of the possibility of international peace. With a sweep of the political wand  we are well on the way to revising the historical definition of East and Host. The traditional definition of North-South  too  must be revised  and that will take a political decision of an economic nature  a decision which will turn the Plan of Action for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade into an economic and fiscal blueprint for the development of the South. Having failed to attain the majority of the goals and objectives of the Third Development Decade  it is critical  especially in today's volatile international economic atmosphere  that the goals of the Fourth Development Decade  which I expect we shall adopt unanimously in the coming weeks  should be addressed with a purposeful seriousness by both North and South in order to promote their realisation with all deliberate dispatch.Last May we adopted the Declaration on International Economic Co-operation and Development  setting out an agreed understanding for the revitalisation of economic growth and development of the developing countries  so as to realise the basic rights of all human beings to a life free .from hunger  poverty  ignorance  disease and fear.	-That Declaration  in our view  reflects an international consensus on the critical economic situation of the developing countries when viewed in the aggregate. Close to 1 billion people in the developing world still live in a state of chronic hunger and malnutrition  and each year 13 to 18 million of them die because of hunger.Last year the developed market economies grew by 3.5 per cent  continuing their longest period of economic expansion in post-war history. However  at the same time  1989 growth in the developing countries was at its lowest  in six years  down by almost 1.5 per cent from the year before  even though the collective value of their exports did increase by some $80 billion.In my own region  Latin America and the Caribbean  the 1980s have aptly been given the designation of the ""Lost Decade"". At the end of 1989 real per capita product in the region stood at the level of 13 years earlier. The rate of growth declined from 5.5 per cent in the 19708 to just over 1 per cent in the 1980s. As a result  per capita gross domestic product this year is almost 10 per cent lower than it was in 1980. Between 1980 and 1988 Latin America’s terms of trade fall by about 25 per cent. However  it was even worse for Africa and East Asia  as their terns of trade fell by almost 40 par cant. A major economic crisis was averted by an almost equal decline in fuel prices  amounting to about 50 per cent  during the same period. But  even as I speak  the terms of trade continue to decline for many non-oil-exporting developing countries as the cost of fuel  ignited by the crisis in the Persian Gulf region  is again going up  affecting the man-in-the-street in the South and the collective meagre foreign exchange reserves of many poor countries. This could create a critical economic situation  given the fact that most of the affected countries entered the 19908 under the burdens of the recessionary inertia of the 1980s and their heavy external commitments.As we enter the final decade of the country  the Latin American and Caribbean region continues to be beset by major shortcomings  including the increasing obsolescence of its stock of capital goods and physical infrastructure  a growing gap between the intensive technological changes taking place in the world and their lack of application in the region  and the frustration of an ever-increasing number of people trying to enter the work-force. In fact  this year may well b  the third consecutive year of negative per capita growth in Latin America.In the decade of the 1980s  political interaction in Latin America  was strengthened  but public institutions were weakened. While popular political participation became the modus vivendi  structural adjustment had an extremely high social cost for the middle-level and popular strata. Thus  vast numbers of people made political gains while they progressively lost economic support.Fledgling democracies are often endangered by lack of economic foundations which allows for an equal rate of growth of political and economic development. President George Bush's Enterprise of the Americas  with its tripartite pillars of trade  investment and debt reduction  is therefore timely.In meeting these challenges  we in the region have taken many bold initiatives  aimed at consolidating and buttressing the economic potentialities of the region. High on this agenda of initiatives is the economic integration of the 34 million people of the Caribbean into the larger continental Latin subregion. Those activities have been given a great fillip by recent actions of the Government of Mexico  taken both at the level of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari himself.In the Commonwealth Caribbean subregion  we are extremely delighted that the historic  linguistic  demographic and other criteria that have long separated us from Latin America are falling by the wayside as we have come to recognise that the things that bind us are far greater than those that separate us. We look forward to this deepening of the integration process  always mindful to remain in compliance with the most-favoured-nation provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Though Saint Lucia is not among the least developed countries  those countries are high on our list of concerns. As the 300 to 400 million people of Western Europe look forward to a bright and prosperous future beyond the watershed expectations of ""fortress Europe"" in 1992  the 300 to 400 million people of the least developed countries look forward only to a bleak economic future.In the 1990s growth in the least developed countries did not roach expectations  achieving only about one third of the 7.2 per cent target of the Substantial New Programme of Action which was adopted in 1981. This was aggravated by the decline in investments in the least developed countries by about 2 per cent per year through the 19808; and during the same period  agricultural output in the last developed countries failed to keep pace with population growth. Both the share of world exports and the terms of trade of the least developed countries have been on a seemingly inevitable downward slide as the modest Official Development Assistance target of 0.15 per cent which they expected was not realised. The failure of last Month's Paris meeting to reach a new  agreed official development assistance target for the least developed countries is therefore most discouraging.Nine of the 42 least developed countries face the additional  monumental difficulty of also being small island-developing countries.In a rapidly changing economic world  small island-developing countries struggle to keep pace  weighed down by a host of peculiar developmental problems  among which are poor resource endowments; reliance on a few primary export products; extremely small domestic markets; limited possibilities for industrialisation and  therefore  little opportunity for import substitution; almost total dependence on foreign capital and social and physical infrastructure; and  certainly not least among these particular problems  the proneness to natural disasters.In 1980  nearly 90 per cent of my country's gross domestic product was destroyed by a hurricane. Fiji suffered a similar fate more recently  losing more than 40 per cent of its sugar output. The same is true of Tonga  where in 1962 a hurricane destroyed 50 per cent of the housing and 90 per cent of the banana crop. Saint Lucia is therefore gratified that the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme will have more resources available for disaster mitigation in the fifth programming cycle. We also see as positive the successful outcome of the first Meeting of the Governmental Experts of Island Developing Countries and Donor Countries and Organisations  which we held in June this year. It was the first small step by the global community in recognising that small island-developing countries have particular problems and special needs that are different from those of developing countries in general. The stagnation in international trade in the last decade has left a residual legacy of protectionism in the developed market countries that cannot be justified by their current unemployment trends. Non-tariff measures continue to reduce world trade by over $300 billion annually. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Sound in the coming months should usher in a more liberal trading regime to the benefit of both North and South.We the members of the Caribbean Group for Co-operation in Economic Development (OECD)  though members of a number of preferential trading arrangements  experienced average unit-price declines for our total exports. This meant that over the past decade we have had to export more and more goods to earn the same level of income. And had we in aggregate not had modest increases in our exports of manufactured goods  declining primary commodity prices would have negatively affected all of our balance sheets.On the positive side  prospects for multilateral development assistance improved last year as commitments rose to $35 billion  of which $2 billion were commitments for the operational activities of the United Nations. And net resource transfers to developing countries  through multilateral development loans  rose by some $3.5 billion.The economic integration process of the developing world also improved last year as we in the Caribbean community gave new impetus to our trading relations under the Treaty of Chagaramus  and we saw the signing of the Asian-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum Agreement  the Arab Maghreb Union Treaty and the Arab Co-operation Council Agreement.In conclusion  then  we are poised on the periphery of a new political dawn. But we must seize the day in the economic realm also  especially in the developing countries  for political tranquillity cannot thrive in the midst of economic and social deprivation. "
"86",4115,"LIE",45,1990,"﻿On 18 September  with you presiding  my country was admitted to the United Nations as the one hundred sixtieth Member. Today  for the first time as a speaker in the general debate of the General Assembly  I am pleased to avail myself of this opportunity to wish you once again every success in your responsible tasks.At the same time  I wish to thank all those delegations that greeted and welcomed Liechtenstein with such warmth on the occasion of our country's admission as a new Member of the United Nations.My special thanks are due to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless devotion to accomplishing the tasks with which the United Nations has been entrusted.On the occasion of the address of thanks which I delivered on 18 September  I had the opportunity to describe  briefly  the Principality of Liechtenstein  its bilateral and multilateral relations on a regional European and on a world-wide level and  in particular  the Principality's links established within the framework of the United Nations. Without wishing to repeat myself in this respect  I should like to outline a few aspects which have priority as far as my country's foreign policy is concerned  taking into account the fact that my country is now a Member of the United Nations.You yourself  Mr. President  as well as previous speakers  have laid emphasis on the numerous and far-reaching changes that have taken place in the world in the recent past. New possibilities for peace and international co-operation have opened up  but we are also confronted with great dangers and risks  which will require co-operation by all countries if they are to be resolved.In this connection  it goes almost without saying that a small country like Liechtenstein wishes to align itself with all those countries whose aim it is to settle disputes peacefully and to uphold the rule of law in the settlement of conflicts. International law is our protection and we are all called upon  now and in the future  to further its cause. With this thought in mind  Liechtenstein condemns very strongly the flagrant violation of universally recognised international norms by Iraq in its occupation and annexation of Kuwait and calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory. My country did not hesitate to implement the resolutions and measures adopted by the Security Council even at a time when it was not yet a Member of the United Nations. It will continue to support the efforts exerted by the Security Council with a view to solving this serious crisis.For us international law is the pillar upon which every inter-State relationship must rest. My country will therefore support all efforts now and in future which may lead to the creation of a system of international law in the fields of security and human rights and also of economic  technological and environmental policies. In so far as Liechtenstein is not yet a party to a number of agreements  my Government is examining the possibility of signing and ratifying United Nations legal instruments established in these fields.It is in Europe  indeed  to which my country belongs  that we have observed and continue to observe that peaceful dialogue is possible across all frontiers and despite widely different situations in the countries concerned. As the recent past shows  such dialogue abolishes artificial and inhuman frontiers and may lead to a new and  as we all hope  strong and united Europe. We hope that all efforts for a new Europe will be successful - particularly with regard to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  whose reforms are leading them to freedom and democracy  and where human rights and fundamental freedoms have been given the prominent place they deserve. As we all know  those are the main prerequisites for lasting peace. In that regard  I should like to wish the Federal Republic of Germany and the German people well-being and a prosperous future in view of the unification celebrated yesterday.In the light of the universality of the United Nations - a principle that all Members States underlined when Liechtenstein was admitted as a Member of this family of nations - my country would welcome membership of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations. Nevertheless  in doing so I would like to express the hope that we shall all be able to witness the reunification of the Koreas in the not-too-distant future.Nest November's Paris meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will provide a further guarantee for what has been achieved in Europe so far and at the same time  in line with our expectations  contribute significantly to stability and co-operation as well as to disarmament. It is also important for us in that regard that the Council of Europe  which provides an eminently suitable forum for the expansion of European co-operation  be considered whenever institutional questions are being discussed.However  questions concerning peace  security  disarmament and human rights cannot and should not be resolved by solutions that are related solely to Europe. Europe is a part of the world common to all of us  in which we realize daily the extent and increase of global mutual dependence.The path towards a better future shall not become the private path of a privileged section of our community of States. In view of the favourably developing climate of co-operation between East and West  let us not lose sight of the equally important dimension of the North-South relationship  nor of the co-operation with countries forming the major part of our world community. Those countries are facing extremely difficult problems that  in a vicious circle of cause and effect  will grow worse every day if joint steps are not undertaken to overcome them.International solidarity is required of us all through co-operation and tangible help  taking account of the national characteristics  culture and identity of the countries and peoples concerned. We all know that real changes  economic success  the elimination of poverty and the raising of living standards cannot be achieved from one day to the other. Lasting peace is indivisible. Lasting well-being must also be indivisible.We were therefore very pleased that at the World Summit for Children held last weekend  a Declaration and a Plan of Action on the survival  protection and development of children were adopted. We also attach value to the fact that the Convention on the Sights of the Child  which I signed last Sunday on behalf of my country  should get world-wide recognition.As in the past  Liechtenstein will also be prepared in the future to make its contribution within the framework of international solidarity in favour of the developing countries. Special emphasis will continue to be placed on the support of concrete projects.Also of common interest to everyone is the preservation of our environment. Its damage and destruction  with consequences extending beyond all frontiers  regardless of any geographical location  may well be disastrous for us all if determined action is not taken immediately. We look forward to the Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992  However  we cannot wait with measures to protect the environment until that conference is held  although  we trust  it will lead to tangible achievements and results. From the viewpoint of a small country  I have endeavoured to portray just a few of the many subjects that are of concern to us all  and 1 should like to express the readiness of my Government and of the Liechtenstein delegation to participate  within our possibilities  in international co-operation  and in particular within the framework of the United Nations. In this spirit  I wish the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly full success."
"87",4162,"LKA",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of President Premadasa and the people of Sri Lanka  I extend to the President and to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session our warmest greetings and good wishes. We offer him our special congratulations on his election. That unanimous election is a fitting tribute to his statesmanship as well as to his country. Malta and Sri Lanka have enjoyed close relations  particularly in the Commonwealth forums and in the Non-Aligned Movement. My delegation offers him our support and co-operation. Sri Lanka wishes to express its appreciation of the excellent manner in which the out-going President  Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria  conducted the work of the forty-fourth session.I wish to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his outstanding contribution to strengthening the role of the United Nations in current international affairs.It gives me great pleasure to welcome the delegation of independent Namibia as a full Member of the United Nations. The freedom struggle of the people of Namibia has been one of the most inspiring popular movements of this century  and we are certain that the delegation of Namibia will contribute in good measure towards the success of this session. I also welcome Liechtenstein  as the newest Member of the United Nations. As we welcome the forty-fifth session  we find ourselves facing a period of complex developments whose course is not yet clear. Some developments offer hope for the future and enhance the prospects for peace  while others are less encouraging.The improved relationship between the two super-Powers  which control devastating military arsenals  has certainly reduced the threat of a global nuclear conflagration  yet a sense of euphoria would be premature. Much more remains in their armies to disband. Testing to improve further the lethal effects  accuracy and range of nuclear weapons continues unabated. Regional conflicts and conventional wars continue. The sense of mutual accommodation and understanding that now seems to guide relations between the super-Powers must be extended to cover their relations with the rest of the world. All inter-State relations should be conducted on the firm footing on which the United Nations is founded - respect for the sovereign equality of all States irrespective of their size and power.We have witnessed several dramatic developments during the past year.East-West rivalry has receded  and a new international order is emerging.Financial power and economic strength rather than military might are emerging as the new determinants of global influence. Yet this is not the end of history  nor even the absolute triumph of one idea over all others. We are still in a period of change.Tomorrow we shall witness the emergence of a united Germany  and Sri Lanka heartily welcomes that new development. We welcomed the reunification of Yemen earlier this year. We look forward to the successful conclusion of the efforts of the Korean people to overcome its differences and to take its rightful place is the Assembly as a full Member of the United Nations. The international community must. encourage the intensification of dialogue in Korea. I should also mention that the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation  to which Sri Lanka has the honour to belong with sis other £3uth Asian nations  has made remarkable progress during the past year on several programmes of common interest. Those programmes were intended not only to enhance the living standards of the people of our region but also to contribute to world peace and progress.Despite those favourable developments  we also see in other settings the unhappy consequences of divisive tendencies  be they political  economic or ethnic. Old prejudices have persisted  defying solution. Disparities and inequalities have been aggravated  hindering economic growth and stifling national development. While the debate about alternative economic systems plays itself through  for many developing countries the options have even narrowed.Many developing countries have had to contend with political and other factors that have been obstacles to progress. Resources best deployed for investment in the future of our peoples have had to be diverted to meet other threats  zone of which have even challenged the very existence of States.Many of those countries have made radical adjustments in their economies  often at the bidding of International financial and lending institutions. However  despite this  the general position is that the stagnation and even decline in their development programmes have not been averted. In the 1990s the trends towards integration of new economic groupings in Europe and the growth of vibrant economic centres in Asia are likely to be accelerated. Ideally  that should lead to a greater openness in world markets. However  some concerted global action is required to prevent any drift towards unilateralism and the construction of walls of protectionism and discrimination that would stifle access of the exports of the developing countries to the affluent markets of the developed world. The 1990s will also see the emergence of newly energised economies in Eastern Europe  and it is hoped that that will contribute to the expansion and enrichment of the world economy. Here too  it is essential that the economics of the developing countries should not  for political or economic reasons  be further isolated and ignored in their bid for transfers of technology and scientific knowledge  external resources and credits for other markets. In that connection  Sri Lanka looks forward to the Special Ministerial Meeting of the Economic and Social Council in July 1991  which will study in depth the impact of the recent evolution of East-West relations on the world economy  in particular on the economic growth and development of the developing countries.The multilateral mechanisms of the United Nations system should be effectively used to promote balanced  even and equitable growth in all sectors of the world economy. While interdependence is now an accepted reality  international economic co-operation has not been adequately advanced  the healthy world economy requires that no single group of countries should remain depressed or isolated. Similarly  in a national economy  it is vital that all people should have the opportunities and the necessary resources to participate productively in the development effort.In Sri Lanka we are seeking to tap the latent energies of all segments of our people. The poorest of the people are being given a sense of their own worth and dignity by President Premadasa through a programme called Janasaviya  which literally translates as the strength or solidarity of the people. That initiative  rather than providing charity  offers the poorest families the resources required not only to meet their immediate consumer needs but also to participate in productive economic activity. That has helped to release the creative energies of a group that has far too long been considered fit only to receive charity.  The provision of suitable housing constitutes important support for the alleviation of poverty as well as for the evolution of stable and viable societies  h housing settlement well integrated with the environment promotes a sense of belonging  builds a feeling of security and encourages community participation among its inhabitants. All this is essential for steady and sustained economic activity.A proposal made in this Assembly Hall by President Premadasa to declare 1987 the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless has spread its benefits well beyond that year. The Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000 is being implemented as the most ambitious programme that the international community has so far adopted in the field of human settlements. The support of the international community must continue so that the full potential of the Strategy can be realised.Permit me at this stage to touch on another economic initiative which could bring economic benefit to millions. Last month I had the pleasure of attending the second ministerial meeting of the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Co-operation (IONAC) held in Arusha  Tanzania. An Agreement was adopted at the meeting which  once ratified  would formally make ICKAC en inter-governmental organisation  with its secretariat in Colombo. I0MAC seeks to develop on the rich promise of the new ocean regime for the economic advancement of millions of people in the Indian Ocean region through inter-regional co-operation  as well as through co-operation with technologically advanced countries. I wish to acknowledge the help of the United Nations system  particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Co-ordinator of the Office of the Law of the Sea  as well as non-governmental organisations and donor Governments whose support and encouragement has mad  viable this unique partnership in ocean resources development. My delegation will co-operate with Tanzania  which will be initiating a resolution on IOMAG at this session. For some years now  the role of the United Nations in international affairs  political as well as economic  has been a major issue of debate. The pros and cons of multilateral  bilateral  and indeed unilateral  approaches have been discussed in this forum  also in the context of disarmament and the changing great-Power relationship. In the political field  the essence of multilateralism is that global issues are best considered with the participation of all States in a spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation so that solutions eventually reached will have taken serious account of the interests of the States concerned. That super-Power confrontation in the past has obstructed the United Nations in taking decisive action has been a matter for regret. If  by the same token  the emerging super-Power relationship of co-operation were now to facilitate decisive action  it would also be regrettable if in this new situation the interests of the less powerful States were to be neglected.In the settlement of political issues  the United Nations can play a major role  not only in identifying  on the basis of Charter principles  consensus all directly affected but also in providing a framework within which the process of implementation can be carried out. This was the case in respect of Namibia. Similarly  the United Nations has other achievements to its credit.The United Nations and the Secretary-General have played a key role towards the settlement of the complex and interrelated issues involved in the situation in Afghanistan. The Geneva agreements  concluded in April 1988  and the completion of the withdrawal of foreign troops in accordance with these agreements  set the basis for a comprehensive political solution. All parties concerned should work towards the complete cessation of hostilities and the creation of the necessary conditions of peace and normalcy which would enable Afghan refugees to return home in safety and honour. Regional initiatives  together with efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council  have helped bring about favourable developments in respect of Cambodia. Sri Lanka is happy that agreement has now been reached on a framework for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict. We welcome in particular the agreement reached by all Cambodian parties at Jakarta to form a supreme national council. We look forward to further successful negotiations which would finalise a plan of implementation to ensure a viable and enduring settlement bringing peace and security to the Cambodian people.Sri Lanka followed with keen interest the work of the Secretary-General's mission of good offices in respect of Cyprus. The presence of foreign occupation forces in the Republic of Cyprus has remained an obstacle to a lasting settlement of all aspects of this question. Sri Lanka supports the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus.Unlike in the case of Namibia  the efforts of the United Nations have not been successful in respect of South Africa where the abhorrent apartheid system continues to deny the majority of the people their inalienable rights through ruthless forms of repression. The release of the patriot Nelson Mandela offers some hope. However  the essential structures of institutionalised racism remain in place  particularly in the political field  even though the liberation organizations have reiterated a preference for realising their objectives through peaceful means. Apartheid remains a central factor causing instability even beyond the borders of South Africa. The United Nations should intensify its action in support of the total destruction of apartheid  and the establishment of majority rule in a united  non-racial and democratic society  guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all the peoples of South Africa.Another major issue that has remained on the United Nations agenda without settlement is the question of Palestine  in many ways the core of the complex of interrelated issues that has for so long denied the Middle East region peace and security. Sri Lanka believes that the question of Palestine can be settled only on the basis of the recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israeli forces fro  Palestinian and ether occupied Arab territories. Only this can guarantee the security of all States in the Middle East within secure and internationally recognised borders. Various bilateral and Multilateral efforts towards a settlement of the Palestine question continue. An international conference on the Middle East  as called for by the United Nations with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation  would be the most appropriate framework to consider the question Palestine.A further flash-point of tension and conflict has now arisen in the Middle East. Sri Lanka has been greatly distressed that the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq  which was under discussion in the Arab League  could not be settled through negotiations and has led to the Iraqi Military intervention in Kuwait. Sri Lanka upholds the principle of the sovereign equality and independence of all States. We call for the peaceful settlement of disputes and oppose the threat or use of force. These are unshakeable principles. Sri Lanka expresses the fervent hope that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and those of the Mon-Aligned Movement will be applied to the situation in Kuwait and that it will be possible to reach a settlement enabling the withdrawal of Iraqi forces free Kuwait and a settlement of the disputes at issue between Iraq and Kuwait. The government of Sri Lanka has taken necessary steps to comply fully with the Security Council resolutions on the issue.The current situation in Kuwait has also caused human  social and economic problems of massive dimensions. Hundreds of thousands of guest workers in Kuwait have left or are leaving under conditions of great difficulty. Sri Lanka has been one of the worst affected; out of more than 100 000 employed in Kuwait  more than 90 per cent of female workers hailing mainly from a rural background and innocent victims of this conflict. My government is now making arrangements at considerable cost to evacuate these helpless persons. We express our sincere appreciation to all those government and organizations which have helped Sri Lanka carry out this responsibility.  The recent developments in Kuwait and other affected areas  have also imposed a heavy burden on Sri Lanka’s economy  as no doubt on the economies of other countries. The World Bank has particularly identified the economies of loath Asia as those which have been most adversely affected by the developments in Kuwait  including the loss of important exports to the region  the loss of remittances of expatriate workers and the rising price of oil.These developments in the Gulf area have also underlined the imperative seed for the achievement of the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. This Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment that concrete action for the achievement of the objectives of the Declaration would be a substantial contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security as well as to the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and peaceful development of the States of the region. Sri Lanka regrets that it has not been possible this year to adopt a consensus resolution in the United Nations ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. We sincerely hope that those States have felt it necessary to withdraw from the Committee will soon be able to return to it and work together with the Indian Ocean States and others. Sri Lanka  for its own part  remains committed to hosting the United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean in 1992  and we welcome any suggestions that would make possible a successful and result-oriented Conference.Permit me to say a few words on the situation in Sri Lanka  which has figured - sot always without distortion - in the international media. We have had to face a serious threat to our territorial integrity when separatist violence reached its peak is the island  A fragment of the Tamil community in the country took to terrorism in order to force their demands on the rest of Sri Lanka  A period of violence and instability is the northern areas ensued  claiming a death toll of several hundred.Matters deteriorated to the point when the Government at the time  is 1987  agreed to the introduction of as Indian peace-keeping force into the affected areas. Despite a bloody campaign lasting two years  those forces were usable to bring peace to Sri Lanka or halt the terrorist violence.President Premadasa appealed to all militant groups to negotiate their grievances peacefully and participate freely in the democratic processes to which Sri Lanka has long been committed. The militant groups  including the most uncompromising among then  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  responded positively to this appeal. The Government then proceeded to a dialogue with those groups. Meanwhile  at the request of President Premadasa  the Indian peace-keeping force was also withdrawn from Sri Lanka.However  virtually in the midst of the negotiations  the LTTE  in June of this year  plunged the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka into violence and chaos  ruthlessly attacking police posts and even policemen who had already laid down their arms. The LTTE  intolerant of any opposition to its vision of a mono-ethnic secessionist state  systematically eliminated leaders and cadres of rival Tamil parties. Civilians were similarly massacred. The Government had no option in this situation but to take all possible steps to safeguard the lives of those under threat and to halt the LTTE in its bloody tracks. Negotiations with all parties other than the LTTB continue under the direct guidance of the President himself on the basis of his negotiating triad of consultation  compromise and consensus. The conflict in Sri Lanka is thus one against the LTTE  which has rejected the negotiating option acceptable to all others  and is therefore not against the Tamil community.Many civilian lives have been lost; several cold-blooded massacres of the Muslim community in the Eastern Province have left hundreds dead. Tens of thousands of Sri Lankans of all communities have been forced to flee the Northern and Eastern Provinces  where the LTTB has been active  to the safety of other parts of Sri Lanka  where all communities are able to live in harmony. Movement of food supplies and the operation of essential services are obstructed by the LTTB. A massive exercise has been mounted by the Government  with the support and help of international agencies  such as the International Committee of the Red Cross  to ensure that essential food supplies reach the civilians and the refugees.The Sri Lanka Government remains open to a political settlement of the ethnic question. However  to be part of the process  the LTTB must forswear violence and abandon arms. Any party which seeks to represent the Tamil minority must through democratic means seek the votes of the people. No one can represent the people through the hidden bomb  the landmine and the gun.The LTTB’s external ramifications  including its links with other terrorist groups as well as international drug cartels  are extensive. An evil trinity of international terrorism  drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade clearly exists and requires nothing less than a global effort to destroy it. Many of the problems each State must face are indeed problems we all share and need to confront together.Technology  which knows no national boundaries  has given us nuclear overkill  the dubious capability to destroy ourselves several times over. Happier applications of science and technology have  of course  improved the quality of life for some of us  shrunk distances  spread knowledge and made us more conscious of each other. At the same time  we realise that  despite these advances  the resources of planet Earth  which makes all this possible  are not infinite. We need to manage and utilise these limited resources more rationally and more equitably. The myopic and greedy depletion of these resources will not only exhaust them  but also cause irreparable harm to the Earth's environment and pose unknown dangers to life on Earth  particularly if the protection and preservation of the environment are not understood and accepted as a national and global imperative.Sri Lanka is a small island of about 25 000 square miles  where the preservation of the environment is one of the country's major priorities - at State level  as well as at other levels  involving the people  including children. We should also like to make a modest contribution to the international consideration of the issues involved. Sri Lanka offers Colombo as the venue for the 19tb General Assembly of the World Conservation Union in 1993.Two days ago this Assembly was the venue of a historic Children's Summit. The Summit declared  inter alia in paragraph 8 of its Declaration:""Together  our nations have the means and the knowledge to protect the lives and to diminish enormously the suffering of children  to promote the full development of their human potential and to make them aware of their needs  rights and opportunities."" It rightly concluded that recent improvements in the international political climate could facilitate the task.Each of us here represents a nation State  and therefore the United Nations is  in a sense  a Parliament of Nations. Together  we hold the world in trust for our children. We owe them at least the duty to leave this planet not much worse than when we inherited it from the generations before us. This is the minimum responsibility we are expected to fulfil; let us not neglect it.In conclusion  I reaffirm my country's unstinted encouragement and support for all the activities of the United Nations to achieve the cherished objectives enshrined in its Charter."
"88",4204,"LSO",45,1990,"﻿Permit me to offer you  Sir  sincere congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We have confidence in your ability to guide the work of our Assembly towards the success we expect.At this early juncture  allow me also to pay a tribute to your predecessor. Major General Joseph Garba  former Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  for the effective manner in which he conducted the business of the last session.The auspicious occasion afforded by this session of the General Assembly  marking the beginning of the last decade of the twentieth century  should be for all o£ us a unique moment  a moment to pause for reflection as we seek collectively to build a new and better future for mankind.The forty-fifth session is taking place amid epoch-making events throughout the world  tending towards restructuring of the international political order to attain durable international peace and stability  and mutual understanding and co-operation within the world community of nations. We are indeed beginning a new decade while standing on the threshold of a new world political order and poised to see the triumph of the vision embodied in the Charter of the United NationsThe collapse of the edifice of the cold-war era must be not only a challenge to us to rid ourselves of the remaining legacies of that period; it must also renew and inspire our determination to consolidate the emerging spirit of co-operation by translating the decisions of this body into practical action. Further  it must underscore the urgent need to enhance the effectiveness of our Organisation in its performance of its noble tasks. We note with deepest concern that  despite individual and collective efforts to rehabilitate the economies of the developing world  the socio-economic situation is worsening  particularly in Africa. The problem of external indebtedness still persists  and developing countries continue to be net exporters of resources to the developed countries and multilateral financial institutions. The structural adjustment programmes undertaken by most African countries under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund end the World Bank  in moat case  at heavy political and social cost  have yet to yield significant results. It is our belief that the recast Declaration on International Economic Co-operation  in particular the Revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries  adopted at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  will provide a framework  not only for the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade but also for a new world agenda on the issues of economic co-operation and development.The year 1990 marks the conclusion of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The final review of the programme during the current session of the Assembly must also critically examine the Measures that are needed for accelerated growth and development for Africa in the period that lies ahead.Marking the fortieth anniversary of the multilateral technical co-operation programme  1990 is a significant occasion for renewed international commitment to the ideals of multilateralism. The success of the historic Mission of the United Nations Development Programme in the developing countries has  in large measure  been attributable to the basic characteristics of its assistance  namely  responsiveness to the peculiar circumstances and priorities of the beneficiary countries  and the grant nature of its support programmes. the appeal to the donor community  especially the developed countries  to lend enhanced financial support to the United Nations Development Programme.Lesotho joins in the global consensus on the urgent necessity for combined international efforts to save our planet from the looming catastrophe resulting from the deterioration of the world's environment. A number of regional initiatives aimed at highlighting the need to give priority to environmental issues have been taken  including the Declaration by the African Heads of State  in July last year  on the African Year of the Environment. The most important initiative however remains the United Nations Conference ON Environment end Development to be convened in Brazil in 1992. It is our hope that that Conference will result in the adoption of a global plan of action for harmonizing human development activities and rational management of the environment.Lesotho remains convinced that the engine world political order of partnership and collective endeavour in confronting world problems cannot survive the turbulence of its environs unless it is based on the universal recognition of the primacy of law in international relations. For this reason  we attach great importance to the proclamation by this Assembly of the decade 1990-1999 as the United Nations decade of peace and international law.It this crucial juncture in the evolution of the history of mankind  we must increasingly lend our collective support to the efforts that are under way  in various parts of the globe  to build a future for Mankind in which the welfare and dignity of the human person takes centre stage.The international community would indeed have failed in its responsibility if it did not demonstrate its solidarity and practical support  both moral and material  for the peoples of Eastern Europe  Africa and Latin America that are engaged in the process of socio-economic transformation through democratisation  and consolidation of democratic institutions. These efforts can succeed only if due recognition is made of the realities obtaining in individual countries and the right of each nation to develop democratic institutions suitable to its own socio-economic environment.The linkage between democracy and development has long been established. It is against this background that we in Lesotho have now embarked on a firm initiative aimed at returning our country to full democratic rule by June 1992. To this end  a constituent assembly comprised of personalities representing virtually all shades of political persuasion in Lesotho has convened to work out a new constitution for Lesotho  using the 1966 Lesotho independence Constitution  which is based on multiparty democracy  as a working model.The issues of democracy alone should not  however  constitute the radius of our interest in the humanitarian sphere. We hail as constructive the recent convening of the World Summit for Children and the adoption of the World Declaration and Plan of Action for the child   which we believe will constitute a new framework for our collective efforts towards ensuring a better future for our children in the 19908 and beyond.Our concern with the deteriorating refugee situation  particularly in Africa and other developing parts of the world  has not diminished. In this regard  we derive great encouragement from the Declaration by the Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity in July this year  in which  among other things  they pledged their determination to make renewed efforts to eradicate the root causes of the refugee problem in Africa.While the political complexion of our globe is undergoing rapid change and a new climate of rapprochement and reconciliation is asserting itself  we cannot fail to observe that the now detente is still limited in scope and that the pace of progress in reducing the world's arsenals of war and mass destruction remains slow at best.We welcome the dramatic breakthrough made by the super-Powers on the issue of nuclear-arms reduction. Regrettably  we witness at the same time a dangerous escalation in the proliferation o£ both nuclear and chemical warfare technology. Added to this is the intensified race by countries  including developing countries  to accumulate conventional armaments. In the process  scarce resources needed for development are wasted. Lesotho particularly looks forward to the early conclusion of an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons  which we believe is one of the key issues facing the General Assembly at this forty-fifth session.Recent world developments have clearly demonstrated that there is a distinct need for an effective mechanism by which the security of small nations must be guaranteed under international law  ensuring not only their protection but also their ability to proper with a modicum of economic development for their survival. This underscores the necessity for a dual strategy by this world body  involving  on the one hand  the elaboration of international agreements on the security guarantees for these countries and  on the other  the establishment  under United Nations auspices  of a mechanism through which part of the resources released as a result of disarmament measures could be devoted to the economic and social advancement of all peoples  particularly those in the least developed countries.As the world steers off confrontational paths and extricates itself from regional conflicts  the southern African subregion has not lived in isolation from these positive influences. We have witnessed in Namibia the victory of the Namibian people in the struggle for their right to self-determination and the triumph of the principles of the United Nations Charter over the scourge of colonialism.Lesotho remains hopeful that all States Members of our Organization will continue to demonstrate the requisite solidarity and commitment in executing the remaining part of our collective responsibility to Namibia  which is to assist it with material resources needed for the consolidation of its independence. The international community and the people of South Africa have travelled a long way in their fight against apartheid. Only determination and conviction in the right to freedom could sustain a people in such a bitter and fateful struggle spanning a period of almost half a century. It is quite a long time since this Assembly declared apartheid a crime against humanity  and yet only last year this Assembly  in a special session  was still seized of the issue of its elimination.We therefore cannot but welcome the long-awaited positive developments that we see unfolding in South Africa today towards the elimination of apartheid through dialogue and peaceful negotiation. The commencement of dialogue between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South African Government at Groote Schuur  and later in Pretoria  was an epoch-making event  hopefully prefacing the start of substantive constitutional talks for the creation of a just and democratic South Africa.We commend Mr. Nelson Mandela and the leadership of the ANC for the dignity and statesmanship with which they have been able to advance the cause of peace  justice and freedom since their release and return from exile. Equally  we applaud their unflinching determination to leave to history the bitter memories of the past and to marshal their energies towards creating a new  democratic South Africa.We urge all anti-apartheid organisations  in particular the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  to co-ordinate their efforts and to reach a broad measure of consensus on strategies for a negotiated demise of apartheid. He recognise the urgent need for the International community to enhance financial support to these organisations to assist them to rebuild and consolidate their internal political structures within South Africa.It has to be conceded that the pillars of apartheid are still in place and that the road ahead is not only difficult but very uncertain. We have reason however  to believe that State President F.W. De Klerk has played a major role in creating a new climate of hope for South Africa  and for this he merits the encouragement of this body.Lesotho continues to be gravely concerned at the current wave of black inter-communal violence in South Africa which  if it remains unchecked  may delay the negotiation process towards the total eradication of apartheid.We commend the initiatives that are being taken by the Governments of Angola and Mozambique to solve their internal problems through peaceful dialogue. We are hopeful that the international community will continue to assist these efforts in the light of the prevailing spirit of international peace and co-operation.Concerning the situation in Liberia  we cannot but register our support for initiatives intended to bring an end to the civil war in that sister country.The Kingdom of Lesotho has always held the conviction that a lasting solution to the issue of Western Sahara can only be realized through direct negotiations between Morocco and the POLISAS10 Front. He continue to support all the positive efforts being made by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations  as well as the Non-Aligned Movement  towards finding a durable solution to the question of Western Sahara  particularly in seeking to ensure that necessary conditions for the holding of a national referendum prevail without any form of constraint.We welcome the growing realization by all the parties to the conflict in Cambodia that the time has now come to respond positively to the international efforts that are being made to assist in bringing about a negotiated and comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian problem. It is our hope that the newly-created Supreme National Council will live up to all our expectations in working for national reconciliation and an early restoration of peace and democracy. We are concerned at the impasse in the Middle East peace efforts and the escalating tension. The Assembly has the obligation to inject a new lease of life into the positive efforts long initiated by the United nations towards realising durable peace in the region. The principal goal should remain the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and the convening of the Middle East peace conference.The recent invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq has brought about a new and totally unacceptable situation in the Gulf area. We in Lesotho condemn this act as not only illegal and poisonous to the prevailing spirit of international detente  but also as a dangerous precedent for the continued existence and security of small States. Lesotho stands in full support of all the measures already taken by the Security CouncilIn our view  a lasting solution to the crisis can come about only through the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait end the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi occupation forces. It is our hope that the international co-operation that was elicited by this crisis can set the standards for the action that is expected of the international community in future in response to similar crises elsewhere.Being a small State ourselves  we admire the indomitable spirit of the Kuwaiti people in resisting the Iraqi aggression and resolutely continuing to maintain their nationhood.The unfolding new era of maturing international relations of peace and stability is  to a large measure  attributable to the increasing efficacy of the United Nations system. It is therefore befitting to seize this opportunity to express to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Peres de Cuellar  our feelings of renewed confidence in his tireless and praiseworthy efforts to promote and strengthen international peace and co-operation. We have just learned of the sad passing of the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates. On behalf of the people and Government of Lesotho and on my own behalf  I offer our sincere condolences."
"89",4274,"LUX",45,1990,"﻿Never since the Assembly began to meet have we witnessed in the space of one intercessional period so many important events and exceptional political and economic upheavals. The revolution that has just occurred has worked a fundamental transformation in the geopolitical make-up of Europe and of the world. The cold war is over. We stand at the beginning of a new era. While subscribing to the statement made last Tuesday by my colleague Gianni de Michelis  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy  who spoke on behalf of the twelve countries members of the Community  I should like today to deal with a few subjects that I feel are most significant.Never has an event so directly threatened peace as has the conflict that broke out only last month in the Gulf region. By its brutal invasion of Kuwait   a sovereign and independent country at dawn on 2 August Iraq flagrantly violated the fundamental principles of our Charter and in particular the principle of the non-use of force in the settlement of differences between States.The people of Luxembourg joined in condemning that unjustifiable and unacceptable act of aggression  one reminiscent of the darkest moments in their own history. On 6 August our Government banned any trade with Iraq and Kuwait. It decreed a freeze on both countries' financial assets. It has begun to provide emergency assistance to refugees in the countries most affected by the crisis and is participating fully in the efforts being made by the European Economic Community (EEC). Furthermore/ it will contribute to the financing of military operations conducted in the region by certain of its allies within the framework of the United Nations mandate.We welcome the unanimity and determination the international community has shown in expressing its disgust at this violation of international law. The speed with which the Security Council acted demonstrates that. The Council has developed a new ability to act. The unreserved implementation of Security Council resolutions should lead to a solution of the conflict through the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the release of all nationals of third countries. Meanwhile/ all Member States of the Organization must scrupulously implement the comprehensive and binding embargo against Iraq. Above and beyond the resolution of this conflict  what is at stake is respect for the principles of our Organisation and even  I would go so far as to say  its credibility. We must unite to deter anyone who might in the future be tempted to venture upon a similar adventure.The conflict has created extreme tension and has exposed the Gulf region  already sorely tested by eight years of war  to a terrible catastrophe. We must focus attention on the suffering of the people of Kuwait and of hundreds of thousands of foreign workers who have fled Iraq and Kuwait  most often in tragic circumstances. Incalculable economic damage has been inflicted  or Kuwait in the first instance and on the other countries in the region as well. The entire world has been effected. The Iraqi leaders have to assume a very weighty historical responsibility. After all  did they not play a decisive part 10 years ago in unleashing another war? Did they not without hesitation use chemical gases to eliminate in cold blood thousands of Kurds in their own country? They are intransigent and their only concern is to get us to accept a fait accompli. The constant violations of embassies in Kuwait are unprecedented in history. The detention of thousands of foreign nationals as hostages exceeds all acceptable norms.This violence  this cynicism remind us of the fascist practices that went on throughout the 1930s. Let us not forget that they were tolerated for too long and finally led the world into the Second World War. History will not pardon us if this mistake is made again. The United Nations must therefore emerge victorious from this test of strength.The restoration and the maintenance of peace naturally raise other questions. The first is that of security in the Gulf region  which has been jeopardised by the presence of dictatorial regimes that profess exclusive ideologies and that are backed up by powerful armies. This proves once again that the accumulation of military arsenals does not enhance security; quite the contrary. We should give fresh impetus to our efforts at disarmament and international arms transfers.Iraq's act of aggression cannot be justified by the impasse in which the question of Palestine finds itself  nor by the frustrations - that we understand - to which it has given rise in the Arab countries  particularly among the Palestinians. No linkage between the two questions can be allowed. The explosive character of the general situation in the Middle East forces us  nevertheless  to intensify our efforts to move towards the solution to the problem of Palestine. However  the collapse of the Berlin wall last November caught the imagination of the entire world. It was the death knell to the European and world order defined in Yalta and based on confrontation and ideological antagonism  accelerating the dynamic of change brought about by the policy of glasnost and perestroika. That event sent out shock waves to the borders of the most far-flung parts of Europe  and even beyond. One by one  the old non-representative regimes crumbled  giving way to the pressure from the man in the street and aspirations to liberty and democracy.For the first time in 40 years there were free elections in most countries of Central and Eastern Europe that led to the establishment of new  fully representative governments. Political and economic reforms of unprecedented magnitude were brought about to put an end to this dominating ideology and an ineffective economic system.I am delighted that Germany will be reunited in a few days. At long last the division of Europe has been ended. For the first time in their history all the peoples of Europe that share the same cultural heritage are able to organize their relations on a basis of common values  political pluralism  the periodic organization of free elections  the primacy of law  respect for human rights  and respect for the principles of the market economy.An historic occasion has thus been given to the continent of Europe  an occasion which should lead to the establishment of an era of peace and prosperity. It is up to the summit of the Group of 35 in Paris to usher in this new chapter in European history.However  to ignore relations with peoples on other continents would be for us Europeans a serious mistake. Mindful of their responsibilities in this decisive phase of its history  the European Community and its member States decided to speed up and deepen the process of unification. The single internal market will be achieved in 1992. It will be beneficial not only to the member countries but also to third countries. Two rounds of intergovernmental negotiations will get under way at the end of this year and will be continued during the nest quarter under the chairmanship of Luxembourg. The first round will seek to work out the final stages of economic and monetary union; the second will seek to strengthen the political structures of the Community and its member States.We believe that it is by this increasingly tight integration in all fields that the Twelve will build a solid nucleus for a future stable  peaceful European order for the future. But this integration cannot stop at the member countries of the European Community alone. This intra-community process is inseparable from a structural reinforcement among all the European States  a new economic space has to be established between the member countries of the Community and the member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Hew economic and trade agreements have been negotiated or will soon be negotiated between the Community and the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.We do not underestimate the difficulties that the transition from a bureaucratic centralized economy to a market economy occasions for all these countries. These are in addition to the frustration and insecurity felt by peoples who  more often than not  have to confront a worsening of the employment situation and their standard of living. It is in order to overcome these difficulties that the Twelve have taken the initiative  within the Group of 24  to set up major aid programmes immediately. Furthermore  the negotiation of association agreements of an entirely new type will highlight the new potentials of these countries. At a time when ideological rivalries of the past are giving way to new relationships based on a shared conception of society  on trust and a spirit of partnership  the maintenance of powerful armies has become irrelevant in Europe. The events of the past few months have quite naturally accelerated the disarmament movement. A first agreement will soon be concluded in Vienna on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe as veil as on a significant set of confidence- and security-building measures.At this very moment  foreign troops are leaving the territories of countries in which they were stationed against the will of the people. Seductions in troops and military expenditures - at times drastic - have been decided upon  or are being envisaged. Additional considerable funds could thus be used to solve social  educational  health  environmental and development problems.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  of which the States of Europe  the United States and Canada are participants  has played a fundamental role in the future of Europe. Its structure  its rules and its action should set an example for other regions of the world. The compelling aspiration o£ peoples to freedom and to control of their own destiny does not stop at the borders of Europe. In Asia  Latin America and Africa it is mobilising more and more people every day and encourages them to demand the same rights and freedoms. Thus we welcome the return to democracy in Chile  the holding of free elections in Nicaragua  and soon  it is to be hoped  with the assistance of the United Nations  in Haiti. The Namibian people  which is finally free  has chosen a pluralistic democratic system. Mozambique and Angola are preparing to follow suit. Others are giving serious thought to it. Likewise  it is with satisfaction that we are following developments in South Africa. Considerable progress has been made  thanks to the now policies of President de Klerk  has kept his promise by legalising the opposition movements and by releasing Nelson Mandela and lifting the state of emergency. We also take note of the promise of the Government to release all other political prisoners and to declare an amnesty for those in exile. We hope that negotiations with a view to a new constitution creating a united  democratic and non-racial South Africa will got under way soon.A month ago the five permanent members of the Security Council agreed to a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian problem. That agreement offers a real and unique chance for the restoration of peace in that country  too long torn apart by war. We must avoid any return to the practices of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot  which were responsible for the extermination of several hundred thousand Cambodians. I am delighted that  allowing the Djakarta meeting  the Cambodian parties were able to accept that agreement  which is to be ratified at the next Paris Conference.Neither democracy nor the market economy is a miraculous panacea. The painful experience of certain democracies undermined by violence  guerrilla war  socio-economic disorders and persistent under-development is proof of this. The establishment of political institutions guaranteeing pluralism and a democratic transition requires great effort and tenacity. Apart from the organisation of periodic fair legislative elections  structures must be established allowing for the real participation of all in development and an equitable distribution of national resources.There is close interaction between democracy and development. It is not possible to have one without the other; the one strengthens the other. At its special session in April the General Assembly reached an important consensus on the new contours of international economic co-operation. Using a more realistic  more balanced approach  it stressed  in particular  in a novel and encouraging way  the need for better use of human resources and respect for human rights. Mindful of the importance of increasing assistance for co-operation and development  my Government decided to double the volume of its aid by 1994.The Government of Luxembourg continues to attach great importance to respect for human rights. It is still concerned by the flagrant violations of those rights throughout the world. It is up to our Organisation to be increasingly vigilant in monitoring the strict universal implementation of existing instruments. Particular attention should be given to the rights of minorities  the rights of women and the rights of children.A problem of another kind is threatening the survival of mankind. I refer to the destruction of the natural environment  which makes life on Earth possible. The question of the protection of the environment is central to the daily concerns of us all. Major international conferences have been devoted to this question. They have all contributed to the preparation of the world Conference on the Environment and Development  which is to be held in Brazil in 1992. This Conference will seek to face up to the enormous challenges posed by damage to the biosphere and to ecosystems  and by degradation of the environment  the effects of demographic pressure  the depletion of resources  and the extinction of species. Tropical deforestation is increasing. The area affected this year is 17 million hectares  as against only 11.3 million hectares in 1980. The capacity of forests to absorb carbon dioxide  which is a function vital to our planet  is diminishing rapidly. The world population  which is now more than 5 billion  will increase by about 960 million this decade  compared to 842 million during the 1980s. How will we be able to feed these new people? The food capacity of the planet is already stagnant or is actually decreasing. In Africa and Latin America  per capita food consumption is now lower than it was 10 years ago. Each day about 250 000 children are born  but about 40 000 die of hunger or malnutrition. All countries represented here  especially the richest  must constantly try to remedy this scandalous situation. It is for the World Summit for Children to propose the necessary measures. Fresh impetus must also be given to population policies to be conducted at the national and international levels. The rich countries must help those with high birth rates to Implement these policies.The depletion of the ozone layer and the accumulation in the atmosphere of gases that produce the greenhouse effect could gradually increase temperatures  with the obvious disastrous consequences. Given this alarming picture  now is the time to take action. The European Community must establish an agency for the environment  and that agency must be open to other European countries also. The Ministers of 93 countries who met in London at the end of last June decided to go beyond the objectives o£ the Montreal Protocol and to ensure that the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions that destroy the ozone layer are stopped before the end of the century. I welcome in particular the agreement to establish a fund to assist the developing countries to acquire the necessary technology to stop these emissions.Energy efficiency and energy savings in general must be at the very heart of a new strategy  which is justified also by recent events in the Gulf. I hope that the next world conference on climate  to be held next November  will be able to agree on this objective and on guidelines for a framework convention on climatic change. This convention  with the necessary protocols  will be open for signature at the 1992 Conference. In this regard  the industrialised countries  which account for the consumption of 70 per cent of world primary energy and fossil fuels  must shoulder special responsibility. National accounting systems should be adapted to reflect  in the national product  the cost of conservation or replacement of natural resources  such as forests  water and fertile land. They should also reflect the devaluation of natural resources as non-renewable assets.I welcome the new spirit that we see in international relations. There is no doubt that this Organisation is a direct beneficiary. Its credibility and its ability to act have been reinforced to a considerable extent. Never has the United Nations been so sought after to resolve the world's problems.In Namibia  the United Nations concluded  in exemplary fashion  a process leading the Namibian people to independence. The flawless organisation of free elections was the key to that enormous success. In Central America the United Nations has contributed greatly to calming the situation by sending observers of the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ОGСА)  by monitoring elections in Nicaragua and by demobilizing contra forces.In the future it will have a special task in Cambodia  and after that perhaps in Afghanistan. In Western Sahara there is new hope that a referendum can be organised.The United Nations provides a framework for the needed intensification of international co-operation to fight drug trafficking and poverty and to protect the environment.The Organization's universality has been buttressed by the admission of Namibia and Liechtenstein  which I warmly welcome  and soon  I hope. South Korea.Certainly  we would not be at this point were it not for the Secretary-General and his decisive action. I wish once again to pay a tribute to his qualities and his tireless mediation efforts in the service of peace.I wish in conclusion warmly to congratulate you. Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I am sure you will guide our work to success."
"90",4347,"MAR",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  I take pleasure to extend to Ambassador de Marco  our congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that his ability and profound knowledge of international issues will lead our deliberations to a successful outcome. I would like to assure him of our full co-operation with him in the performance of his duties  all the more so because our two countries maintain and share common views within the framework of the Non-Aligned Movement and in the meetings of the countries of the Mediterranean basin.I should like also to pay tribute to Ambassador Joseph Garba for the excellent manner in which he conducted the work of the last session and express to the Secretary-General our highest appreciation for his tireless efforts for the settlement of the problems confronting our world and his sustained initiatives to strengthen opportunities for a constructive dialogue between States in the interests of peace and international security and the upholding of the principles of the Charter.It is also with particular pleasure that we welcome the presence of the delegation of the sister Republic of Yemen after the happy unification which brought back together its two parts.We would also like to welcome the new State of Namibia on the occasion of its admission to the Organisation following a lengthy struggle and we also congratulate the delegation of Liechtenstein on its admission.This  the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly takes place under extraordinary international circumstances and at the beginning of a historic new era in international relations. It is the first session after the end of the cold war. The threat of nuclear annihilation has receded. Extinction used to threaten a world which was torn apart by ideological antagonisms into two camps.We now witness a new international situation that has turned upside down the long-established concepts of international relations which prevailed for most of the twentieth century. This was unimaginable only a year ago. We cannot but express our profound satisfaction at the emergence of the beginning of a new era of accord that would spare humanity the horror of global destruction  put an end to the bitter struggle between East and West with all its negative repercussions on international relations and usher in a new era of world history.Notwithstanding  we would be justified in asking whether the positive results that have been achieved on the road of detente between East and West do mean the end of the problems of the overwhelming majority of the world's population and whether the developing world will really benefit from those developments? The question is: will the developing world continue to be on the side lines of international relations?Such questioning stems from the many fears bred by the mentality which still inspires the conduct of international relations  especially on the economic level. Moreover  problems continue to be dealt with in the same old way.However  we prefer to be optimistic. In our optimism  we hope that soon there will be a tendency towards economic co-operation and genuine co-ordination between all States of the North and the South and that this co-operation will materialise in the context of a new North-South dialogue which will be given special priority with a view to avoiding the further aggravation of the chronic crises of backwardness and their grave results.On the other hand  for about a year now  we have been witnessing the emergence of a more prominent United Nations political role which has continued to grow perceptibly La international relations. It even appears that this role is on its way towards the realisation of the objectives envisioned by the authors of the Charter at the Conference of San Francisco in 1945. While expressing our satisfaction at this positive development  we believe that  after a half century of its existence  the United Nations system needs a thorough re-examination. Today's world with its States  peoples  economy  beliefs  interests and priorities  is not the world which adopted the United Nations Charter in 1945. The number of members has risen from about 50 to 159; representation  which was initially limited  now embraces almost every corner of our planet. As a result  there have been several new political  economic and social situations and changes to which the United Nations should adjust if it is to function in the modern world and become a genuinely effective Organisation. That requires the introduction of comprehensive reforms in the Organisation's methods  structures and working procedures.  Who among us does not know that most United Nations resolutions go unheeded and remain neglected  or denies that regular and special General Assembly sessions produce nothing but neatly prepared documents that have no real practical content? That could prejudice the credibility and efficacy of the Organisation and acerbate tine critical situations that beset many of the world's regions. Therefore  we are duty-bound to remedy the situation earnestly and decisively so the United Nations may become the living conscience of mankind.The fact that principal centres of decision-making with a considerable influence on the life of the world's peoples and their political and social well- being operate outside the United Nations system has further weakened the organisation’s standing. That is a flagrant contradiction that we should overcome considering the establishment of a new order taking into account the legitimate interests of the world's population without preference or discrimination.In recent years  ш have been hoping for improvement in the situation of the developing countries  expansion of their economies and a rise in their standards of living and social conditions. We cannot but feel sorry to see developing countries becoming progressively poorer. How can it be otherwise when 11 more States were repeatedly added to the list of least developed countries? All this  in fact  stems from an inequitable economic environment that ignores the rights of the developing world.While Europe experiences fundamental changes which benefit its peoples  and while the prosperity and well-being of the other advanced peoples continue to grow  developing countries are heading towards deeper economic underdevelopment. Notwithstanding the special session of the General Assembly on recovery from the critical economic situation in Africa  that continent sinks deeper into the morass of its economic problems and teeters under the overwhelming burdens of poverty and debt.Morocco has always believed in the usefulness of constructive dialogue  and its foreign policy has always been pervaded by optimism. It is in this spirit that we hope for a favourable response on the part of the prosperous countries to the legitimate requests of the developing countries. Such a response would reflect the spirit of international detente and the positive impact it should have on the economies of the developed countries.In the midst of all the problems now facing the world and the world's strivings to find appropriate solutions for them  the Arab Maghreb countries have decided that the best way to face up to the challenges of our time is to act collectively through the establishment of a Maghreb union. The Kingdom of Morocco pays special priority to such common Maghreb action which aims at building a strong Maghreb entity on sound pillars of co-operation and positive  sincere co-ordination in all areas.There is no need to point out that the strong ties between the countries of the Arab Maghreb are not new. They are centuries-old ties rooted in the soil of a common past. We have always shared the same language  the same religion  the same history and will share the same destiny. More recently  this unity has been strengthened by a common armed struggle for liberation from the yoke of colonialism  a struggle which was aimed  on the political level  at building a united Arab Maghreb.If all such factors can be viewed as tributaries of the mainstream of Maghreb unity  the current era of major agglomerates requires that countries with close ties  such as the States of the Maghreb  should establish among themselves an integrated community and a system of co-ordination to enable them to face up to the challenges of the age.The emergence of the Arab Maghreb Union  whose legal foundations and institutions were established in the 1989 Marrakesh Treaty  was necessitated by the interests of the region's peoples at the national and international levels  especially with respect to their relations with the neighbouring States of the European Economic Community (EEC)  which are linked to the Arab Maghreb region by close historical and economic ties and important common interests.We are convinced that the many important accomplishments achieved on the path of this Union will increase and be consolidated thanks to the belief of the Maghreb peoples that political  economic and social progress is dependent on the Union and that their status and prosperity depend on common action.We have not the slightest doubt that the outcome of this process will reflect positively on the relations of brotherhood and solidarity among the States of the Maghreb. That will be in the interest of their peoples and to the benefit of regional and international peace and security.Morocco is also closely linked to other parts of the Arab world by strong ties of religion  blood  kinship  history and common destiny. Consequently  being sensitive to any event that takes place in that world  it has always endeavoured to contribute to mapping out a common Arab destiny. It is no surprise  therefore  that Morocco takes great interest in Arab affairs  as witnessed by our hosting of a great many Arab summits and other meetings. The Arab world is today experiencing one of the gravest and darkest crises in its modern history as a result of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi armed forces and the developments that have ensued.Since the early 19808  the Arab Gulf region has been in the grip of instability as a result of the Iraq-Iran war and its negative effects on the security of the Gulf. The world breathed easier when  in keeping with Security Council resolution 598 (1988)  that war ended on 18 July 1988. The Arab world then began to look with optimism to the re-establishment of security in the region and to a better future in inter-Arab relations.Throughout that period  Morocco played to the full its positive Arab role which stems from its Arab policy that puts principles over interests and which is motivated by a sincere desire to establish genuine Arab co-operation through an effective solidarity that is free from any political  economic or any other ambition. The late King  His Majesty Mohammed V  summed up the fundamentals of Moroccan Arab policy in those few  eloquent words addressed to the Middle East countries during his visit to Lebanon in 1960: ""Our closeness derives from our being far away from each other.""However  calm and peace had no sooner returned to the Gulf region then the situation deteriorated once again as regional relations were darkened by a border dispute between Iraq and Kuwait  to which the Arab States  as well as Arab mediators and the countries members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  turned their attention with a view to containing and confining it.In fact  a partial solution to the dispute was worked out at Geneva within the framework of OPEC. Arab action was then mobilised to find a solution to the remaining aspects of the dispute  in particular at the Jeddah meeting between the two parties on 1 August 1990  which led to an agreement to pursue the dialogue at a later time. The Arab world and the international community as a whole were startled by the Iraqi military invasion of the State of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 and by our Iraqi brethren's subsequent annexation of that country.Morocco  which has always maintained and which continues to have strong fraternal ties with its sister countries of Iraq and Kuwait  and which has maintained relations with then based on mutual respect  cannot but express its regret that this should have happened. Kuwait is a sovereign State  a member of the League of Arab States and of the United Nations. This is  therefore  an inadmissible fait accompli that is contrary to international law - all the more so because our Iraqi brethren did not resort to the ordinary means of settling disputes in dealing with their differences with Kuwait. That is to say  those problems should have been addressed within the framework of the charter of the League of Arab States  through Arab arbitration or mediation.That action triggered a grave and unprecedented crisis  one that generated among the States of the region a real anxiety about their future  compelled them to take exceptional measures and  in exercise of their sovereignty  to appeal for Arab and foreign help. Subsequently  the Arab world found itself in a very embarrassing deadlocks the problem had acquired international dimensions and foreign naval fleets and armed forces pouted into the region.Morocco is most sincerely eager and hopeful to find a way of reaching agreement between its brethren. We remain convinced that finding an Arab solution is the soundest way to overcome the crisis  for Arab wisdom has in the past succeeded in resolving major crises in the Arab world. Against this backdrop  an Arab mini-summit was held in Eabat on 19 September 1990 between His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan  His Majesty the King of Morocco and His Excellency President Benjedid of Algeria to seek a solution to the crisis. This was yet another Arab effort to resolve the crisis. In this connection  Morocco wishes to reiterate its readiness to effectively contribute to any effort that aims at finding a peaceful solution to this problem.If good intentions prevail and the political will is there we can put an end to this perilous elide towards war by finding a solution based on Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait's territory  respect for international law and the re-institution of the legal Government of Kuwait  while considering the vital interests of both parties. Within such a framework  all legitimate claims could be examined.On the other hand  we should not ignore the relationship between this crisis and the unstable situation that prevails in the Middle East or the continued turmoil in the region since the end of the Second World War. The region has continued to be the arena of a military and political conflict and a combat area into which  because of the Arab-Israeli conflict  the most modern armaments have been poured from East and West. The present circumstances may provide an opportunity to reflect on appropriate solutions to all Middle East problems and  in the first instance  to the Palestinian question  which  without a prompt and equitable settlement  will continue to be a clutch of time-bombs that are primed to explode and threaten international peace.More than 23 years have elapsed since Israel occupied the Arab occupied territories. Consistently  throughout that period  the international community and the United Nations have failed  owing to Israel's intransigence  to implement the resolutions} they have adopted with a view to bringing that occupation to an end. In this regard  Morocco has exerted countless efforts over the years to contribute to finding a solution to the Middle East problem. In fact  the historic summit of Fes was held on Moroccan soil in 1982. The outcome of that summit was a much lauded practical Arab plan for the settlement of the problem. The extraordinary Arab summit meeting held at Casablanca last year  reasserted the commitment of the Arab countries to a peaceful settlement on the basis of international law. It also called for the need to convene an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  along with all the parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  to find solutions on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 333 (1973) and all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. However  this striving after settlement has not progressed a single step forward because of the lack of any Israeli political will to move in that direction  Israel's rejection of the very idea of an international conference and its denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The situation has been complicated further by the immigration of thousands of Soviet Jews to the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories. This has just started and the number of the immigrants is expected to reach 1 Million.One cannot but ask oneself where all these people are going to live and whether it is not the intention of Israel to settle them in the occupied territories at the expense of the legitimate inhabitants and thereby create a new fait accompli on the ground that would obviate the possibility of adopting any proposed solution.If this new situation continues  its serious consequences could not but trigger a new and major crisis in the Middle East region such as the region has never seen.In view of ell this  it is no wonder that the Palestinian people's intifadah which is about to end its third year  goes on unabated. It expresses the Palestinian people's determination to wrest their inalienable legitimate rights' to self-determination and the establishment of their own independent State on their own soil like any other people in the world that has acceded to independence and sovereignty over the past few decades.Because of the consequences of the Middle East situation  our sister country  Lebanon  became the bloody arena of political and inter-communal splits such as the world has never seen  after having been once a cradle of brotherhood and coexistence between all communities  religions and creeds.Morocco  as a co-chairman of the Tripartite Committee  is happy to see the Taif accords being implemented. The best proof that the complete and effective implementation of the plan and the steps deriving front it are conducive to security  civil peace and national concord in this wounded sister country is embodied in the recent decision by the Lebanese parliament to reform the Lebanese State's structures.Morocco  being part of Africa  takes great interest in the affairs of that continent and actively contributes to every endeavour to guide its steps and map out its future. During the past session  the continent witnessed a number of significant positive political developments  such as the independence of Namibia  last March. My country welcomed that event and wished the brotherly Namibian people progress and happiness in the exercise of their regained national sovereignty.Morocco has equally welcomed the recent developments in South Africa towards a new system wherein every trace of apartheid would be eradicated. Those developments were initiated by the release of the militant Nelson Mandela  the lifting of the ban that was imposed on the African National Congress and other political parties and limiting the scope of the emergency laws.In this regard  Morocco would encourage the Government of President de Klerk in pursuing further the policy of dialogue and reform  provided that policy leads to the eradication of every trace of the apartheid system in South Africa.Morocco has always been one of the most fervent believers in the virtues of dialogue and the need to search for solutions by peaceful means. Hence  Morocco has been a meeting ground for those who favour the wisdom of exchanging views and mutual understanding between the parties to any conflict. In this context  Morocco cannot but voice its profound satisfaction at the decision of the two sister countries  Libya and Chad  following their recent summit meeting at Rabat  to submit their territorial dispute to the International Court of Justice. In our view  it is a wise decision  which Morocco has been advocating for a long time.We also hope for concord  harmony and national reconciliation in the sister country  Angola. Morocco has worked for this with the agreement of the parties concerned and will continue to work in that direction in the hope that the parties will be able to reach solutions that would ensure unity  progress and prosperity for the people of Angola. This is an end that Morocco will continue to work for.As for the dispute between Mauritania and Senegal  this is a painful disagreement which deeply touches the Kingdom of Morocco; the parties to the conflict are brothers and friends that have the closest ties with my country  based on a common history or ties of religion  blood and kinship.From the first day of the dispute  Morocco acted to mitigate its impact on the populations of the two countries with an air lift between the two capitals  Houakchott and Dakar  to evacuate victims. Moreover  Morocco was the first country to take initiatives to contain the dispute and contribute to finding a speedy and just solution thereto. To this end  it chaired a delegation of the Arab Maghreb Union countries  which tried to contain the conflict and reconcile the two parties.Despite the difficulties in the way of settlement  Morocco  which has always favoured dialogue and understanding  continues to be ready to play its role anew towards reconciliation and for the return to serenity in the relations between the two sister countries.Morocco welcomes the positive developments that have taken place recently in Asia  in particular the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  the beginning in the Korean peninsula of a useful dialogue between North and South and the agreement reached in the United Nations Security Council for settling the problem of Cambodia. Morocco equally welcomes the return of concord among the Latin American countries  especially those of Central America  since my country might be considered the closest Arab country to Latin America  in view of its historical and cultural ties with the region. Morocco in happy to see Latin America find its way to understanding and progress and declares its willingness to widen the field of co-operation and increase the existing contacts with those countries and their Governments.Morocco is the closest Arab and African country to Europe. This geographical closeness has always made it necessary for Morocco to follow with great attention what goes on in Europe  especially since many of its fundamental interests are related to that continent.Therefore  Morocco has been following with the greatest interest the radical changes that have been taking place recently on the political  economic and social levels in Europe. Those are reshaping the history of that continent. In this regard  Morocco welcomes especially the unification of the two Germanys and the commitment of most Eastern European countries to pluralistic democracy and economic freedom. Morocco was quick to voice its satisfaction at those developments  and even insisted on consolidating and promoting those developments by contributing to the fund of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which finances the reconstruction of the economies of those countries.Morocco has also followed  with great interest  the developments that have been taking place in the European Economic Community (EEC) in the direction of a single market  as a prelude to political union. It goes without saying that Morocco's many significant historical ties with the countries of the EEC justify Morocco's great sensitivity with regard to those developments  which are bringing blessings to the peoples of the EEC  increasing their prosperity and raising their level of development. As a result  there is naturally a situation of improved security  stability and progress for all Europe  and for the north coast of the Mediterranean in particular.Morocco  which is working to consolidate its relations of friendship  co-operation and good-neighbourliness with its European neighbours  expresses the wish to see the blessings of this prosperity extend to the entire Mediterranean basin from north to south.One of the items on this session's agenda is the so-called question of Western Sahara. This item  as we know  is directly related to the fundamental interests and destiny of the Kingdom of Morocco Regardless of those considerations  Morocco has responded to the efforts and good intentions aimed at finding a solution to this conflict within the framework of the United Nations. Therefore  Morocco has agreed in principle to the Secretary-General's proposal  made in August 1988 as part of his good offices  in order to reach a settlement of that problem. After welcoming this initiative  Morocco has pursued the dialogue with the Secretary-General in this regard. Since then  the Secretary-General has visited Morocco many times  where he has had constructive and positive discussions. This has helped him to pursue further his efforts. Morocco has spared no effort in facilitating his mission and co-operating sincerely with him in search of a lasting solution to this problem as soon as possible.In this regard  a new development has taken place recently when the Secretary-General submitted proposals for a practical settlement. On 30 July 1990  His Majesty King Hassan 11 sent a letter to the Secretary-General clarifying Morocco's position on the proposals. Morocco views the future with great hope and optimism  and remains guided by the same spirit as in the past regarding the creation of the best conditions which would lead to the desired settlement. The delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco wishes to underline  in this forum  Morocco's commitment to a continuing constructive dialogue with the Secretary-General and its readiness to sincerely co-operate with him.All through the years of this 20th century  mankind has witnessed great events which influenced the quality of life on our planet either positively or negatively. On could therefore say that  as of now  the 20th century  with its good and evil  has virtually ended  and the thoughts of mankind are beginning to turn towards the 21st century with optimism. It augurs well that everybody is getting ready to welcome the new century with a positive spirit  marked with optimism  in order to face up to the fundamental challenges. That is unavoidable if we are to start the long march towards the happiness of mankind.The most important of these challenges are the eradication of underdevelopment in the least developed countries  a new upsurge in human development  and ridding contemporary human societies of all the diseases and all the psychological  cultural and moral crises which beset humanity. We continue to hope to be able to face up to those challenges in order to create a world that is worthy of mankind and to bequeath to the coming generations a social and moral inheritance and a civilisation which matches the unprecedented dazzling scientific and technological achievements of this century."
"91",4441,"MDG",45,1990,"﻿As we express our appreciation of the way in which Major General Joseph Garba of Nigeria guided the work of the General Assembly as its President at the forty-fourth session  and as we pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and all his associates for their tireless work in the cause of international peace  allow me  an behalf of the delegation of Madagascar  to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session.We welcome to the General Assembly the 160th Member of our Organization - the Principality of Liechtenstein - as well as the State of Yemen and the reunited Germany  each of which is represented by a single delegation. In this year  which marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter  the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar wishes to make a point of expressing once again its dedication to the purposes and principles of our Organization - notably  the sovereign equality of States  the primacy of international law  the peaceful settlement of disputes and avoidance of resort to the use of force or the threat of the use of force in international relations  and respect for the rights of individuals and of peoples.Faithful to our position  we have always pleaded the sacred cause of the liberation of oppressed peoples the world over - something that must lead to the eradication of colonialism and of racial discrimination in all its forms. We have always fought for preservation of the identity of our people  refusing to become embroiled in bloc politics and zones of influence  notwithstanding the great sacrifices that that has entailed. But Madagascar's intangible principles  if they have strengthened its policies within the concert of nations  certainly have not facilitated its economic recovery  because its truly non-aligned  though committed  position did not further its co-operation with the wealthy countries.In the same vein  we have been active in the cause of regional co-operation  South-South co-operation and more equitable international economic relations.The increasing understanding between the two super-Powers continues to have positive effects so far as certain regional conflicts inherited from the cold war are concerned. After 45 years of division the two German States celebrated their unification on 3 October. On this road  rich in promises of peace and prosperity  they were preceded several months earlier by the two Yemens.Elsewhere in the world  long-standing antagonists are rediscovering the virtues of negotiation. On the Korean peninsula  the meeting between the two Prime Ministers marks an important step in the process of bringing about a peaceful settlement of the question of Korea - a step that will contribute to the reinforcement of stability in that part of the world. In Cambodia acceptance by the various parties of a comprehensive political settlement plan adopted by the Security Council  one which entrusts a central role to the United Nations  lends renewed impetus to the negotiation process. It can only be hoped that the Paris Conference on Cambodia will resume and will work out and conclude a comprehensive peace agreement.Namibia's accession to independence  followed by its admission to the United Nations  has given considerable impetus to the quest for a negotiated settlement of conflicts ravaging southern Africa.In South Africa we welcomed the freeing of Nelson Mandela  as well as the opening of negotiations between the South African Government and the African National Congress  which led to the issuance of a joint declaration envisaging significant measures likely to break the long-standing deadlock in the political situation. We express the hope that the process thus set in train will lead to the complete dismantling of the apartheid system  making possible at last the establishment of a democracy free from distinctions of race  within & united and non-racial South Africa endowed with a Constitution guaranteeing the legitimate rights of all the people living in the Republic of South Africa.We have likewise been following with interest the talks between the various opposing parties in Angola and in Mozambique. We hope that these negotiations will succeed in bringing succour to the peoples of these two countries suffering from the ravages of civil war.In Western Sahara the settlement plan embodied in Security Council resolution 658 (1990) should facilitate the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the Saharan people  a referendum organized under the aegis of the United Nations and in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity. Can one deduce from this quick overview of the international situation that the improvement in East-West relations is the panacea for all the difficulties? In other words  does the thaw in the relations between the two super-Powers mean that we have found an across-the-board political solution to the problems of the world? So far as we are concerned this is not obvious.As a matter of fact  while the analysis we have just carried out is tempting and attractive  bringing with it a glimmer of hope  the destabilizing effect of certain regional crises and  above all  the gravity of the economic problems dictate that we tread warily and maintain some reservations. Hone of the processes under way has yet run its course or become totally irreversible. It is thus up to our Organisation to consolidate all these processes; otherwise  our efforts will have been in vain. All these problems must be resituated within a more general framework based on a comprehensive approach and a better understanding of international solidarity.Within that context we have been following with disquiet developments in the tragic situation in the Gulf region since the inadmissible invasion of the State of Kuwait by Iraqi armed forces. President Didier Ratsiraka  in an official message dated 3 August addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  said the following on this subject:""... we cannot but consider  in the name of the universal principles of international law  the invasion of Kuwait  like any infringement of the territorial integrity of a sovereign State  regardless of the reasons cited to justify such an offence.""  (A/4S/379. p. a)The immediate consequences of that act of aggression are stark indeed. The people of Kuwait are enduring the harsh conditions of an occupation or are in exile. The Iraqi people  having barely emerged from eight years of war  are liable for the proving ground for the most sophisticated weaponry and thus may be reposing themselves to annihilation. Hundreds of thousands of nationals of third countries have overnight become refugees and find themselves in dire straits. The hopes of the peoples of the third world  who had expected to benefit from the ""peace dividends""  are fading as they face the possibility of a world-wide economic recession.The embargo and the drying up of oil supplies now needed for the sophisticated armada in the Gulf region  and the erratic increases in petroleum- and petroleum- product prices further exacerbates the difficulties facing third-world countries in their development efforts and deflects industrial countries' aid from its intended targets.The concentration of military forces in that ultra-sensitive area increases the dangers of a conflagration with incalculable consequences.Given the fact that the area of the Persian Gulf and that of the Gulf of Aden fall within the geographical definition of the northern part of the Indian Ocean  our analysis on the convening of an international conference under the aegis of the United Nations to designate the Indian Ocean a zone of peace remains as pertinent as ever. Some people  basing themselves on excessive optimism and the refusal to hold the Colombo Conference  have tried to make us believe that resolution 2832  on designating the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  has become obsolete and does not take into account the change in the climate of international relations.In the light of developments  there are real risks of confrontation in that area. That is why we ask all the parties concerned to display maximum restraint in order to give diplomatic efforts a chance  and to see to it that wisdom prevails over the logic of war. Indeed  the current crisis must bring into play the responsibility of each State  whether it acts individually or as part of a community. This responsibility must first and foremost be base upon the logic of peace  particularly since provocations fro· a variety of sources in the region would become a formidable and even irreversible factor for confrontation.Current events are further complicating an already extremely complex situation in the Middle East. In our view it is time for the international community to come to grips with all the ramifications of a settlement of the so-called Middle East question  a source of instability and of the denial of the fundamental rights of peoples who should be able to live there in peace and security.The convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the aegis of the United Nations in which the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) must participate on an equal footing constitutes the appropriate framework for settling the Palestine question. The swift pace at which the Security Council responded to the Iraqi aggression demonstrated that the Council can  when it wishes  display unity and firmness. None the less  it must be acknowledged that there are many cases of flagrant violation of international law that have gone unpunished.It is difficult to rid oneself of the impression that the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular are used by their most influential Members when it suits their interests. The concept of the right of veto held by the permanent members of the Council is increasingly perceived as being antithetical to the concept of democracy within the world Organisation - a concept that is indispensable to the existence of support on the part of the majority of its Members now that the historic framework that gave rise to its institution has been superseded.In the final analysis  it is appropriate for us to take a fresh look at the role of the United Nations and the Security Council within the framework of the sort of democracy everyone is espousing around the world and the sort of democratisation they are seeking to impose while ignoring the national identity of a particular State. It would be appropriate to define a framework within which international solidarity and genuine political co-operation night become manifest and thus we night envisage a system of consensus for settling all such problems.The optimism that has been created by the improvement in the international political climate is being weakened by an absence of simultaneous progress in the economic sphere. It is not certain that the hopes for political peace can endure so long as the world economy remains fragile and subjected to fluctuations that we night qualify as  crisogenic - if you will pardon the neologism. Indeed while promising prospects  seem to be opening up among the major Powers  it must be recognised that the overwhelming majority of people are still living in conditions of malnutrition  hunger and poverty.Ever since the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly the members of the international community have been committed to promoting growth and development on the global level and to guaranteeing to poor countries the conditions and the means for their development. Furthermore  a promise has been made to resume dialogue from a political perspective.We support the proposal to convene a meeting of the Economic and Social Council at the ministerial level. Indeed we still feel uneasy inasmuch as the structural changes under way in the countries of Eastern Europe will involve e major revision of the allocation of the resources earmarked for expenditure tied to aid for development budgets along with a modification of the structure of world economic activity.The fact is that most third world countries have courageously undertaken reforms aimed at establishing the political and social conditions necessary for re-launching economic growth  notably in conjunction with structural adjustment programmes. These programmes must take into account  not only the economic and social realities of each State  but also those political choices that are rightly to be made by our peep?  in the exercise of their freedom.The political transformations that have taken place in the countries of Eastern Europe have been too hastily attributed to political liberalisation. But is that sufficient reason to envisage the transfer of a phenomenon that is so narrowly limited in time and space to the States of the South with a view to prescribing new strings to be attached to aid  including what is called readiness for democracy? By all means let them call for the bringing about of a climate of confidence in third world countries; yes  but why refuse to trust the capacity for political creativity of States by prescribing an alien model for then? That in why we feel it in urgent to appeal to the international community for respect to be shown for our identity within the context of sound and healthy competition.Our world in undergoing a complete change. A tempestuous era in dawning  because times of change are the most tumultuous. There in an awareness that one world has come to an end and there in an impatience to reap the fruits of that change immediately. We must therefore exercise care and prudence as we face the future  in order to avoid being overtaken or even overwhelmed by it.All the events that have taken place over the last several years  in particular the rapid pace of change in the countries of the East  heighten the risk of having attention diverted from the South to the detriment of the South. It is all very well to proclaim that nothing has changed in terms of aid to third world countries  but in the light of the reactions we are witnessing today we cannot but voice doubts and fears. Thus in the face of panic in international relations we make an appeal for shared solidarity between the North and the South  and among those of us in the South  thus ensuring the future for mankind."
"92",4479,"MDV",45,1990,"﻿I have much pleasure in extending to you  Sir  my warm congratulations and those of the members of the Maldives delegation on your election as President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your able guidance the deliberations of this session will be concluded in a successful manner. I should also like to convey our sincere appreciation to your predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba  for having done an excellent job in presiding over the Assembly during the past year. I note here with particular pleasure the significance of his visit to the Maldives earlier this year in spite of his very busy schedule.I wish to express my country's deep appreciation also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his dedicated efforts to uphold the noble objectives of the United Nations. We wish him well in all his endeavours  On behalf of the Maldives; it gives me great pleasure to welcome the admission of Namibia to the United Nations  which it truly deserves after its long and hard-fought battle for independence. We are confident that independent Namibia will make a most positive contribution to the work of the Organization. I should also like to welcome our newest Member  the Principality of Liechtenstein  and congratulate it on having gained the sovereign independent status it enjoys today.This year the Maldives is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the attainment of full political independence. I do not  therefore  consider it irrelevant to reflect a little on the achievements we have been able to make during the past 25 years. From the day we became an independent nation  we embarked on a determined path to overcome the triple menace of poverty  illiteracy and disease. With genuine hard work in the face of tremendous odds  the Maldives has been able to register significant strides in social and economic development. In education  we have now achieved a literacy level of over 95 per cent  and more than 80 per cent of our young children have access to schools. The improved standard of health is illustrated by the remarkable drop in the infant mortality rate from 120 per thousand live births in 1977 to 43 per thousand in 1989 and the rise in the average life expectancy from 46.5 years in 1977 to 64 years in 1988. Economically  too  we have made very good progress. With planned investment in the important sectors of fisheries  tourism  transportation and telecommunications  our per capita income has become more than six times that of pre-independence levels  and we have maintained an economic growth rate of 10 per cent per annum for the past 10 years. I wish to express the deep gratitude of the people of the Maldives to all our development partners  the United Nations and its agencies for their generous support in realizing such encouraging results.The establishment of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in 1985 opened new vistas of regional co-operation  reflecting the shared objectives of the South Asian nations. The Maldives is actively participating in the efforts to enhance peace  stability and security in our region. The Government and people of the Maldives are looking forward to the fifth meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation  to be held at Mali in November this year  to provide the opportunity to move ahead with our joint programmes aimed at enhancing the quality of life of the peoples of the seven nations.The Maldives has always endeavoured to contribute its modest share to the untiring efforts of the United Nations in promoting the principles of peace and international co-operation. In a world characterized by tension and conflict  we firmly subscribe to the universally accepted principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the affairs of sovereign States by other States.Thus it is with deep concern that we view the current crisis in the Gulf region. We reiterate our firm conviction that there could be no justification for the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any State by another. Peace and stability cannot be achieved anywhere in the world unless we respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. The Maldives urges the Iraqi Government to respond positively to the call of the Security Council and the international community to withdraw its troops from Kuwait immediately  allowing the people of Kuwait to restore normalcy in their country under the leadership of the legitimate Government of Kuwait  headed by the Emir  His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. We support all Security Council resolutions on the issue and call on Iraq to release all foreign nationals and to respect the immunity of the diplomatic missions in Kuwait.While we urge that a peaceful solution be found to the Gulf crisis  we reaffirm our commitment to giving our whole-hearted support to those who seek to eliminate the threat of war. We welcome the new  and indeed historic  trend seen in international relations today; a change which we hope will strengthen the principles of peace and peaceful coexistence. All those who advocate freedom and justice would salute with us the slow but unmistakable move by the super-Powers to reduce their nuclear-weapon arsenals  and the development of positive ties between the East and the West. The bringing down of the Berlin Wall and the imminent unification of Germany are clear examples of such positive developments. These provide the right setting for future efforts to strengthen peace and security in the world. We are  indeed  heartened by the recent successful achievements by the United Nations in this regard. The ending of the Iraq-Iran war  the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and the attainment of independence by Namibia have brought us fresh hopes for universal peace.At this juncture let me reiterate our support for the unification of Korea through peaceful dialogue. Notwithstanding our support for that objective  however  let me also express our support for the Republic of Korea in its efforts to seek membership in the United Nations.The Palestinians have been denied their legitimate right to self-determination for too long. The heroic intifadah carried out by the Palestinian people in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is a courageous expression of the will and determination of the Palestinian people to regain their inalienable rights. The exodus of Soviet Jews has added to the already worsened situation. Israel continues to establish illegal settlements in the occupied territories. My country firmly believes that if peace is to be achieved in the Middle East a comprehensive solution to the Palestine question has to be found based on the right of the Palestinian people to independence and self-determination and to establish their homeland on their national soil. It is time that a more concerted universal effort is made to attain these objectives. In this context  we support the convening of an international conference for the settlement of the Palestinian question. The black people of South Africa are continuously being harassed by the white minority regime. While congratulating the United Nations on its commendable efforts in exerting pressure towards the release of Nelson Mandela  we express our conviction that further pressure needs to be exercised on the minority regime if the international community really wants to see the end of the suffering of the black people. Apartheid should be dismantled in its entirety. It is the responsibility of the United Nations and other international and regional organizations and indeed all Governments to work towards the elimination of racism  which we believe  is not only a crime against the black people of South Africa but a crime against humanity.Although the world may be prepared to reduce some of its more destructive weapons and the international community may rejoice at the improving relations between the greater Powers of the world  for many small but sovereign States  like the Maldives  there exists a serious predicament to which a long-term solution needs to be found: that of the protection and security of our States and the elimination of the risk to our sovereignty and independence. The growing danger of international mercenaries has increased the vulnerability of small States to external threats. The armed aggression against the Maldives in 1988 is just one example of the alarming proportions this international menace has now assumed. Some may regard the event as insignificant from a global perspective  but we cannot ignore the fact that these international soldiers of fortune have in recent years threatened the peace and stability of many States. The fact is that today international mercenaries are better organized  better financed and better equipped with sophisticated weapons. Unless immediate and firm action is taken against them  they will remain a significant danger to the world in general.Small States are not in a position to sacrifice their hard-earned resources to defend themselves against such threats. Their economies are too fragile to allow them to divert funds to build up their military capability. Self-help cannot be the only answer. Efforts have to be undertaken by the international community as a whole under the aegis of the United Nations and other international and regional organizations. The United Nations Charter envisages some mechanisms for the protection of the territorial integrity and political independence of States from external threats  but those mechanisms are far from adequate. United Nations resolution 44/51 on ""Protection and security of small States""  submitted by the Maldives and adopted at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  is indeed a vital step taken in the right direction to remedy the situation. The Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries provides an even greater opportunity to challenge the acts of terrorism and mercenarism.The economic issues that plague the third-world countries today demand urgent attention. Developing countries are caught in a vicious circle of poverty  stagnation  an overpowering debt burden and other negative trends that perpetuate their underdevelopment. Structural handicaps such as poorly diversified economies weighted by a narrow resource base are not the only explanation for the dismal performance of these countries during the past decade. The reduction of the aid flow from the developed countries  which has marred their development efforts  has caused them much disappointment. The Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s  adopted by the first United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in 1981  called upon the developed countries to contribute 0.15 per cent of their gross national product for official donor assistance to the least developed countries. However  only eight of the rich nations reached the target and the average contribution for official development assistance amounted only to 0.9 per cent. The least developed countries has been increasingly marginalized in the world economy and their share in world exports has decreased to a mere 0.3 per cent in 1988 as compared to 1.4 per cent in I960. The least developed countries' foreign debt has also increased from $35.8 billion in 1982 to $69.3 billion in 1988. The bottom line is that the economic situation of the developing countries has further deteriorated and that the gap between the rich and the poor has further widened during the last decade.It is now obvious that economic repercussions of the Gulf crisis will seriously exacerbate the unfavourable trends in the world economy  which  of course  will be felt more severely by small nations. The Maldives is already experiencing grim economic hardships with the steep rise in oil prices affecting the key industries in our foreign exchange earnings  fisheries and tourism. If the crisis remains unsolved  our fragile balance-of-payments situation will be further strained. We strongly suggest that the international community strengthen the commitment to assist the developing countries in order to revitalize their economies and improve the quality of such assistance by making it better adapted to the real needs of the recipient countries. The elimination or substantial reduction of tariffs to guarantee favourable terms of trade  increasing grant aid to help the diversification of their economies  creating a favourable climate for more foreign investment and allowing freer resource flow are measures that are urgently required to correct the situation.The message in fact is that it would be impossible for the developing countries alone to reverse the lingering inertia in their economies no matter how well they determine their priorities. It is true that the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris earlier this month  clearly defined five priorities. Among these  however  the development of human resources  the ending of environmental degradation and the strengthening of the diversified productive sector are but some areas in which no significant improvement is possible unless complementary commitments from their development partners can be mobilized.	.Allow me to draw your attention to another matter of key concern to us  an issue to which I have been resolutely seeking help from the international community. I refer to the predicted global warming and sea-level rise  which may endanger the very survival of my island nation. We are trying to do what we can to combat this potential threat. At the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government held in Kuala Lumpur in October 1989  the Maldives proposed that the Commonwealth make every possible effort to expedite the drafting of the framework convention on environment on which the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have been collaborating for some time. The initial report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will be considered at the second World Climate Conference to be held in Geneva from 29 October to 7 November this year  and it is hoped that the final convention will be adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992.A Small States Conference on Sea-Level Rise was hosted by the Maldives last year  and the Male Declaration on Global Warming and Sea-Level Rise  which was adopted at the Conference  underscored the urgency of the problem and identified many areas of possible international co-operation in this field. As called for in the Male Declaration  an action group has been established to co-ordinate a joint approach on the issues of climate change  global warming and sea-level rise  and to pursue and follow up on global and regional response strategies. The group - comprising representatives from the Mediterranean  the Caribbean  the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions - is scheduled to meet in Male early next year.There is  however  a limit to what the small low-lying States can do. We need international help. In this multipolar world  where interdependency has become a key element  we believe that it is not just the responsibility of the nations threatened by sea-level rise to take preventive measures. We remain convinced that it is also the duty of those States whose race for development over many years had contributed to global warming  ozone depletion  acid rain and tropical deforestation to reverse the existing situation. We cannot accept that economic development has to be achieved at the expense of our environment.The Maldives calls upon the industrialized nations to take urgent measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and to adopt environmentally compatible technology. We urge them to assist the developing countries to implement similar measures. It is our earnest hope that the world community will heed our voice - that of low-lying States - and save us from the ignominy of becoming environmental refugees.Our children are the most vulnerable sector of our societies to environmental hazards. They are the ones most likely to suffer from the deterioration of our ecosystems. Thousands of children die every year from environment-related diseases such as diarrhoea and upper respiratory disorders. Many more are subjected to air and water pollutants. The effects of environmental changes will affect not just the present generation of children but also those as yet unborn. More than 82 per cent of the world's children live in the developing countries. Rapid population growth in these regions will  of course  increase their number in future. They have to be fed  clothed  housed  educated and allowed to grow up in a healthy environment. It is our duty to protect our planet for them and for future generations. The World Summit for Children  the first-ever meeting of its kind  that is to be convened here in three days' time  will  I hope  set the stage for this task.The Maldives is proud to complete 25 years of membership of the United Nations this year. We remain convinced that in spite of the difficulties it faces from time to time  the United Nations is the only force that is capable of effectively dealing with the innumerable challenges and conflicts that threaten the peaceful development of civilization. We place our sincere trust in this Organization that its efforts will lead to the achievement of mankind's most cherished dream - peace among nations  races and individuals."
"93",4526,"MEX",45,1990,"﻿In addressing these words to the General Assembly upon the inauguration of its forty-fifth session  I bring a message of friendship and cordiality from the Mexican people. The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organisation for the past year tells of the new will and spirit of its Members  as well as the grave risks that still exist. I should like to underscore the praiseworthy efforts of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has successfully used his talent for conciliation in resolving difficulties and in promoting a veritable rebirth of the United Nations. In Javier Peres de Cuellar  Mexico recognizes a conscientious emissary of peace.I should also like to congratulate Ambassador Guido de Marco  who  as President of the General Assembly  will undoubtedly guide the work of this historic session to the successful conclusion our present circumstances require.We welcome the Principality of Liechtenstein as a Member of our Organization. Mexico has always defended the principle of the universality of the United Nations; consequently  we hope that we shall soon be celebrating the entry of those States that still remain outside the system.This is  in a sense  the house of the nations  a house built to foster the secure  civilized coexistence of all peoples. Today the life of the United Nations is attuned to the pulse of the world. I arrive here at a time of great readjustments and unaccustomed hopes. I come with the firm belief that peace and co-operation in the world ere possible because they are indispensable. I come  moreover  with the experience of the changes occurring in my country  which stem from our circumstances and our determination but are closely bound up with the wind· of world change.Today we are experiencing an unexpected shift in history. It is a time of clashes between the past and the present  between what is global and what is local  between power and law. It is a time of imminent risks and also of opportunities that had not been expected in this century. Institutional structures  global balances and our very beliefs have changed. Over and above beliefs  geography and levels of development  there is a new general awareness that economies must be restructured and political practices must be modified in keeping with the new context of interdependence among nations. Today its most positive expression lies in a new attitude and new language used in dealing with what were once believed to be unalterable necessities. These final years of the century are marked not only by man's mastering of nature without harming it but also by the lifting of his spirit. Historic opportunities for building a future which must be common to all but which can also be more civilised and prosperous are opening for our generation.This is not a time for complacency. Today  in the political sphere  we are witnessing the end of the cold war and we celebrate with great hope the active talks between the super-Powers. I recognize the courage and imagination their leaders have shown in escaping from the supposed inevitability that held the world trapped in folly and madness. For the United Nations  the new times have signalled the end of the Security Council's paralysis and the necessary strengthening of effective multilateral action.At the same time  we see with distress that détente  and even co-operation  between Powers which follow different but convergent courses  does not guarantee the end of regional conflicts  nor encourage development in the countries of the South. Enormous amounts of resources formerly devoted to confrontation in Europe have no military purpose today. Will they remain mired in the routine established during the era of cold-war mentality? Will the great Powers be capable of redirecting their concerns and their resources towards the shaping of a world in which international law is the only barrier to the rule of force? Recent events have abruptly reminded us how illusory optimism can be unless we correct major imbalances  unless we have the will to abide by recognised law. Let us hope that the present day  when total war is being abandoned  does not prove also to be a time for the aggravation of inequalities between North and South and for the escalation of local conflicts. The economic sphere is dominated by new trends that are permeating cultures throughout the world. The interdependence of economies has accentuated global financial and trade links. We are witnessing an aggressive battle over quality  price and promptness in the exchange of goods and services. The imperative of competition is redefining the terms of production  social relations  and even family life. Never before has there been such great potential for development. But  as has happened on a number of occasions  there are also the lengthening shadows of unilateral actions  the danger of recession end the devastating impact of outside events on the best efforts and the roost heartfelt desires of the developing nations.The formation of economic blocs is shaping a new multipolar order. Those blocs could give a major impetus to global economic activity if they were to remain open to trade  with high levels of savings for foreign investment and lower world-wide interest rates. That scenario would support the programmes of adjustment and structural change of many countries. Such blocs may  however  look first and foremost to their own interests and raise new protectionist barriers  thereby increasing the imbalances in the international economy. Much depends on reaching a favourable conclusion at the Uruguay Round.Faced with these facts and trends  the world today has realised that a nation cannot promote its independence by erecting walls or by isolating itself  whether for reasons of fear or reasons of nostalgia. Insularity in today's world is a very costly fantasy. To be late in entering global competition means delaying responses to social demands and putting the viability of nations at risk. But to weaken a people's awareness of its identity and throw into disarray its desire to govern its own affairs is even worse. Defending sovereignty in today's world demands deliberate direction of the internal changes that occur in a country if its people are not to suffer involuntarily the effects of world-wide change. Change affects everyone. We share the joy of the German people which will soon live in a unified country. We admire the diligent efforts of the leaders who have demolished the wall of Misunderstanding that divided families and split a single history into two branches  The unification of Germany  the other nations involved in the autumn revolution of 1969 and the new democracies in Latin America represent perhaps the most spectacular changes. But industrialised nations too are hastening to carry out changes that will enable them to retain their competitive edge  reduce deficits  streamline bureaucracies  expend their political rights and freedoms and gain access to new technologies. No country is so strong £hat it can ignore change  nor is any country so weak that it cannot represent an element of risk to the world.We in Mexico recognise this new situation in the world. The prospect of population growth and the new context of international competition are the major challenges that Mexico faces. Our population now numbers 82 million  and over 1.5 million Mexicans are added every year. Historic deficiencies and grinding poverty exists side by side with a modern  diverse and demanding society. It has therefore been essential to ensure sustained and stable economic growth.At the same time  we are adapting our political practices to provide e more sound basis for participation in the world that is currently taking shape. Mexicans will define their own role in the international context.For several years the Mexican economy has been undergoing a process of adjustment aimed at achieving price stability and improving the efficiency of the production apparatus. The consistency of our economic programme has produced very encouraging results. We Mexicans have learnt lessons that we can never forget.We consider it an absolute priority to maintain strict fiscal discipline  as the size of the public deficit defines the margins for action to stabilise the economy and carry out structural reforms. Mexico once had one of the world's most closed economies; now it has one of the most open. The transition to stability seeks rapid trade liberalisation and effective deregulation essential if we are to boost the efficiency of the production apparatus  bring domestic prices into line with those of other countries and stimulate technological change.Mexico took the opportunity to negotiate a reduction in the servicing of its foreign debt  and this has made the country's prospects more secure. We also privatised non-strategic enterprises - doing so in stages - to maximise public revenues end secure the State's ability to meet its prime responsibilities. Mexico promotes foreign investment by permitting access to broader areas of the economy and by providing the essential legal security. Today new forms of association between Government and exporters are making it possible to penetrate and hold markets.In our circumstances this path has led to a stronger economy and to a new  more productive and co-operative spirit in our society. The changes we have made have reached into all areas of our national life. Mexico is undertaking an in-depth reform of the State. Mexicans are changing their institutions and democratic practices. We have a more vigorous and competitive political-party system. Agreement between parties has produced new electoral legislation. We have created a better system to protect human rights and to combat drug trafficking and prevent offenders from escaping punishment. Rights are exercised freely every day. But the most important measure has been to channel a new social energy into the raising of living standards  mainly for those Mexicans who have the least even though they are making the greatest efforts. Mexico seeks to participate actively in all the economic blocs and to establish agreements that will enable us to secure new markets end attract new investment. At this very moment  my country is involved in talks with the United States on the signing of a free-trade agreement that will respond to the liberalisation of our economy  facilitate access of our products to markets abroad  and settle any trade disputes between our countries in an objective manner. The inclusion of Canada in the agreement would result in the formation of the world's largest market. To the south  we are seeking to strengthen economic relations with the rest of Latin America and to lay the foundations for freer trade. Our new links with Europe and with Japan and the other nations of the Pacific should serve to increase our exports and attract investment and technology. This effort also makes us a bridge between the two oceans.Mexico believes that the economic cohesion of blocs should not stem from a desire to protection against real competition. They are born of geography and culture  and their members should interact through increased trade and a greater knowledge of each other. Mexico therefore seeks to renew the cultural world of Latin America. Although shaped by Western tradition  we know that we are different because of the other cultures that have gone into moulding the Latin Americas identity. Our aim is to remove the barriers that impede not only the movement of goods and people but also the spread of the idea of achieving unity while maintaining each country's sovereignty.The Americas astonished the world almost 500 years ago with the greatness of their native civilisations  the wealth of their resources and the creativity of their peoples. Today in Latin America there is a renewed spirit - a democratic and productive spirit  a spirit of justice and solidarity - that one day will again astonish the world. Mexico is committed to that future. There was a time  not long ago  when the language that prevailed at this Assembly was that of the crisis of multilateralism. All the wrongs of the world were recapitulated and  above all  stress was placed on the deficiencies of the mechanisms that existed and the weaknesses of the international community in righting them. This attitude always met with a deaf ear from some  angry reactions from others and impatience from everyone. That was an effect of the cold war.Since the earliest days of when United Nations  and for more than a century before that  Mexico consistently expressed its support for respect for the right of nations to self-determination and non-intervention from abroad  for the legal equality of States and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as principles for civilised coexistence among nations: it has been a crusade in favour of international law. On occasion  our appeals - the only recourse available to a peace-loving nation - went unnoticed by those who adhered to power politics and rejected what they considered the naive politics of law. Today  we feel that the change in the world is proving us right. In the name of international law and its world-wide application  the cold war is disappearing and the community of nations is responding to the challenge of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.The Security Council has condemned the use of force  has taken measures to impose sanctions on the aggressor and to dissuade him  and has indicated ways to make those sanctions effective. Mexico has endorsed the resolutions of the Security Council and has already adopted  within its own sphere  the pertinent decisions for their implementation. We call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi troops currently in Kuwait  the immediate release of the hostages detained by arbitrary force  and full respect for the Vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular immunities for individuals and precincts. If the force of human rights is the most powerful idea of the modern era  invasion is the most consummate form of violating it. International diplomacy is here feeing a new challenge.The world has changed  and Mexico has changed as well; but the value of transformation lies in preserving gains which must not be relinquished. If reason  tolerance  co-operation and a sense of justice are regained through change  then change will have direction and depth. Since its founding  that has been the watchword of the United Nations the abiding rule of law as opposed to the arbitrary will of the powerful; negotiation and reconciliation of interests instead of the use of force; consultation  concerted agreement and co-operation as means of settling differences  of mitigating conflicts and banishing war. The United Nations was an act of legal and political creativity  of culture and civilisation against irrationality and barbarism. Change has shown us that we can be responsible to ourselves  to past generations and to those yet to come in a way the world has never yet known. We should not let this historic opportunity pass us by.This is a representative forum or  to be more precise  it is the premier forum of world public opinion. Today  the General Assembly san also be the conduit of the new era of exchanges based on the principle of sovereign equality and in keeping with the norms of international law. Thus  it is painful to recall how many times in the past adopted resolutions have been ignored  and heartening today to see the norms respected. I come to this General Assembly persuaded that all Member States are committed to strengthening the process of recovery of the United Nations which has now begun. There is a historic mission to carry out  and today we are closer than ever before to accomplishing it.We embark upon the decade of the 1990s beset by international uncertainties  but knowing that we have it in us to resolve them. The fundamental tasks of international law are those concerned with world stability  with the agendas of war and peace  of development and social justice in the world. The far-reaching changes have given a global character to potential responses to these major threats to the desire for productive and peaceful coexistence. The world-wide effort to eliminate the origins of conflicts again finds its firmest resolve in the establishment of law.To a large extent  the danger represented by the regional conflicts that we are experiencing today derives from the arms race. Commitments in the field of arms reduction  particularly the reduction of nuclear and chemical weapons  and agreements for reducing trafficking in armaments  are key issues for peace in the decade of the 1990s.There are encouraging signs. The Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  and the understanding reached on a SO per cent reduction in their strategic long-range nuclear arsenals are very positive factors. These have helped to create a favourable atmosphere for the European negotiations on the reduction of conventional arsenals  and have contributed favourably to an enhanced climate of detente. Respect for others  both within each nation and between States  is the political basis for negotiation and the underlying principle of international law. We call on all nations in our hemisphere and throughout the world to subscribe to treaties such as those of Tlatelolco and Rarotonga. Let us reduce the levels of conventional weapons and military budgets  and may the savings achieved thereby be directed towards development and not towards destruction.The search for peace has led us to recognise concerted regional agreement as one of the most suitable ways of creating favourable conditions for negotiations. Central America  the pain-wracked isthmus of our continent  has been assailed by armed conflict and a draining of its economies for more than a decade. With respect for all concerned  Mexico has worked  first bilaterally  then multilaterally and subsequently through its present efforts within the Group of Eight and under the San Jose Accord  to bring the conflict to an end and to initiate a stage in which there will be development. Achieving peace in the region depends  first of all  on the tenacious efforts of the countries in the zone; the Esquipulas agreements are among the best examples of these. The Central American Governments are on the road to reconciliation and peace. They demand and deserve international support for their efforts. Just as resources were delivered to the warring parties during the time of conflict  they should now be provided to the Governments responsible for the development of the region. That is not occurring  and is alarming because the population dynamics and the age-old deficiencies of the region mean that there can be so lasting peace unless it is based on economic improvement.Regional peace-seeking groups are irreplaceable. Efforts to solve the Cambodian conflict involve the resolute participation of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other countries in the region. Progress in solving the problems of southern Africa have been based largely on the efforts of the front-line countries: the regional agreement is a gaga of the processes leading towards peace. We expect the invaluable co-operation of the Arab League in finding a prompt solution to the problems in the Persian Gulf Another war of global dimensions is being waged against drug trafficking and terrorism  increasingly united in their criminal conspiracy against humanity. Here again  a new concept has been accepted that recognises the true international nature of the problem and eliminates any pretext for not acting. It is a chain of terror that includes production  distribution and consumption as different parts of one and the same threat. Simultaneous measures must be taken to provide production options in places where drug crops are planted  to fight drug traffickers and to educate and rehabilitate those who consume drugs. The 1988 Vienna Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and the preparation of a world plan of action are highly encouraging efforts. We trust that the new structure of United Nations agencies will effectively assist in multilaterally approaching this scourge.In Mexico's case  drug trafficking not only threatens the health of our young people but also undermines national security and the strength of our institutions. In the course of my administration  Mexico has lost more than 100 people in this war  has arrested over 20 000 drug traffickers and has prevented 7 billion doses of marijuana and 3 billion doses of cocaine and heroin from reaching the youth of the world by confiscating drugs with a street value of $120 billion. Such is the depth of Mexico's commitment to the war on drug trafficking. It must not be forgotten  however  that the rule of law prevails in its fight at all times. We cannot allow rights to be violated when we wage this war  much less permit the sovereignty of States to be violated for such a purpose. Unswerving determination and full and respectful collaboration are the civilized solution  as they are in all questions of war and peace.Lack of development and of social progress holds the same potential for disrupting global stability as have conflict and war. The highest hopes for this new age of multipolarity  an age characterized by respect and co-operation  will mean little if the promotion of growth and productive employment to reduce poverty is nullified by protectionist barriers  negative terms of trade and the net transfer of the South's resources to the industrialized world. The grievous and widening gap between rich and poor countries is a source of concern to all. World-wide environmental deterioration and pollution jeopardise social development and undermine the productive endeavours of our nations. This problem  whose origin and consequences extend across national frontiers  demands a multilateral solution.Development and environmental protection are compatible if all of us accept our responsibility for the environment and if the necessary resources and technologies are channelled to the developing countries to enable them to offer their inhabitants options that do not despoil the environment. Horns of coexistence that did not include the developing nations in the building of prosperity would ignore the international community's reason for existence and waste the benefits of peace. The 1992 world Conference on Environment and Development should be a turning-point in the firm commitment of the community of nations to alleviate the harmful effects o£ environmental deterioration.Mexico is doing its part and is seeking to balance its industrialisation with a healthy environment. We are protecting whales  dolphins and a dozen of the world's remaining 14 species of sea turtles that lay their eggs on our beaches. We are providing more protection for our tropical forests and are actively participating in the world strategy for preventing changes in the global climate. We seek more co-operation  especially financial and technological co-operation  in attacking the problems of pollution in Mexico City. This is a struggle in behalf of civilisation  the civilisation that will come after us  which we cannot abandon without rejecting our own nature.In the midst of the immense chaos that the French Revolution caused in Europe two centuries ago  in a world suddenly left without points of reference and threatened by new forms of despotism  a philosopher of that age and of all ages enthusiastically but cautiously distinguished between universal law  the promise of everlasting peace among nations and respect for the freedom of all. Today  when the end of the cold war is changing the world's geopolitics  when the people of Eastern Europe are once again finding the magnificence and the risks of freedom and when  at the same time  the danger of a war with unprecedented consequences is emerging and new problems are gaining priority  we must return to the principles of that centuries-old perception.What should the future of our Organisation be? The circumstances that favour the strengthening of the United Nations demand responsibility. The momentum of these times bears with it the risk of tempting us to act in haste  to create functions for the United Nations that go beyond the provisions of its Charter  functions that not all of its Member States are willing to undertake. Let us  therefore  reflect on our present condition  so that we can envisage a future that  while not free from problems  will have common rules for resolving them.What cannot be put off is the implementation of the fundamental principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations  which are Mexico's principles as well. The interdependence of the modern world and the conviction that there are global problems whose solution can be attained only through international action have led some to cast doubt on the validity of those principles. That is an erroneous view; the most progressive forms of international organisation that have emerged in recent times have had as their point of departure the twin rights of territorial integrity and political sovereignty. That is where the ultimate legitimacy of the Organisation resides  and that is what offers the possibility of achieving agreements aimed at constructive and effective international action. States are the arena of self-determination  and only through respect for them is international determination possible. The challenge of our times is to recognize that the trend towards globalization demands the effective application of international law to establish the rules governing co-operative efforts in the face of problems that  by their very nature  are international. But this should never mean a weakening of the sovereignty of States on the pretext of a supposed world community of individuals. Let us not repeat the mistake of establishing a universal rationale aimed at wiping away the history of peoples.It is possible for us to view the world as an entity only because we hold a point of view  our own  that of each nation. That is why our attachment to values  to history  to culture  which is the cement of societies  persists and indeed is growing stronger. Sovereignty and democracy are essential in a world of interdependence. Only thus will self-government serve to make commitments  forge links and be open to the community of nations. Only a real detente can lead to genuine changes.The lawful defence and promotion of the sovereign interrelationship of nations does not conflict with the certainty of national identity but rather requires it. The scale of the world's great problems can no longer be used as a pretext for practising new forms of interventionist and hegemonism. To each citizen  each family and each society  forming part of a political community is something of decisive value. Only those that are sovereign agents respected by the international community can be participants in international affairs. In the words of Mexican internationalist Genaro Estradas ""No country should ask for something which the sovereignty of its own people gives it the right to receive."" Uncertainty can cause fear  but it can also give rise to unexplored opportunities. More than ever before  the current situation offers unique conditions for constructive encounters between nations. In order to take advantage of this  we must cast aside our fear of the unknown. The effective protection of nations requires giving free rein to their capabilities  not limiting them. It means interacting and reaching agreement  not responding unilaterally. It means having confidence in ourselves so that we may take an active part in shaping world history  which is one and the same and belongs to all. Are we prepared to give politics and diplomacy a chance to work  despite their limitations  their slow results  their unavoidable but indispensable commitments?In this regard the universal democratic idea is the great legacy of these last years of the century. Fragile though it is  it is being built throughout the world in the face of waning but still dangerous resistance. The democratic idea reflects the complexity of present-day societies agreement between different men and women who wish to live as a productive community under democracy; respect for their dignity and for their basic rights; the sum of talents that are free and capable of facing global challenges. In a sense a new utopia  richer than any that preceded it  is emerging  born of a true confrontation between doctrinaire principles and historical facts. If the twentieth century wore to leave us only this legacy  it would be making its full contribution to mankind. For all nations  however  there is still a long way to go  and the ideal is still far from becoming α reality.World justice must become the heritage for the twenty-first century. Our passion for democracy must take into account the need to bring into being the conditions that make it possible to exercise political and civil rights  enabling them to flourish and make men brothers in spirit. Beyond any doubt  the initial effort must be internal  national and continuous. But it also calls for the participation of the international community  through its institutions  in support of the hardships suffered by entire peoples in their efforts to achieve more prosperous lives.International law will thus become all the more relevant  because the interrelationship of interests and the globalization of political values will necessarily lead to the joint solutions of common problems. The unquestionable link between development and peace makes it necessary to pursue dialogue and to act in accordance with the law.Mexico has maintained and will always maintain a firm commitment to a policy of principles. We believe in law as the foundation of a culture of respect among nations. We believe in democracy as a measure of peoples' own will. We seek a more deeply rooted justice  both within our country and among nations. It cannot be otherwise  because it is our conviction  rooted in our history and our geography  that the international principles of Mexico and the United Nations do indeed constitute a framework for action that better promotes our interests. Law ultimately constitutes an objective barrier - although unfortunately not an insurmountable one - to the arbitrary exercise of power.The United Nations is the most nearly perfect form of political organization for the sovereign interrelationships of States. As the interdependence among States increases  so too will the need to move forward to more effective levels of organization. May the task of the United Nations for the twenty-first century be to establish democratic justice in the world.The most important events in history have always been the result of achieving something previously regarded as impossible. It would be futile to attempt to place limits on the progress of free men  but it would be even more futile to try to place constraints on the effects of the commitment to act with goodwill. Today in the United Nations we have a world Organization that gives full priority to respect for international law and the principles of its founding Charter  an Organization that guarantees the search for solutions to the global problems of our time and that upholds the indissoluble link between peace and development. In short  we have an Organization that promotes respect as one of the founding principles of democracy and of open  equitable co-operation to make international justice a reality. This is the only way to find hope for the world."
"94",4621,"MLI",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation  I should like to congratulate you whole-heartedly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your personal qualifications as a seasoned diplomat bode well indeed for our work  and my delegation assures you that we stand ready to co-operate to the fullest.Allow me likewise to convey our deep appreciation  through you  to your distinguished predecessor. General Joseph Garba  and to express our pride in the remarkable way he guided the work of the forty-fourth session.My delegation pays very special tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for helping to strengthen our Organisation and enhance its prestige and for his constant efforts to safeguard international peace and security. The international community has grown by the admission to the Organisation of two new Members  namely  Namibia and Liechtenstein. My delegation welcomes those two countries  which will help to bring us closer still to the universalist ideal of the United Nations.The reunification of Yemen and that of Germany unquestionably reflect the emergence of a new era in international relations and an encouraging development in contemporary thinking. To both those countries  I should like hers and now to express the most sincere and warm friendship of the Malian people. Their two examples should spur the international community to encourage divided peoples and nations to regain their unity.The whole world has had objective reason to welcome the profound changes that occurred in international political relations during the first six months of this year. The process of détente  under way for several years  has gone forward. That new climate has made it possible to approach disarmament matters from a fresh perspective and to seek negotiated solutions to certain regional conflicts.In Africa  the accession of Namibia to independence on 21 March 1990 was the culmination of long years of sacrifice made by the valiant people of their country.It is fitting  in this connection  to rejoice at the eminently constructive role played by the United Nations in the effective conduct of the process of decolonizing Namibia.In South Africa  the freeing of Nelson Mandela  the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  of the Communist Party and of numerous other anti-apartheid movements  the dialogue initiated between the ANC and the Government of Frederick de Klerk  the partial lifting of the state of emergency and the freeing of political prisoners are unquestionably very positive developments. While encouraging the ongoing process  we none the less call upon the international community to remain vigilant  so as to induce the Pretoria Government to abolish apartheid totally and thus to speed the advent of a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa. We must not consider lifting the sanctions until the goals embodied in the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa  adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session  have been attained.With regard to Western Sahara  my delegation has taken note of the Secretary-General's report summarising the implementation of the peace plan devised jointly by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations  which provides  in particular  for the holding of a general  free and orderly referendum on self-determination.As to the territorial dispute between Chad and Libya  my delegation welcomes the decision of the two parties to bring the matter before the International Court of Justice and expresses the hope that they will thus arrive at a definitive settlement. For several months now the Hest African subregion Liberia has been the scene of bloody turmoil in a fratricidal conflict. This civil war has already taken a toll in thousands of lives  including those of nationals from my country. It has done enormous damage to the economic infrastructure and triggered a massive exodus into neighbouring countries.Mali  always in favour of dialogue and working things out in concert  backed the decisions taken by the Economic Community of West African States (BCOHAS) to settle this tragic problem. He strongly appeal to all the parties to the conflict to show tolerance and a sense of patriotism in striving together to put an end 'co their dissension and to come to grips with the real problems of the country - national reconstruction and development.Elsewhere  the people and Government of Mali are delighted at the favourable trend towards a truly peaceful resolution of the crisis that had developed between two fraternal neighbours and partners  namely  Senegal and Mauritania. My delegation is fully aware of what this means and  keen to preserve harmony  cohesion and co-operation in our subregion  reaffirms the readiness of Mali to help further the felicitous outcome to this dispute.Beyond the African continent the high-level meeting of delegations from North Korea and from South Korea in September bears witness to their manifest determination to achieve the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation. My delegation encourages them to pursue their consultations so as to attain that end  which is in keeping with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and with the evolution of the world political climate.My delegation notes with satisfaction that the efforts set in train to resolve the Cambodian problem have brought the five permanent members of the Security Council to work out the framework for a peaceful settlement of that conflict. We welcome the acceptance by the various parties directly concerned of the settlement plan and the  establishment of a Supreme National Council. We exhort them to go on negotiating so as to be able to put an end to almost two decades of tragedy.Turning now to the question of Afghanistan  my delegation encourages the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue to bring his good offices to bear with a view to arriving at a negotiated settlement within the context of the Geneva agreements entered into on 14 August 1988.The problem of Cyprus is still of concern to Mali. My delegation urges the parties to pursue dialogue so that the modalities of settlement already agreed upon in the 1977 and 1979 agreements  as well as in Security Council resolution 649 (1990)  might indeed be implemented. For our part we believe that the sovereignty  unity and non-aligned status of that country must be safeguarded.The relative calm that had characterised international relations was suddenly upset at the beginning of the month of August by Iraq's aggression against Kuwait. My country  which has always rejected resorting to force in international relations  condemned the invasion of Kuwait and demanded the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from that country. Mali has endorsed all the decisions taken by the Security Council and welcomes the climate of co-operation that has prevailed within the Council during the consideration of this painful issue.The Gulf crisis has made it possible to highlight the dedication of the international community to respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. For the first time the members of the Council have agreed in condemning aggression  invasion and annexation. This unanimity is a positive reflection of the new climate of confidence now prevailing in international relations. A new page has thus been turned in the history of the United Nations. We sincerely hope to see the effects of this new wind of change continue in the Security Council. Thus  in the name of the principle of non-aggression and respect for the territorial integrity of States  the Security Council will with the same vigour and determination be able to take the appropriate measures to put an end to Israel's occupation of South Lebanon  the Syrian Golan Heights  the Hest Bank  the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.It is high time for all the States Members of our Organization to abide by the pertinent resolutions of the Organization so that the International Peace Conference on the Middle East can be held. That Conference  which the international community is so urgently calling for  will enable the peoples of the region at last to know peace. The Palestinian question  which is at the core of the problem of the Middle East  can be settled in a just and lasting way only by the free exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence.My delegation is aware of the full significance of the progress made in disarmament. In fact  the agreements on chemical weapons entered into at Washington last June came on the heels of previous treaties on the elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles. We hail the agreement in principle won in Vienna on conventional arms and encourage the two super-Powers to pursue their negotiations with a view eventually to entering into a full-fledged agreement on the subject. The considerable resources that could be made available as a result of general and complete disarmament should promote the restoration of growth and development in the developing countries.The Gulf crisis will have extremely adverse economic and financial consequences for the developing countries that do not produce oil  countries already badly stricken by previous shocks and crises. This will unquestionably mean a further constriction of financial markets and  above all  a considerable cut-back in terms of aid for development. The consequences of those events  compounded by the upheaval that took place in the countries of Eastern Europe  which are now plunged into sweeping structural transformations as they seek better to integrate themselves into the global economy  might lead to exacerbating the marginalisation of developing countries in general but especially those in Africa. In most developing countries the debt burden is a major obstacle in the way of development  and there must be a comprehensive approach to the debt crisis.The various measures taken to lighten external indebtedness  though significant  should be expanded and revised in such a way as to take into account the need for growth and development in the debtor countries. If there is to be a real way out of the external debt problem of developing countries  the international community will have to strengthen solidarity within its ranks in the context of shared responsibility. Urgent measures must be taken to reverse the massive negative transfer of resources from developing to developed countries  for these transfers have contributed to reducing in real terms the volume of official development assistance  thereby creating a serious shortfall in resources earmarked for development programmes.The drop in commodity prices is yet another source of concern for developing countries. It brings in its wake unpredictability and a steady decline in their export revenues. It reduces the capacity for internal financing of development and exacerbates the difficulties related to debt servicing. It thus becomes a matter of urgency to apply the appropriate solutions to deal with these problems in keeping with the pertinent provisions of the Integrated Programme for Commodities.The improved international climate  notwithstanding the Gulf crisis  should prompt the community of States to think further about the establishment of an economic order that would be both equitable and transparent and more compatible with the profound reforms undertaken by the developing countries. The international community should spare no effort to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round of negotiations. These negotiations must overcome the inertia obstructing the transfer of technology and know-how and create the appropriate framework within which to promote the export of manufactured products from the developing countries to the developed nations.The Preparatory Committee of the Whole  which was entrusted with the preparation of an international strategy for the United Nations fourth development decade  has submitted its report to the General Assembly. The strengthening of multilateralism should enable the international community to give effective expression to the full meaning of the pertinent proposals embodied in that document. The Declaration adopted at the eighteenth special session  on international economic co-operation  in particular the revitalisation of economic growth and development in the developing countries  was a signal event in the annals of our Organization.It is therefore important that the pertinent provisions of the Declaration  which was adopted by consensus by all States Members of the United Nations  not remain a dead letter. This constructive consensus must lead to a global charter of solidarity  thereby reducing the disparities between the developed and developing countries.The second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which was just concluded  commands the attention of the international community as a whole. The United Nations system and all the partners to the development of the least developed countries must make a substantial contribution to the attainment of the five priorities spelled out in the Programme of Action aimed at stopping the spread of poverty and creating a powerful surge of renewed growth and development in the least developed countries.By the same token  in their implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Children  just solemnly adopted by the Heads of State or Government  the attention of all States and international and non-governmental organisations must be focused particularly on the proposals regarding the survival  protection and development of children. The future of the world indeed depends on what the present generation is willing to invest in the physical  intellectual and moral health of the generations to come  and the unprecedented success of the World Summit for Children truly augurs well for the future. Notwithstanding the special programme adopted by the United Nations in 1986  economic and social conditions on the African continent have steadily deteriorated year after year. In point of fact  the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  has been seriously hampered by an adverse international economic environment. The plummeting prices of Africa's export products  the exacerbation of the external debt crisis  the lessening of capital flows in terms of official development aid  and the inverse transfer of financial resources from Africa to the developed countries have deprived Africans of the wherewithal needed to implement their development programmes.Moreover  despite the positive results recorded in terms of structural adjustment programmes  the application of these policies and programmes has contributed in many countries to increased unemployment  decreasing expenditures in such essential sectors as health and education and the marginalisation of a large sector of the population  thereby heightening social tension.Far from being reversed and overcome  the marginalisation of the African continent is becoming entrenched  given the new configurations in the international economic structures and the emergence of huge economic entities in Europe and North America.Hence  Africa's stark economic situation calls for a specific response from the international community and for efforts by the African countries themselves with a view to speeding up their economic integration in line with the 1980 Lagos Plan of Action.The systems of production and consumption that have so far prevailed in the world  especially in the industrialised countries  have brought our planet to the verge of an ecological catastrophe. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in 1992  will give the international community an exceptional opportunity to resolve the serious environmental problems. Mali  a country hard hit by the adverse impact of drought and desertification  attaches great importance to the success of the Conference. Mindful of this circumstance  my country will be hosting in December the African Conference on environment and sustainable development.In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm that our Organisation is duty-bound to strive tirelessly to strengthen international peace and security  to work towards the revitalisation of growth and development in the developing countries  to eradicate hunger and poverty in the world and to preserve the environment  the common heritage of mankind. Our generation has already become aware of all the harmful and diverse pressures man has exerted on nature and of the need for a new social interaction the world over.If peace  harmony and a ¡readiness for greater mutual understanding and co-operation among all nations throughout the world are indeed permanent priorities  there can be no doubt that we can in fact give tangible expression to that noble ideal of the United Nations: the well-being of all mankind.

"95",4662,"MLT",45,1990,"﻿It is indeed an honour for me personally and on behalf of the Maltese delegation to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. For Malta and its people it is a matter of great pride and satisfaction to see one of its eminent personalities occupy the highest seat of our Organization and preside over its deliberations at this critical juncture when we are witnessing the evolution of a new world order.I wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to your distinguished predecessor  Major-General Joseph M. Garba  for the excellent manner in which he guided the work of the forty-fourth session of this Assembly.Malta also wishes to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his unstinting efforts in guiding this world body through the many difficult tasks assigned to him by our Organization. We owe him our deep appreciation and assure him of Malta's full-co-operation and support in his endeavours. My government extends warm congratulations to the Principality of Liechtenstein  a small and friendly European country like Malta  on its admission as a sovereign and equal member of the United Nations.We are on the eve of witnessing another momentous event in world history. Tomorrow  the process of change in Europe will further be accomplished by the German unification. Malta joins other delegations in congratulating the people and Government of Germany on this historic occasion.When we look at the political changes taking place not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world  we are encouraged that the future of our children eon be built on strong foundations of security and co-operation. In this respect the United Nations role is paramount in reshaping the destinies of our countries peoples.The end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s have recorded an upheaval in international politics ushering in a search for accommodation  conciliation and co-operation  a relaxation of global tensions and genuine efforts for the resolution of global and regional questions. The global community is moving forward towards a situation which truly upholds the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Malta is more than proud to be a party to this collective effort. The reaction to the current crisis in the Gulf is proof of the determination and ability of this Organization to face up to new challenges and to forge ahead in maintaining peace and security.Last year  the Prime Minister of Malta began his address to the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly by remarking that perhaps for the first time it could reasonably be done with a heart-felt smile of contentment at the progress achieved over the past year  rather than with clenched teeth in response to mounting international tensions. This year  however  while it would be unwarrantedly too pessimistic to say all spiritual good humour had been wiped out and twisted into a grimace of dismay  any smile we can manage to muster can only be at best ambivalent and suffused with an overlay of anguish.The present moment is one of paradox. We must still rejoice that perhaps the most painful through which for many years had lain in the flesh of this Assembly and in many ways had handicapped its functioning with full effectiveness as a means of global growth  is in the final stages of being removed. The unified approach of the Security Council on the Gulf crisis has given an unprecedented dimension to world security and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The overwhelming condemnation of the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq reflects the political willingness of nations small and large  poor and rich  to stand firm and united in the face of threats to international peace and security.But this moment of fulfilment is also a moment of anguish. The threat of a terrible war hangs ominously in front of us. The Government of Malta is fully aware of the sufferings and deprivations which the situation in the Gulf is bringing on those concerned. The economic sanctions on Iraq impose sacrifices also upon those that apply them. Yet the suppression of acts of aggression by collective action is an indication of the seriousness with which we all - as Members of the United Nations - should react in order to stop such acts of aggression from being perpetrated by one country against another. We have to ensure that in this world the might of right will prevail over the right of might.Unfortunately  the mental an£ material energies which we would have liked to see increasingly focused and concentrated on how best to ensure the positive restructuring of eroded antagonistic edifices and on the creative projection of new collaborative networks for global co-operation have once again had to be largely directed to crisis intervention. There is  however  a hopeful remark that should perhaps be made in this connection. Contemporary science has taught us that pressures applied to m weak system will distort and nay destroy it  but that the same pressures applied to a stronger system may  instead of disrupting it  stimulate it to reorganise itself better. Indeed  in these last few months we have seen a consolidation of important concepts that are shaking off mistrust  confrontation and disagreements. Confidence  co-operation and understanding have given impetus to negotiations on arms limitation and disarmament measures. The Negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)  as well as the negotiations in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) concerning confidence- and security-building measures in Europe  are contributing to a new world order in which not only participating States but the community of nations at large will benefit. Malta is taking an active part in the CSCE negotiations and making its modest contribution to the commitments of the Helsinki Final Act.The trail-biasing agreement reached earlier this year between the United States and the Soviet Union on the destruction and non-production of chemical weapons has added momentum to the multilateral negotiations being undertaken in the Conference on Disarmament on a convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction. Malt  urges all those countries involved in the negotiations to recognise the urgency of this objective and to accelerate the tempo of the negotiations.As reflected in the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  the United Nations has shown vitality and consistency on other questions as well. Namibia's smooth transition to independence under the watchful guidance of the United Nations is one of the foremost achievements of the international community. Malta is ready to assist the Namibian people in their nation building  as it did before Namibia attained independence.In southern Africa the United nations has been instrumental in condemning apartheid and in exerting pressure resulting in the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela  a symbol of courage and hope for the people of South Africa.The successful conclusion this year  of the elections held in Nicaragua under the supervision of a United Nations Observer Mission  as well as the role played by the United Nations Observer Group in Central America  have set in motion a new peace-keeping and peace-making role for the United Nations.The progress made with regard to the settlement of the Cambodian problem is also a credit to our Organisation Through the efforts of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council a framework has been defined for a comprehensive political settlement of that problem. Malta supports the efforts towards that end.The positive tread of the United Nations involvement in reconciliation and peaceful solutions to problems can be measured by the various ongoing initiatives being undertaken  including the new round of talks on Western Sahara  the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1990) and the growing commitment to an early political solution of the Afghan question.We are pleased to note the constructive dialogue evolving between the two Koreas on the process of reunification in the Korean peninsula  which must be the ultimate objective. In the interim period Malta would support the Republic of Korea in seeking United Nations membership  as it would also support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should it wish to do likewise.The progress on those issues has made our system stronger and should therefore stimulate our Organisation to resolve the outstanding issues that still require a long-lasting solution. I am referring specifically to three questions that directly and indirectly affect the Mediterranean and Middle East regions  namely  the questions of Palestine  Cyprus and Lebanon.The Assembly will agree that the time is more than ripe to find a solution to the question of Palestine  which has been on the agenda of the Organisation for the past 45 years. The international community should feel very concerned that no significant progress has been made on this question  which has been recognised as the core of the Middle East conflict  with all its manifold and complex ramifications. The convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East has been called for with overwhelming support by the General Assembly at previous sessions. That call should not remain unheeded. In Malta's view it remains the best vehicle for enabling Palestinians and Israelis to coexist in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders.We are perturbed to note that no progress has been made on the Cyprus question within the framework of the inter-communal talks. At the same time we note the resolve of the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus and the fact that they remain committed to the objective of finding a solution to that question.The turbulent situation in Lebanon is yet another issue that constitutes a preoccupation for the international community and that all of us have a responsibility to resolve.The community of nations represented in the Assembly has shown a new strength in its determination to resist the pressures that attempt to push it in the direction of international anarchy and chaotic violence. But beyond that  there should not be a mere restoration of the status quo ante. Time is irreversible  and there is no mere going-back in history. If nothing else  the present crisis will have driven home the importance of the very topics that some Member States  including Malta  have been pressing upon the attention of the Assembly  even though they may have seemed to be too future-oriented  especially given the harassing nature of existing circumstances.The present crisis has shown in the clearest way that the gravest threat to peace and security is no longer rooted in East-West tensions but in the complex of socio-economic and environmental issues on which the future conditions of life on the planet depend the sources of energy  the mechanisms for its commercialisation  global systems of communication  demography and so on.In his statement last year the Prime Minister chose to concentrate on two related points of general interest. The first was the common management of extraterritorial spaces  the resources of which could be of significant and even crucial importance both to the future of mankind end to the Organisation's role in fashioning it. The second was the development of new systems of governance that would take into account the great changes that have occurred in the world in the 45 years that have elapsed since the United Nations system was first set up in the wake of the Second World War.Notable among those changes was the decline in the effective competence of nation-States  the basic units of the United Nations system  linked to the rise in influence of a varied cast of non-governmental and private sectors on the international scene. Recognition of such changes and their reflection in systems of governance were particularly relevant to the setting up of appropriate international structures for the management of shared resources for the common good of mankind. However  and more generally  that is also highly advisable in relation to the whole complex of socio-economic and environmental issues that forms the context in which the most acute of the world's present troubles have arisen and are arising. Today it is perhaps easier to see that  while the Assembly cannot elude the task of reacting to the immediate problems of international peace  especially the maintenance of the security of Member States  it would be equally wrong to lose sight or track of prospects likely to bear fruit in a slightly broader perspective. Ad hoc reactions to crises have to be fitted into a more pro-active approach to global security  a concept that has now to be used in a sense broad enough to include environmental and economic survival. For that reason  the topics raised by the Prime Minister in his statement last year have  if anything  become even more relevant.The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in 1992  in which so many high expectations have been placed  offers an opportunity for the international community to address the global ecological challenges that confront mankind.Any effective  collective action in the major areas that the Conference is expected to tackle - whether climate change or biodiversity and genetic heritage - entails envisaging new methods of funding  such as the introduction of some form of international taxation. In this light  the common management of shared resources  including those in extra-territorial spaces  and the destination of relevant benefits take on particular interest. So also do the proposals to ensure effective forums for continuing dialogue on a realistic basis and for circumventing the breakdowns which have occurred in so many key sectors vital to the development of a new world order - political  social  economic and environmental.Let me conclude by quoting from the statement made by Nr. Spaak of Belgium  the President of the first session of the General Assembly  in 1946. His wise advice as to the functions of a good representative to the Assembly are most relevant  particularly at this time when we are pinning all our hopes on the collective system embodied in the Charter of the United Nations""Each of us must first of all make an effort to sink our preferences  to put aside our particular sympathies and our particular antipathies. Naturally  we must all watch over the interests of our respective countries  but we shall not succeed unless we are convinced that those interests must take their place in the wider setting of the general interest  and unless we are conscious  over and above the interests of our own country  of the interests of the world and of mankind."" "
"96",4708,"MMR",45,1990,"﻿Sir  allow me to begin by offering you the warmest felicitations of the delegation of the Union of Myanmar on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-fifth session. Your unanimous election to this high office is an expression of the confidence of the entire membership in the outstanding qualities of leadership you have amply demonstrated during your long and distinguished career. It is also a tribute to the active and constructive role played by Malta in international relations.I wish also to express the deep appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Garba of Nigeria for his invaluable contribution to the success of the forty-fourth session and of the three special sessions of the Assembly held during his tenure.May I also take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his total commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter and for his tireless efforts to promote international peace and justice as well as understanding and co-operation among nations. The world is indeed fortunate to have him at the helm of the Organization at this crucial juncture in the history of mankind.My delegation takes great pleasure in warmly welcoming to our midst the Principality of Liechtenstein. We have already had occasion to extend a similar welcome to Namibia earlier in the year. As the delegations of Namibia and Liechtenstein take their rightful places in this Assembly  the United Nations has come a step nearer to its ultimate goal of universality of membership.Myanmar has consistently held the view that no State that in able and willing to fulfil the obligations of membership of the United Nations should be denied admission to our Organization  Therefore we support the expressed desire of the Republic of Korea to join our ranks - this without prejudice to the goal of eventual Korean reunification. In this regard  we welcome the initiation of high-level intra-Korean dialogue and earnestly hope that it will lead to an early agreement on the reunification of the long-divided Korean nation.On 3 October last the German nation became one again. As an ardent supporter of the cause of peaceful reunification of divided nations  Myanmar warmly welcomes that momentous event. We are confident that the united Germany  with its renewed spirit and vast resources  will increasingly become a major force for peace  stability and prosperity not only in Europe but in the world at large.In the same spirit we are pleased to welcome the peaceful merger of the two Yemeni States.The forty-fifth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time of historic and profound changes worldwide. The past 12 months have witnessed an acceleration of the qualitative change in the relationship between the two super-Powers and between the two major military alliances. Ideological barriers which had once generated a deep-seated adversary psychosis and which had long bedevilled relations among States have virtually disappeared. These have given way to new attitudes and perceptions  resulting in a new pattern of relationship that has moved beyond the stage of a mere relaxation of tension to a stage of active co-operation and partnership.All these transformations have brought the world to the threshold of a new era. However since the end of the Second World War has there been a more favourable political climate or a better opportunity for the nations of the world to fashion a new international order based on the timeless principles enshrined in the Charter.The immediate impact of this changing situation is the emergence of a collegial spirit among the permanent members of the Security Council  which has greatly enhanced its effective functioning. We welcome this development  which we believe could act as a deterrent to individual States or group of States from resorting to actions inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter. It could also inhibit hegemonic ambitions  at either the global or the regional level. However  the world must pay heed to the caution sounded by our Secretary-General in his latest report on the work of the Organization: ""agreement among the major Powers must carry with it the support of a majority of Member States if it is to make the desired impact on the world situation. It is the willing endorsement of the decisions of the Security Council by the international community that can best counter any impression  likely to create anxiety  of world affairs being run by a directorate."" ΓΑ 45 1. p. 13V The steadily increasing trust and confidence in inter-State relations generated by the dramatic improvement of relations between the two militarily most significant Powers have opened a window of opportunity for the international community to come to grips with the various outstanding questions in the field of arms control and disarmament.. Military doctrines born of the cold war and based on adversarial strategies  which had fuelled the spiralling arms race of the past decades  have become largely irrelevant. While notable achievements  such as the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  have been made  the pace of negotiations on reduction of strategic arsenals  banning of chemical weapons and cessation of all nuclear-weapon tests  to mention only a few  has been agonisingly slow. We earnestly hope that endeavours will be made to speed up the pace of disarmament negotiations and to set higher  more ambitious targets within shorter time frames  for the reduction and ultimate elimination of nuclear and other mass-destruction weapons. Moreover  massive conventional forces should be pared down to the levels needed for purposes of legitimate national self-defence. As we stand at the threshold of a new era we see looming ahead both exceptional promises and daunting challenges.	In April of this year  the entire world rejoiced at the peaceful transition of Namibia to independence The Namibian experience has renewed hopes for a peaceful change in South Africa leading to a total dismantling of the universally condemned system of apartheid. These hopes have been reinforced by positive factors conducive to such a change that have emerged in the country during the past months. Foremost among them is the exemplary far-sightedness  wisdom and statesmanship that has marked Mr. Nelson Mandela's every action and pronouncements ever since his release from prison. Due credit must also be given to the political courage displayed by President De Klerk in pledging to abandon apartheid and to seek a peaceful transition to a new South Africa  non-racial and democratic. Thanks to the pragmatism and realism displayed by them  the African National Congress of South Africa (AMC) and the South Africa  Government have been able to adopt a joint declaration aimed at accelerating the political process towards a negotiated settlement. Promising though the situation is  it is yet too early to assume with complete assurance that the process for positive change in that country has become irreversible and that an end to the apartheid system is within reach  Apartheid laws and apartheid structures are still in place  the urge the South African Government to do away with these pillars of the outdated system as soon as possible in response to the will of the international community expressed in the Declaration adopted at the sixteenth special session o£ the General Assembly. In the meantime  the international community must not relax its existing pressure in order to convince the yet unrepentant sections of the white minority that apartheid has no future in their country.The resolution of the conflict in Nicaragua  in which the United Nations played a major role  encourages us to hope that the search for peaceful settlement of the conflicts in soma other Central American States  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  will soon bear fruit.Myanmar is a South-East Asian country having close historical ties and cultural affinities with other countries in our sub-region. We are therefore most happy to see significant progress made in the past few weeks towards ending strife in neighbouring Cambodia. We welcome Security Council resolution 668 (1990) of 20 September 1990  endorsing the framework for the comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in that country  formulated by its permanent members. We welcome in particular the acceptance by all the Cambodian parties of this framework in its entirety as the basis for settling the conflict  and the agreement reached by them at the recant Jakarta meeting to form a Supreme National Council. Having regard to the complexities of the conflict  particularly in its international aspects  we agree that the United Nations must play a significant role in the Cambodian peace process. In this connection  we feel that it is only fair that the States members of the United Nations which are not directly involved in this process should be fully apprised in advance of the resource implications of the contemplated United Nations operations in Cambodia  in particular those of a financial nature.With the depth and clarity of perception that has become the hallmark of his assessments of the state of the world the Secretary-General in his latest annual report  has alluded tot ""the dawn of a new era in Europe  streaks of light in some regions and the darkness of old animosities and new hatreds enveloping others. (A 4S 1. p. 3Ì The region where ""old animosities and new hatred·"" are casting their long shadows of darkness and are threatening to undermine the promise of a more peaceful  just and secure international order is the Middle last.Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent purported annexation of Kuwait are acts of aggression by any definition. The prohibition enunciated in the Charter principle that all States ""shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or us· of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State"" is absolute. Whenever and wherever this fundamental principle is violated  it is incumbent upon all peace-loving and law-abiding States to stand resolutely and collectively in defence of this vital fundamental principle in conformity with the provisions of the· Charter. The decisions on the situation taken by the Security Council to date  whose objective is to restore the status quo ante in Kuwait  constitute decisive action to uphold the sanctity of this principle. That is why the Union of Myanmar unreservedly supports the decisions and took immediate action to ensure that all Myanmar Government agencies  private entities and individuals strictly comply with the terms of Security Council resolution 661 (1990). The essential purpose of these decisions is  in our view  to terminate the act of aggression and its consequences through political and diplomatic means. Given the fact that the Gulf region has now been transformed into the scene of the world's heaviest concentration of Multinational adversarial military forces deployed in battle-ready formations  and given the latent volatility of the Middle East as a whole  any other course of action to bring about the objectives set forth in the Security Council resolutions would be fraught with incalculable and far-reaching dangers.The crisis in the Gulf has underscored the urgency to redouble efforts to find a just and durable solution to the Middle East problem as a whole. At the core of this problem is the question of Palestine. We firmly believe that а comprehensive  just and hone· lasting solution to this problem must b· based on the principle of respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area  including Israel  coupled with the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to national independence and sovereignty. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) continue to remain the only workable basis for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in consonance with the above-mentioned principles. To that end  my delegation wholeheartedly supports the proposal to hold an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties concerned on an equal footing. The year 1990 is a remarkable year for international efforts to combat the scourge of illicit drugs. The seventeenth special session of the General Assembly  on narcotic drugs  held in Raw York in February this year  and the World Ministerial Summit to Seduce Demand for Drugs and to Combat the Cocaine Threat  held in London last April  marked two important milestone in the history of mankind's war on illicit drugs. The Global Plan of Action adopted by the seventeenth special session and the Declaration issued at the London Ministerial Summit have given added impetus and sense of purpose to the international campaign against narcotic drugs.We in Myanmar continue to intensify our relentless war on illicit drugs  carrying forward the momentum generated by our nation-wide anti-drug campaigns and programmes which have been in full swing since independence. The multi-faceted and multi-sectoral anti-drug measures being undertaken by the Myanmar authorities nation-wide are making steady headway on all fronts. In February this year and again in April  heroin and other narcotic drugs worth $921 million at prevailing street prices in the United States were destroyed in Yangon in full view of members of the diplomatic corps  representatives of United Rations agencies and foreign journalists.Our multi-faceted and multi-sectoral anti-illicit-drug strategy includes a programme for the development of frontier areas and national races. This programme  which places particular emphasis on infrastructure-building  crop substitution  livestock breeding and the overall alleviation of socio-economic conditions in border areas  is making a perceptible impact on the all-round development of rural areas in 44 townships in the border region.  In parallel with these national efforts  Myanmar has already established close co-operative agreements with two of our neighbouring countries  China and Thailand. These arrangements include exchanges of information on drug trafficking and related activities along our common borders  training of law-enforcement personnel and transfer of technology. They complement and reinforce each country’s national drug-control programmes and activities. Plans are well in hand to establish similar co-operative arrangements with another neighbouring country  the Lao People's Democratic Republic. These endeavours are currently being undertaken on a bilateral basis but are expected to develop into a broader co-operative arrangement at the subregional level.In view of the progress achieved thus far and of the definite plans and programmes which we will be energetically carrying out in the future  we have ample reason to visualise the total eradication of poppy cultivation and of the menace of illicit drugs in Myanmar  in the shortest possible time On 27 Nay 1990  the first multi-party general elections in nearly three decades were successfully held in my country in response to the ardent wishes and aspirations of the people Myanmar. This historic event constitutes the fulfilment of the solemn promise made by the State Law and Order Restoration Council on the very first day of its assumption of national responsibility  and reaffirmed on numerous subsequent occasions. The elections were held in strict observance of the election Law and Rules  under the supervision of an independent five-member Election Commission. The fact that the elections were genuinely free and fair  beyond any doubt  was universally recognised by all the political parties which contested the elections and by a large group of journalists  representing 32 news agencies  who observed the elations at first hand.In a remarkably high turn-out  72.59 per cent of eligible voters went to the polls on election day and exercised one of the most fundamental human rights  that is  their right to elect National Assembly representatives of their choice  without lat or hindrance.Having fulfilled its promise to hold free and fair multi-party elections  the State Law and Order Restoration Council is now taking firm steps systematically and step by step - towards the establishment of a stable and enduring democratic State.Questions have been raised in some quarters regarding transfer of power to a democratically elected Government in my country. In this connection  I should like to stress that our leaders have given assurances on several occasions that the State Law and Order Restoration Council will hand over power in due course to a strong and stable Government that is to be formed in accordance with a new constitution to be drafted.Those who have raised such questions do not seem to be aware of the due process of law that is now taking place in Myanmar in accordance with the Election Law. Under the relevant provisions of the Law  a number of candidates have filed objections with the Election Commission against their opponents. Both the petitioners and the respondents represent a broad cross-section of political parties  including the National League for Democracy  the National Unity Party and some independents. The Government has thus far set up five tribunals  with widely respected retired law officers and civil service personnel  to investigate these objections. The tribunals are presently conducting their court proceedings and hearings. This dies process must be allowed to complete its course; those petitioners exercising their rights cannot be denied their rights.A strong and stable government presupposes a strong and enduring constitution. The next indispensable step  therefore  is the drafting of such a constitution in order to lay a solid foundation for a democratic State  to which the people of Myanmar aspire.The new constitution needs to be drafted with great care in order to ensure that the shortcomings and loopholes of the old constitution of 1947  which was drawn up before Myanmar became independent  do not find their way into the new instrument.Needless to say  it must be elaborated meticulously  comprehensively  systematically. It must be based on national consensus and must be acceptable to the majority of the people of Myanmar as well as to the majority of the national races living in the Union. To that end  the authorities are taking all necessary measures  step by step  and plan to meet with the elected representatives of the National Assembly. A broadly based national convention will be convened to discuss all factors that should be taken into account in drafting the new Constitution. Its drafting will be the responsibility of the elected representatives. The State Law and Order Restoration Council and the Defence Services will do their outmost to assist them in this task.Until such time as a firm  constitutionally established government comes into existence  the State Law and Order Restoration Council will continue to fulfil its national responsibilities  the most important of which is to safeguard the three cardinal national causes  namely  to prevent the disintegration of the Union  to ensure the non-disintegration of national solidarity and to ensure the perpetuity of our country's sovereignty. Myanmar is known for its unique culture  whose hallmarks are tolerance and compassion. This cultural environment underpins respect for human rights  which not only are protected by law but are also observed in practice as a matter of tradition. Discrimination  be it on grounds of race  religion or sex  is a non-existent in my country.We have been co-operating closely with the Commission on Human Sights  its subsidiary bodies and the Centre for Human Sights in Geneva  and have been providing information to them on the situation of human rights in our country. We shall continue to do so in the future. Let me take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that the Government of Myanmar has agreed to  and indeed welcomes  the visit to our country of Professor Sadako Ogata  an independent expert appointed by the Commission on Human Sights. She will shortly be arriving in Myanmar to carry out her mandate.Questions have been raised in certain quarters concerning the restraint placed on certain individuals in my country. As we have clarified on numerous occasions  legal action has been taken against those persons not for their political activities but for their infringement of the existing laws of the land. I should like to emphasise that a line must be drawn between respect for human rights  on the one hand  and maintenance of law and public order in accordance with existing laws  on the other. Every Government has the primary responsibility to maintain law and order in its country and to prevent anarchy and disorder. I might add that the actions taken against the persons in question are the most lenient prescribed by our laws  even though the acts perpetrated by them  which include instigating the general public to defy the legal authority and forming a parallel government  make them liable to much sterner penalties under our criminal laws. I hardly need to stress here that our national undertaking to establish a peaceful and prosperous multi-party democratic State must be accomplished by the people of Myanmar themselves in accordance with Myanmar's outlook and in the Myanmar way  so as to suit our nation's own specific conditions and circumstances. The international community can best help that process by refraining from interfering or bringing pressure to bear in any shape or form and by letting the people of Myanmar proceed along their own path until they reach their chosen destiny of a free and democratic State.

"97",4765,"MNG",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Mongolian delegation  I should like to offer Mr. De Marco our sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the lofty post of President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session and to wish his every success in the performance of his important duties. His election is a tribute to his personal qualities as an outstanding statesman of Malta  and also to the widely recognised and active contribution of his country to the work of the United Nations.The Mongolian delegation also pays a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Garba of Nigeria  for his skilled guidance of the work of the forty-fourth regular session and the three special sessions of the General Assembly  which dealt with very important problems of our day. We warmly congratulate the delegation of Liechtenstein on the accession to the United Nations and we wish them every success in their noble work.  The work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly has begun at a most significant moment in history. The year drawing to a close has on the whole fostered the positive breaks that have emerged of late. This year's historic events have made it a watershed. The cold war is over  a new era in international relations  based on the active  peaceful co- existence of States in conditions of interdependence  has began  following the United States-Soviet Union summit meeting in Malta  the global confrontation between those two countries has virtually given way to an enlightened partnership. The level of confidence and Mutual understanding between East and Nest has been raised to new heights. Europe has made great strides towards unification. Positive results can be observed in the settlement of some regional conflicts  k constructive search is continuing in various areas of the disarmament process. The role of the United Nations as a major instrument of peace  collective security and international cooperation  is ever-expanding. Namibia has gained the independence for which it fought so long.  Despite these radical changes  we must however note the lack of tangible progress in resolving а number of global and regional problems such as underdevelopment  the external debt ecological imbalance and the crisis in the Middle last among others. Moreover  a new and highly dangerous source of tension has emerged. In short  today’s world is quite contradictory and an intensification of efforts to reinforce the positive trends and find optimal solutions to existing problems  still remains an urgent task of the world community.In Europe  the normalisation of international relations on the regional level is continuing. Events of historic magnitude have taken place recently. The countries of Eastern Europe have taken a decisive step towards democratisation and renewal of their societies  λ united Germany has emerged. The Helsinki process is gaining new momentum. The Mongolian People’s Republic welcomes the convening in Paris  in November  of the summit meeting of the countries participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We expect that one of its most important results will be the conclusion of an agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments on the European continent.The successful advancement of the all-European process and the changing nature of the relations between the two largest military and political groupings are bringing about an improvement in the overall political climate and are helping to prepare solid ground for new and concrete steps towards disarmament.We are encouraged by the recent statements of the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States to the effect that they will put forth new efforts with a view to completing  as early as this year  the agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive armaments. Mongolia would also like to see the early conclusion of the convention on banning chemical weapons.The Mongolian delegation shares the concern over the lack of progress towards an agreement on the complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. The strengthening of the non-proliferation regime and the cessation of the technological arms race are assuming ever greater importance. The Mongolian Republic believes that disarmament measures  including those relating to conversion  should be carried out in close conjunction with development efforts.The Asia-Pacific region has been attracting increasing attention from the world community  especially of late. Though the development of events is quite complex  we view the general political situation in the region as positive. This is reflected  in particular in the growing willingness of the countries of the region to engage in dialogue and co-operation  and in the increasing trust and mutual understanding among them. In other words  the times when ideological and other differences stood in the way of greater co-operation are fading away.New and earnest steps are being taken to resolve some of the regional conflicts. Mongolia welcomes the steps taken towards a final settlement of the Cambodian conflict  namely  the agreement reached by the five permanent members of the Security Council on the framework for its settlement  the acceptance of relevant documents by the Cambodian parties  and the formation of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia. In this regard  the efforts made by the United Nations and all the countries concerned are highly commendable.Certain encouraging signs can be discerned on the Korean peninsula as well. We are hopeful that the inter-Korean dialogue  launched at the level of Prime Ministers  will create favourable conditions for enhancing mutual confidence  reducing confrontation on the peninsula and attaining the ultimate objective of the reunification of Korea. Mongolia continues to favour the earliest possible solution of the Afghan problem. An immediate end must be put to the continuing bloodshed in that country and international efforts to that end should be intensified. In our view  the policy of national reconciliation and unity pursued by the Afghan Government paves the way for the opening of the inter-Afghan dialogue.To our great regret  the situation in another area of the Asian continent - the Middle East - has been seriously aggravated by Iraq's open aggression against Kuwait. Mongolia fully supports the measures taken by the Security Council and a number of States to restore justice and the rights of the Kuwaiti people  which have been trampled upon. We consider that this problem should be resolved exclusively by political means.The current explosive situation in the Persian Gulf has again clearly shown the need for an early settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East. A just and comprehensive settlement of this problem can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of the rights of all the peoples and countries of the region to exist and the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.Apart from specific regional problems  there are a number of regional issues of common concern in Asia.There is a great disparity in the level of the development of the countries of the region. The process of integration among them is uneven and is  to a great extent  underdeveloped. Many countries of the Asia-Pacific region suffer from economic backwardness and from ecological and other serious problems.The existing problems and conflicts can be resolved  first  through joint efforts on the part of interested parties and States of the region. In our view  therefore  it is highly important for the countries of the Asia-Pacific region to formulate their owe pattern of interaction  while taking into account the positive experience of other regions. Here  we should like to express our support for the Soviet idea of holding a widely representative forum of Asian States.The resolution of a specific problem would  apparently  call for a specific approach - a specific group of participants and so on. Meanwhile  it is important to have a general  constructive background based on mutual confidence and understanding on a regional scale and  in our view  this involves mutual confidence and understanding on a regional scale. This would call for a display of good will and the development of broad co-operation on both a regional and a subregional basis.9fe therefore welcome the emergence of various regional structures for co-operation. It is important that they should be open-ended. The establishment last year of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Organisation with the participation of 12 States was  in our view  a very important step in the development of Asia-Pacific integration. Mongolia is most interested in participating in the activities of that Organisation.Believing in the importance of a regional approach to the solution of common problems  Mongolia last year made a proposal that  together  we should seek a mechanism for dialogue among the countries of the northern part of the Asia-Pacific region. I would emphasise here that we are not talking about the establishment of any kind of new organisational structure. We are merely suggesting the organisation of periodic meetings of representatives of the countries of the subregion at various levels. Such meetings would help  in our view  to identify the problems existing in the region and would suggest ways and means of resolving them. We view the implementation of our idea in the context of other initiatives put forward by other countries of the region and we will be glad to co-operate with interested parties. The proclamation of a new and independent Namibia bas undoubtedly been one of the most important event  of this year. This was a major achievement of the United Nations and of all democratic and anti-colonialist forces. It is symbolic that the elimination of the last major colonial stain on Earth coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and People  which will be celebrated at this session of the General Assembly. We believe that this anniversary gives the entire international community a timely opportunity to sum up the activities of the United Nations on decolonisation.Positive changes are also taking place in South Africa itself. He hope that the negotiations between the South African authorities and the African National Congress of South Africa will lead to positive results and to the ultimate elimination of the system of apartheid and the creation of a new democratic  non-racial State in the southern part of Africa.The Mongolian People's Republic shares the deep concern expressed in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organisation in regard to the difficult economic situation in the overwhelming majority of the developing countries.We favour  above all  the intensification within the United Nations of a global dialogue on all the main components of world trade and economic relations. The convening this year of the special session of the General Assembly on economic issues and of the Second United Nation  Conference on the Least-Developed Countries we  of great importance.In our opinion  the Declaration adopted at the special session and the global consensus  reached thereby on way  and means of developing international economic co-operation lay the foundations for a constructive dialogue with a view to the solution of world economic problems  above all those problems confronting the developing countries. The International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade should greatly facilitate the solution of the problems outlined above.One important task is the creation of an international environment for accelerating economic growth and securing the sustained development of the developing countries. In this context I should like to underline the importance of giving the developing countries broader access to the achievements of scientific and technical progress.An early settlement in a spirit of justice and solidarity of the problems of external indebtedness and international trade would greatly help the developing countries to overcome the economic crisis. The Mongolian delegation shares the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the South Commission of the Group of 77.The deterioration in the world ecological situation constitutes a serious international problem  one that requires close co-operation on both a global and a regional level. The Mongolian People's Republic hopes that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Brazil in 1992  will become an important landmark in the efforts of States to preserve the ecosystem of our planet.Mongolia welcomes the outcome of the World Summit for Children held recently at the United Nations. In our country appropriate measures will be taken to translate into practical action the spirit and provisions of the World Declaration on the Survival  Protection and Development of Children and its Plan of Action for the 19908  as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Mongolia today is experiencing a dynamic period of democratisation in its political  economic and spiritual life  a multiparty system has been established and is functioning. The first democratic and free elections have been held  a permanently functioning parliament has been set up. The presidential form of government has been introduced. Freedom of the press is being ensured. The right to emigrate freely and the right to freedom of religion and the performance of religious rites are being guaranteed. Many lost traditions and customs are being revived.In its economic policy ray Government is placing primary emphasis on the social aspect  a programme is being drawn up for the transition to a market economy. The equality of various forms of property  including private property  will be guaranteed by law. An open economic policy is being pursued  a law has been adopted on foreign investment.Mongolia has recently become a member of the Asian Development Bank. We are taking steps to join the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank and other international financial and economic institutions.The country's foreign policy has been freed from ideological prejudices  a policy of non-alignment  a policy of maintaining friendly and equitable relations with any country  is being actively pursued. We advocate the principle of the non-deployment of troops and military bases on foreign territories. In accordance with a bilateral agreement  the withdrawal of the remaining part of Soviet troops from Mongolia will be completed by the summer of 1992.We have undertaken the work of bringing our national legislation into conformity with our international obligations and of withdrawing reservations made earlier in regard to some multilateral treaties and conventions. I believe that this is in keeping with the task of ensuring the primacy of law and the objectives of the United Nations Decade of International Law proclaimed last year.In conclusion  the Mongolian delegation expresses the hope that this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly will make its own contribution to the solution of the pressing issues of today and to the consolidation of positive trends in the world. We wish to pay a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts and outstanding public service in enhancing the peace-making role of our Organisation. We wish him all further success."
"98",4807,"MOZ",45,1990,"﻿It is with pleasure and satisfaction that  on my own behalf and on behalf of my delegation  I congratulate his Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We wish you  Sir  much success in fulfilling your important functions. Your election to this important office demonstrates the great prestige that your country  Malta  enjoys in the international community and the trust we all place in you and in your outstanding qualities. We are sure that under your leadership the deliberations of this session will have a successful outcome. We stand ready to co-operate with you and give you all the support within our power towards the successful attainment of this objective.I should also like to convey to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Garba  the satisfaction and appreciation of the Mozambican delegation for the able manner in which he presided over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  as well as over the special sessions that took place during his mandate. Our renewed congratulations go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on his creativity and dynamic leadership and on his commitment to the search for an adequate solution to the various problems threatening peace  progress  development and the welfare of all peoples.An event of transcendent importance marked the period that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly: the independence of Namibia. It was with joy and emotion that we witnessed the assumption of the reins of sovereignty and self-determination by the people of the sister nation of Namibia. The accession to independence of that African country was the culmination of a long and heroic march of resistance and struggle by the people of Namibia against the colonial occupation. It was a victory for all mankind; the corollary and the final outcome of decades of joint effort on the part of the people of Namibia and of all peace-loving forces. It marked the downfall of the last stronghold of colonialism on the African continent.I associate myself with the previous speakers in extending a special welcome to the delegation of independent Namibia. The independence of Namibia has widened the frontiers of freedom and strengthened the community of free and sovereign nations in the world. We welcome as well the admission of the Principality of Liechtenstein as the 160th Member of our Organisation. The accession of that Principality to the United Nations makes our family stronger and constitutes a further step towards wider universality of our Organisation.The forty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of both hope and apprehension for our planet. While  on the one hand  we witness with joy and satisfaction the dawn of an era of openness  interdependence and co-operation among nations  and are happy to see a reinforcement of democratic practices in various parts of the world  on the other  we are also witnessing the emergence  with the unusual vehemence  of unacceptable attitudes and behaviour  which create dangerous pockets of tension and threaten the fragile achievements so far made by mankind towards relaxation and disarmament. At a time when peace efforts have become a driving force shared by all of us  and when dialogue is given important weight in the solution of the world's conflicts the explosive situation that has arisen in the Gulf is of great concern to us.  Serious events  whose catastrophic consequences are already being felt in each one of our countries  are taking place in the region. The invasion  occupation and annexation of Kuwait are unacceptable. We demand respect for the norms of international law and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty. We urge that a peaceful platform be found to put an end to the spectre of war that hangs over the region  in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.As to the problem in the Middle East  we realise that the rights of the Palestinian people continue to be violated. We reiterate our belief in the need for the convening of an international conference with the participation of all the concerned parties including the State of Palestine.We feel encouraged by the progress achieved towards a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kampuchea. We strongly believe that the United Nations could play a vital role in the solution of this problem.In East Timor  the Maubere people continue to be deprived of their right to independence and self-determination. We encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts towards the achievement of an acceptable solution to this problem  which must necessarily be based on respect for the fundamental rights of the people of East Timor.With respect to the question of Western Sahara  we welcome the steps taken by the Secretary-General with a view to a peaceful and definitive solution to this conflict  and we encourage him to pursue this effort without hesitation. In the Korean peninsula  we encourage the current efforts being made towards a peaceful reunification of the Korean nation. The high-level meetings recently held between the two Koreas constitute a positive step in this direction.In the period under consideration  Europe has witnessed far-reaching political and economic developments  of which it is worth pointing out the changes in Eastern Europe and the agreement on German reunification.In southern Africa  we are encouraged by the decisions taken by the Government of President De Klerk in South Africa. The release of Nelson Mandela  the historic leader of the South African people  and that of some of his compatriots  as well as the legalisation of all South African political and democratic organisations that had been banned until then  the lifting of the state of emergency  and the preliminary talks between the Government and the African National Congress (ANC)  open up new horizons in the history of South African politics.Those changes  which are the result of the sacrifice and relentless struggle of the South African people  of Africa and of the international community as a whole are the harbingers of hope in a more stable  peaceful and promising future for the development of southern Africa. We await with hope the beginning of constitutional negotiations among the South African authorities  the ANC and other South African democratic forces. It continues to be necessary for the international community to play a crucial role in the efforts for the eradication of the apartheid system within the framework of the premises contained in the Declaration  adopted at the sixteenth special session  on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa.We urge President De Klerk and his Government to pursue with courage and determination the path they have embarked upon. Mozambique will continue to contribute in whatever manner nay be necessary to guarantee the success of this great and lofty undertaking. However  we note with great concern the wave of violence that has been occurring in South Africa recently. We praise the maturity and the sense of responsibility shown by the AHC in the person of its Vice-President  Nelson Mandela  in trying to put an end to this violence.We point out the inherent danger of the extremist attitudes of those who want at all costs to perpetuate the system of apartheid. We urge the South African Government to commit itself forcefully to the elimination of the causes behind this climate of tension.In Angola  we acknowledge with satisfaction the steps undertaken by the Government through peaceful means to put an end to the war that is devastating our sisterly nation. Those efforts should be supported by the international community  so that they may lead to peace and national harmony. In Mozambique  our country  the end of the war and a return to tranquillity  and to a normal life for all Mozambicans  constitutes the chief priority of our government and of the FRELIMO Party. The senseless war of sabotage and destruction still ravages our country  continues to take its toll in human lives and cause enormous damage to property. As a direct result of this indiscriminate destruction carried out by RENAMO  thousands of Mozambicans have been displaced  both within and outside their country  deprived of their possessions  reduced to extreme poverty  and are surviving only thanks to the generous assistance of their countrymen and of the international community. The economic and social emergency we are experiencing in our country is just one of the dramatic facets of the consequences of this unjustified war. Schools  kindergartens  health centres and a number of economic infrastructures have been destroyed  leaving hundreds of thousands of people without access to education and health care facilities.Despite its positive results  the economic recovery programme begun in 1987  with broad support from the international community  is confronted with the negative effects of continued acts of destabilisation  which hinder its full implementation  especially in the rural areas. Efforts by the Government  with the support of the international community  to save the lives of millions of Mozambicans in an emergency situation have been hampered by RENAMO armed action against populations and against economic and social targets. Our commitment to defend our country does not prevent the Government from seeking peaceful ways of putting an end to the war  as we believe that everything should be done to bring about an honourable and dignifying peace in our country.We have had an opportunity in the past to inform the international community about the principles set by the Government as a basis for the dialogue with RENAMO and about the indirect contacts we had undertaken  with the support of the mediators  with a view to creating a climate conducive to direct dialogue. Through this dialogue  the Government seeks to achieve the cessation of violence  the restoration of peace throughout the country and national reconciliation. We want a genuine and lasting peace  a peace built upon national unity and stability. We seek a peace which upholds our national interests  a peace brought about by Mozambican for the benefit of the Mozambican people.In spite of these significant efforts  RENAMO continues to use delaying tactics  thus protracting the negotiations. Such manoeuvres do not serve the supreme interests of the Mozambican nation and serve only to prolong unnecessarily the suffering of our people.The Government continues  however  to be committed to pursue direct dialogue and to surmount any real obstacles it may encounter along the way. We are prepared to discuss any issue of substance that may bring us to the fulfilment of the just expectations of our people. 'There is no valid reason for the continuation of the war in Mozambique. In spite of the war situation prevailing in the country  the FRELIMO Party has spared no effort in its attempt to find better ways of organising Mozambican society and ensuring the people's real and effective participation in formulating and deciding on the destiny of the nation. It was in the light of this that the debate on the draft amended Constitution was concluded last July. This debate allowed for the people to express their views on the future of the country. Millions of Mozambicans  including Koaarabican communities abroad  aired their views in a spirit of unity  openness and frankness  with dignity  pride and patriotism  on the issues of national interest. The people also expressed their views on the nature of the political system they want to see established in the country.An analysis of the contributions made in the course of the discussion enables us to grasp and portray the interests and aspirations of the people at the present stage. In addition  it has enabled us to opt for a multiparty political system in our country and for the formulation of the various national policies which are contained in the draft Constitution that is to be submitted within a few days to the people's Assembly for adoption. The endorsement of the new Constitution will be followed by presidential and legislative elections through direct universal suffrage in 1991. The introduction of the multiparty political system in Mozambique is subject to the observance of certain criteria which shall be subjected to a specific law to be passed in due course by the people's Assembly. Such criteria stipulate inter alia that a political party shall be constituted on the basis of tribe  race  religion or other factors likely to undermine national unity or lead to the fragmentation of Mozambican society. They further stipulate that the parties shall defend national interests and the independence and sovereignty of the Mozambican State.While recommending the introduction of the multiparty system in the country  the FRELIMO Party is aware of the fact that the multiparty system per se does not necessarily mean democracy. According to our understanding  democracy implies the participation of the people in the mapping out of decisions on the destiny of the nation and in the exercise of sovereignty by the people.The current climate of detente and dialogue  together with the increasing political changes occurring in the world and the growing consensus on the policies to be adopted for development strategies  calls for the greater democratization of international economic relations  which will allow the countries of the South to benefit from advances in science and the new technologies for the progress and prosperity of all peoples of the world.We recognise that  although solutions have been progressively found to political conflicts  the handling of matters related to the problems of development  which are pervasive in the majority of our countries  is hindered by a considerable degree of apathy and sluggishness.The structural changes occurring in the world economic system  as well as the increasing interdependence which results there from  should create new opportunities for encouraging economic growth in the developing countries  instead of widening the gap that separates them from industrialised countries.We are aware of the responsibility that we should shoulder as the main players in the development processes of our own countries. We would call for greater understanding and sensitivity to the nature of the difficulties that form a stumbling-block to our development. It is urgent that the flow of capital for development be increased and made available in such a way as to permit the financial and material means to be applied for expansion  diversification and modernisation of the productive sectors of the economy.We would like to seize this opportunity to welcome the report of the South Commission  whose release has recently been announced by its Chairman  His Excellency Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere. This report  in view of its in-depth analysis of the economic situation in the developing countries and its recommendations  constitutes a valuable contribution not just to the problems confronting the developing countries but also to the improvement in North-South relations.We urge the States Members of this Organisation jointly to work out ways and means of implementing the guidelines of this report.The foreign debt crisis remains one of the main obstacles to our economic growth and development. It is extremely important that a constructive dialogue between debtors and creditors be established  with a view to finding definitive solutions to the problem. We take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the various creditor countries which took concrete measures to alleviate the debt burden of Mozambique and that of some other countries with great economic difficulties.Another challenge faced by the international community is the problem of protection of the environment. Here too the future of mankind is in our hands. We urge everyone to be fully involved in the preparations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Brazil in 1992.In a few days the international community will witness an unparalleled event  the summit for children. The presence of many Heads of State and Government and illustrious dignitaries at this meeting is a testimony to our common willingness to join forces in the search for solutions to the problems that threaten the future o£ the coming generations.We have the responsibility to create a future of harmony and peace for our children  who are the citizens of tomorrow. Children are a source of inspiration to us and a prime challenge to our actions; they should be offered something rare in our generation  that is  peace  stability  harmony and development.We believe that this summit will strengthen our determination to preserve the current trend in international relations by defending the lofty ideals which presided over the birth of our Organization.We are pleased to note the trend in present international relations  the revitalisation of the role of the United Nations that makes it the centre around which solutions are sought to the serious problems affecting mankind  such as regional conflicts and wars.Our Organization assumes a universal dimension today. This dimension however  cannot just be measured through the rise in the number of its Members  but also  and mainly  in accordance with the extent to which the values  principles and objectives it pursues are universally upheld.Co-operation  solidarity and the new emerging consensus at the international level constitute the most eloquent example of this. It is our understanding that this new trend in international relations should not be an instrument for the management of selected crises  but a systematic policy to confront the countless challenges in the world  namely  underdevelopment  poverty  endemic diseases  AIDS  drugs and environmental problems  to name just a few.We would like to conclude by reiterating our confidence in the ability of the United Nations successfully to face these challenges. It remains the most privileged forum for the solution of the economic and social development problems of peoples and for the promotion of international peace and security."
"99",4852,"MRT",45,1990,"﻿Allow me first of all to extend to you the Mauritanian delegation's warmest congratulations on your election to the Presidency of our General Assembly. This election  which is a tribute to your personal qualities  also reflects the esteem enjoyed by your country  Malta  on the international level. I would also like to assure you of our full co-operation in your discharge of your important duties.To your predecessor  our brother  Joseph Garba  from our sister republic  Nigeria  we pay a well-deserved tribute for the exemplary way in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session.We should also like to congratulate our Secretary-General  Javier Peres de Cuellar  whose dedication and perseverance in the service of the ideals of peace  justice and equality embodied by our Organisation are recognized by all. We reaffirm our firm support in his constant quest for international peace and security and to ensure respect for human rights and the rights of peoples.We welcome also the presence amongst us of the delegation of the Principality of Liechtenstein and extend our warm congratulations on their admission to the United Nations.The world today is undergoing profound changes. The extent and consequences of those changes will shape the future of humankind. Though there has been progress towards international detente  serious tensions still remain. Those tensions are kept alive by the lack of justice which is rampant in the world both on the economics and information levels.My country has been a victim of such injustice. In its dispute with Senegal  my country fell victim to a tendentious campaign of misinformation which was meant to cover up the serious violations of human rights suffered by the Mauritanian subjects  and distort the facts  thus making it much more difficult to reach a settlement.I think  however  that the movement in some situations gives us room to hope for a better world. In Africa  the independence of Namibia is a victory for peace and justice. We welcome our Namibian brethren to the United Nations family.In South Africa  the dialogue now begun between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the authorities gives us hope that the apartheid system will be dismantled and  in its place  a democratic society that is free from all forms of racial discrimination will arise.In the Arabian Peninsula  we have noted with satisfaction the unification of the people of Yemen. By achieving this unity  the two States have given a pioneering example to the Arab nation.In Asia  we follow with interest the process under way towards the resolution of the Cambodian problem. In this respect  we call on all the parties to continue to show understanding. Nothing else can make it possible for their people to live in peace with themselves and with their neighbours.The recent contacts between the two Koreas give us hope that the Korean people will in their turn rediscover unity.In Europe  the fall of the Berlin Hall has eliminated a symbol of confrontation and suspicion between peoples and has brought about the realization Mauritania of the aspirations of the German people  who even today are celebrating their new-found national unity. We congratulate them on it and give then our best wishes.Despite this general movement towards conciliation in relations between States  situations of conflict continue to occur and develop. In the Arab Gulf  the events of the last few months are cause for extreme disquiet. For our part  -  Mauritania reaffirms its adherence to the United Nations Charter and international law  as indicated in the letter to this effect which it has addressed to the Secretary-General. Mauritania condemns any use of force to settle differences between States  and rejects the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. Mauritania deplores any measure which would have the effect of threatening security or depriving innocent people  whatever their nationality  of their freedom.Mauritania's wish is for a satisfactory solution to this crisis to be found in an Arab contest. This is the only contest that would guarantee lasting peace and harmony in the region. If only the Arab approach  in the context of which the Jeddah meeting between Iraq and Kuwait took place  had been pursued after 2 August  it might have made it possible to avoid the deadlock we now face. However  in the very first days of the crisis  we witnessed a sizeable  steady build-up of foreign military forces in the region.Those who would resort to force in dealing with this crisis will bear α serious responsibility before history  because the conflict that would erupt will prove impossible to contain.In any case  while reiterating our commitment to international law and relevant United Nations resolutions  my country deems it unacceptable and inhuman that there should be any action that aims at depriving an entire population of food and medication.In the Middle East  Israel still occupies the Arab territories and continues to oppress the Palestinian people in violation of international law. The courageous decisions of the Palestine National Council and the peace initiative taken by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have been blocked by Israeli intransigence. The suspension of the cautious dialogue between the United States of America and the PLO has been another great disappointment to all those who had hoped for a peaceful solution to this human tragedy.However  the heroic Palestinian people's intifadah has demonstrated that people's ability to mobilize itself and showed its determination to regain its rights. It is not conceivable that a world that loves justice and cherishes international law should continue to acquiesce in the daily trampling under foot in Palestine of the most basic of human rights.In Lebanon  the instability of the situation persists because of the combined impact of domestic conditions and external pressures. For its part  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania considers that the Taif agreement provides the appropriate framework for the resolution of Lebanon's domestic problems and the restoration of its civil peace.In Afghanistan  we regret the tragic infighting between brethren that has continued unabated after the withdrawal of foreign forces. We hope that our Afghan brethren will rise above their differences and achieve unity free from foreign interference.In the Arab Maghreb  the final settlement of the question of the Western Sahara will enable the Arab Maghreb Union to consolidate its political cohesiveness and economic integration. We renew our full support of the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts to find a solution to the conflict.Efforts to improve the international political climate will be fruitless unless a solution is found for the economic crisis of the developing countries  especially those in Africa  where the situation is particularly difficult.We commend the efforts of the United Nations and the World Bank in the areas of information and mobilisation.Thanks to these efforts  the recent Paris United Nations Conference on the least developed countries has resulted in pledges that will give impetus to our development efforts and strengthen our hands in facing up to the consequences of a deteriorating economic situation which has been aggravated  in the case of my country  by the effects of 20 years of drought and the arrival en masse in May 1989 of totally dispossessed refugees and repatriates. The number of those people exceeded 10 per cent of our total population.Despite the difficulties inherent in such a situation and the scarcity of external aid  some of which has stopped  due to the current economic situation or because of political considerations relating to the events in the Gulf  the policy of my country under the guidance of President Maouya Quid Sid'Ahmed Taya continues its efforts to meet the needs of our people and  at the same time  pursue three main objectives that are essential to our development  namely:First  the setting up of democratic institutions. For that purpose  free and democratic elections were organized in the course of the past four years to elect representatives that run local affairs. Elections will take place throughout the country before the end of the year. These elections are an important step towards the shouldering by the people of their national responsibilities in conducting their affairs democratically.Secondly  the eradication by the year 2000 of illiteracy  which is the scourge that afflicts a high percentage of the Mauritanian people. Considerable efforts are currently under way to achieve this ambitious target without which no development will be possible.Thirdly  the participation of women in all the activities required by national construction. Women  who account for more than 50 per cent of the population  are given every attention in the formulation of our education  health and employment plans.I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank all the countries  international institutions and non-governmental organizations which have given and continue to assist us in protecting our environment  developing our resources end mitigating the social effects of the crisis.The world today is at an historic juncture  and it is up to the United Nations  which embodies the unanimity of all  to ensure the triumph of good over evil. Peace and freedom are legitimate aspirations for all and all peoples deserve them equally without discrimination. The United Nations is duty-bound to give the same weight to all its resolutions.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has faith ¿n the ideals enshrined in our Organization's principles and will always respect those principles. "
"100",4898,"MUS",45,1990,"﻿We are delighted that the forty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly is being presided over by a distinguished personally fro  Malta  an island whose active involvement in international affairs is well known and which  like Mauritius  has been the crossroads of many civilisations.I AM confident  Mr. President  that the experience end wisdom you bring to this high office will enrich our deliberations and help us uphold the principles of our Organisation during these trying times when the security of swell nations is being threatened.Addressing the Assembly for the first time  I am personally pleased to say how proud we are to belong to an Organisation which today commands respect and authority. As a representative of a small  open  democratic and multiracial State without any defence abilities I find cause for satisfaction in the knowledge that membership in this Organization is not a vain hope and that the United Nations has the capacity to safeguard international law. It is comforting to note that our Organisation  besides having the duty to assert the law  has also the ability to enforce it and to uphold respect for the right of States  small and large and from the North and the South  to exist in peace and harmony.It cannot be sufficiently emphasised that this newly found ability will bring to small Member States - which  after all  form the majority of the membership of this Organisation - a sense of security based on the right to exist peacefully  as enshrined in our Charter. I do not think it unfair to recall that such a situation is relatively new. Recent history abounds with examples where the international community was sadly incapable not only of clearly enunciating the law but also of assuming its obligations and ensuring that these rules  approved by all  were respected Freer now of these past constraints  of which snail States were often the unwilling instruments  our Organisation  with its new-found unity  its new cohesion  has today the means to fulfil its primary objective.On the other hand let us not forget that the apparent cohesion of the international community and the will displayed by the United Nations are still precarious. We might ask ourselves whether the unprecedented demonstration of international solidarity in the present Gulf crisis is not motivated as much by vested interests as by respect for international law.It is imperative therefore that we display a renewed sense of our attachment to our fundamental principles wherever and whenever the law is infringed. Let it be recorded that the United Nations has already to its credit the efficient settlement of serious conflicts  and here we should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the seal  dedication and vision he displays as head of our Organization.Unfortunately  unresolved crises still cast a shadow on the good faith of our Organisation. Inequality among peoples still abounds across the world. The Palestinians  Lebanese  Fijians  oppressed by brutal and inhuman forces  certainly deserve the same solidarity as we are today expressing towards the Kuwaiti people.Imbued with this ideal  Mauritius has firmly condemned the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and we join in the appeals that have been made for the restoration of the territorial Integrity and sovereignty of Kuwait. We have entertained good relations with both countries. Kuwait used to supply us with half our petroleum needs. Our political and diplomatic relations with Iraq have been friendly. Although peace appears illusive  we nurture the hope that reconciliation will avert say breakout of military hostilities. Let us give diplomacy a chance and thus avoid the dire consequences for the Hear East and the rest of the world.The conflict in the Gulf region seemed even more aberrant at a time when momentous events in Europe and elsewhere towards peace and reconciliation were occurring. The new bonds of friendship that have been woven between the USSR and the United States of America  inspired by President Gorbachev and President Bush  the end of the cold war era and of ideological conflicts  the triumph of liberty and democracy around the world have raised hopes for a new phase of development based on peace. Poorer countries  relieved of the burden of prosy wars that diverted much of their slender resources  will now be more able to address priority tasks in the struggle against underdevelopment and poverty. Alas  the Gulf crisis rudely brought us back to reality. The end of the East-West conflict could well be succeeded by an era of lawlessness jeopardising the security of small States in the face of ambitious designs of powerfully armed neighbours and adversaries.All too often our desire for global solutions has not been matched by political will. Up to now international negotiations on economic and development issues  on trade  the debt problem and the environment have resulted in protracted debates but few genuine breakthroughs. As the world is overtaken by the pace of history  nations seem to fall back on old reflexes.Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the field of disarmament and security  where the threat of war and aggression remains. In the emerging multipolar world  smaller States are especially vulnerable to such a threat. The capacity of some States to acquire huge and modern arsenals for use in regional conflicts will constitute one of the greatest threats to the security of smaller States. Positive development such as the conclusion of the 1987 Treaty on Intermediate range nuclear missiles  the talks on strategic arms reduction  and the decrease of conventional forces in Europe are encouraging. She international community should not overlook the real dangers to peace posed at a regional level and should address the  in a concrete way.In this regard my delegation wishes to reiterate its commitment to the creation of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. My government regrets the withdrawal of the major Western Powers from the Ad Hос Committee on the Indian Ocean at a time when real progress was at hand  and we express the hope that recent events in the Gulf region will convince them of the urgent necessity of working towards the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.Those who appeal to world solidarity and support in tines of trial cannot afford to ignore the just aspirations of smaller nations to peace. Countries of the region should recognise that a degree of flexibility might be necessary to overcome controversial issues and advance the cause of peace and security in our part of the world. The efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee at this juncture should not be undermined  and all avenues for progress must remain open.Genuine negotiations on a zone of peace would lead to significant progress in other areas  such as that of naval disarmament. Confidence- and security-building measures would reduce the risks of incidents and confrontations at sea and would enhance the security of coastal States and contribute to a safer regional environment.While we are addressing the issue of the Indian Ocean  we wish to reiterate our just and rightful claim to the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  and express our deep appreciation of the whole-hearted support of the members of the Ron-Aligned Movement and the Organisation of African Unity  as well as that of other friendly countries. We also attach great importance to current negotiation  within the Review Conference on the nuclear-non-proliferation Treaty and its eventual extension in 1995. At a time when Modern armament is increasingly multidimensional and technologically advanced  the proliferation of nuclear weapons constitutes a Major threat to the security of all States.Nuclear-weapon States should therefore demonstrate greater willingness to reduce their arsenals and commit themselves to a process of disarmament by offering  in addition  specific security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States. Similarly  restraint and control should be exercised for other weapons of arms destruction. The conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty at the forthcoming partial test-ban Treaty amendment Conference next year should be encouraged to the full.The most remarkable event on our continent was the achievement of the independence of Namibia after years of relentless struggle. We extend to Namibia a warm and brotherly welcome. Another equally important landmark was the liberation of Nelson Mandela. His historic address from the rostrum  of this Hall displayed the conviction of his long and heroic struggle against the evils of apartheid.The situation in South Africa has remained precarious despite genuine progress towards a negotiated peaceful political settlement. It is our view that we should give cautious encouragement to further such progress until it becomes permanent and irreversible  leading to the total eradication of apartheid. There is therefore at the present time no occasion for undue haste for the relaxation of international pressure. Violence and the temptation to exploit internal divisions could easily jeopardise the chances of peace and stability. The agreement concluded in August between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South African Government represents the best hope for the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic and non-racial society in South Africa. All parties that are really committed to a peaceful solution should work towards the preparation of a new Constitution that will meet the hopes and aspirations of the people of South Africa as a whole. The emergence of a strong  united  multiracial and democratic South Africa will bring peace and stability to the region and contribute significantly to world economy.At a broader level  1989 and 1990 have witnessed events which have led to a fundamental restructuring of the world political system. Today  more than ever  the interdependence of nations is the basis for fruitful international relations. At both international and regional levels  this unique Organisation  which is the United Nations  is the right vehicle for collective action  especially in moments of crisis and distress.St has thus far mounted successful operations in Namibia and Central America. I am positive it could play a crucial role in resolving major regional conflicts  for example in Cambodia  whore certain encouraging developments have taken place at the Jakarta meeting.In the Middle East  we welcome the new dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue. We are more than ever convinced that an international peace conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  constitutes the only prospect for a comprehensive settlement recognising the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  and for enduring peace in the region. We also hope that meaningful dialogue and consultation in response to the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people will pave the way in the not too distant future for the peaceful unification of Korea.In this context my country will give favourable consideration to the admission of the Republic of Korea as a Member of the Organization without jeopardising the objective of unification and without excluding the simultaneous membership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.We should not lose sight of the relationship between disarmament and development. It is known that developing countries spend some $200 billion a year  representing some 20 per cent of their budget  on armaments. Admittedly  the security needs of States vary considerably according to geopolitical factors  but this expenditure still represents a staggering figure. It is a waste of resources when one considers that there is a negative outflow of some $50 billion a year from developing nations for debt servicing alone. Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue. The solution is as much a political as an economic one.Earlier this year  at its eighteenth special session  the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on International Economic Co-operation  in particular the Revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries  which we believe should provide the appropriate guidance for the drawing-up and adoption at the Assembly of an international development strategy in the context of the fourth development decade.As the world economy becomes more integrated  the international community needs a cohesive framework within which to address global economic issues. In this regard the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Paris is particularly important. He welcome the adoption of a new programme of action for debt relief and the other concrete measures taken to alleviate the economic plight of the least developed countries. The least developed countries require  in addition better opportunities for trade diversification and preferential access to markets and accrued capital Investments. That is the only way they can overcome severe structural problems  develop their human resources and achieve a sustainable rate of growth.The United Nations also hosted in June this year a meeting on island developing countries organised by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UHCTAD). Small island States belonging mostly to the category of least developed countries have intrinsic disabilities which severely contain their already limited range of development options in an unfavourable economic climate. This fact has unfortunately not been fully acknowledged yet. We must therefore pursue our efforts in this direction through closer exchanges and co-operation between various island groups  whose importance in different regions of the world have so far been under-estimated. I am aware that your country  Mr. President  has taken the initiative of organising another meeting of this kind for next year  and is playing an important role in improving contacts between small  island States hampered by remoteness and isolation.Free trade is the cornerstone of co-operation. For small  island nations which are economically interdependent and extremely vulnerable to external factors  the development of a more open  viable and durable multilateral trading system is essential. So too is a stable economic environment. The Uruguay Sound was launched to address serious concerns in this area. The general liberalisation of trade in recent years has been persistently undermined by protectionism and a weakening of regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Developing countries is particular have suffered from this kind of instability and lack of discipline in the trading system. Their efforts to implement the policy of trade and not aid are being thwarted by new forms of protectionism. Trade in sectors such as textiles  clothing  footwear and agriculture  where developing countries have a comparative advantage  have been particularly subject to discriminatory treatment. Such practices have impaired to a large extent the ability of developing countries to overcome their external-debt problems and promote their economic growth and development.The economies of the developing countries have further worsened in the wake of the Gulf crisis. To avoid a catastrophic situation  the international community needs to make special efforts to come to the assistance of developing countries adversely affected by spiralling oil prices. In this connection  we make a special appeal for a multilateral relief fund to be set up to help offset the additional economic problems being suffered by these countries. Another  equally vital series of negotiations will take place in 1992  during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We hope that the obstacles we encounter will be overcome. The Preparatory Committee of the Conference has already made extensive proposals to ensure fruitful discussions of a comprehensive agenda.There is a limit to the degree of ecological stress that our planet can endure. The irreversible damage inflicted every day on forests and in the atmosphere  the problem of marine pollution caused by excessive dumping of toxic industrial waste  and the overexploitation of fishery resources should help us draw the necessary lessons before it is too late. The success of the Conference in drawing up strategies to stop and reverse the effects of environmental degradation will require political will and sacrifice  but on this depends the fate of our only planet Earth.The United Nations has in recent years faced increasingly daunting challenges  we are confident that  with the emergence of this era of historic challenges and changes  our Organisation will continue to play an active role in achieving the objectives of our Charter."
"101",4935,"MWI",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Malawi delegation. I have much pleasure in congratulating you  Sir  on your election to preside over this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your qualifications and wide experience in international affairs have already been well stated by others who have preceded us. We are confident. therefore  that under your leadership and guidance the Assembly will achieve positive results in its work. In wishing you success  I also assure you of the Malawi delegation's utmost co-operation as you carry out the enormous tasks and responsibilities entrusted to you.My delegation equally congratulates your predecessor  Mr. Joseph V. Garba of Nigeria. The past 12 months presented the General Assembly with a very busy schedule  which  apart from the many resumed sittings of the forty-fourth regular session itself  also included three very important special sessions. Mr. Garba presided over the work of all those sessions with efficiency and effectiveness. As we congratulate him on a job well done  we also wish him all the very best for the future.On behalf of the Malawi delegation  I am happy to applaud our esteemed Secretary-General. Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his steady stewardship of our Organisation as it has continued its work of promoting international peace and security  understanding and co-operation. We also pay tribute to all his staff for their outstanding dedication to duty  at times even in the face of extremely difficult personal and professional circumstances. We hope that they can find satisfaction  pride and renewal in seeing their assignments  particularly the difficult ones  come to a successful and beneficial conclusion. We note that one such was the year-long assignment undertaken between April 1989 and March 1990 by the men and women who comprised the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)  which helped Namibia through this final and most difficult process of transformation from an illegally controlled colony to a proud new sovereign State.Before going any further  I should like  on behalf of the people and Government of Malawi  warmly to welcome Liechtenstein  the newest Member of our Organisation. As already noted by others  Liechtenstein's admission moves us a step closer to full realisation of the universality of the United Nations.My delegation notes from the Secretary-General's report to the Assembly that until the advent of the grave developments in the Persian Gulf on 2 August  the international situation had been characterized by general peace and tranquillity. Significantly  in certain regions where strife and conflict had hitherto come to be almost regarded as the norm peace and calm had returned at last.We note with interest also some of the other momentous and historic developments that have occurred during this period. In Africa  for instance  the last chapter of European colonialism finally closed. Meanwhile  in Eastern Europe we witnessed the once formidable Iron Curtain brought crashing down as the order which had been established behind it after the Second World War was swept away in a political earthquake whose aftershock continues to be felt in far-away places. However  my delegation has further observed that  although there has been considerable positive development in the political sphere  natters have not been quite the same in other areas. Thus  for instance  despite the apparently wide focus given to economic problems  especially those affecting developing countries  very limited concrete achievements can be identified. Ironically  some of the very developments in the political sphere that have rightly been welcomed have themselves appeared further to compound some of the existing economic problems.In view of the many issues and problems  some new and some perennial  set out by the Secretary-General in his report  and reflected in the Assembly's agenda  it is the sincere hope of the Malawi delegation that this session will strive for practical results.We in Malawi are most encouraged by the further positive progress that has been achieved in eliminating or reducing the areas of tension around the world and has thus increased the prospects of wider international peace and stability.In this connection  we note with pleasure  for instance  that  following the successful start in the implementation of the Arias Plan  adopted in 1987 as a means for bringing about an end to the regional conflicts in Central America  peace has been returned to that area. We have no doubt that the Plan will be successfully implemented in all the affected parts of the region.The ending of years of war will not result overnight in the elimination of all the problems that confront the countries concerned. However  peace will make it possible for them to harness more of their national energies and resources  both human and material  towards social and economic development.We have followed with keen interest developments in the Far East  and have been encouraged by the continuing dialogue between North and South Korea on ways to reunite their divided motherland. We have been particularly encouraged that for the first time there has been direct contact at the high level of Prime Ministers. We in Malawi support and encourage these endeavours  which can only contribute towards a positive outcome.As regards the Cambodian question  we are greatly encouraged by the considerable progress that has been achieved under the aegis of the five permanent members of the Security Council in the search for a viable solution. We welcome the establishment of the Supreme National Council. Needless to say  developments have now reached a critical and delicate stage. We would therefore urge all those with central roles to play to avoid precipitate decisions and actions that might jeopardise further progress. My Government has taken note of the Secretary-General's continued efforts in the quest for a solution to the question of Cyprus. We have similarly followed his efforts to implement agreements already reached on the problems of Afghanistan and Western Sahara. Permit me to reiterate Malawi's support for all these dialogues and endeavours.Since last October a major political revolution has swept through Eastern Europe. As a result  the Socialist order established in the region after the Second World War has for the most part been replaced by a new one based on the respective peoples' democratic aspirations. Malawi hopes that the peoples of Eastern Europe will be able finally to achieve the political  social and economic objectives to which they aspire.Among the major results of the Eastern European revolution has been to facilitate the reunification of the two Germanys  which takes effect in a few hours. I take this opportunity  on behalf of the people of Malawi  to congratulate the German people as they become a single nation again. We wish them well for the future. My delegation expresses Malawi's belief that a reunified Germany will be a positive force in promoting international unity  understanding and co-operation.It is particularly comforting to be able for once to talk about our own region  southern Africa  with some justified optimism. In this connection perhaps the most important development in the region has been the accession of Namibia to independence on 21 March of this year. I would therefore  on behalf of the Malawi delegation and the Malawi Government  extend once again to the Government and the people of Namibia our warm congratulations.However  not all the political problems that have hitherto confronted southern Africa have now been evolved. For  with the exception of the question of Namibia  moat of the issues on the southern Africa agenda remain unresolved. The insurgencies in Angola and Mozambique continue unabated  while apartheid with all its adverse implications remains in place in the Republic of South Africa.With regard to Angola  we regret the apparent failure of the much-heralded agreement reached at Gbadolite  Zaire  in Jun· 1989  to bring about a settlement of the 2.4-year-old Insurgency carried out against the Government of that country by the bandits of the Union for the Total independence of Angola (UNITA). Indeed  we are concerned at the apparent escalation and widening of hostilities between the forces of the two sides in recent times. In the circumstance  therefore  we are encouraged by the recent reaffirmation by the Government of Angola of its commitment to seeking a peaceful solution. We in Malawi support the Angolan Government's efforts and we appeal to those external forces that would seek to fish in the perceived muddy waters in Angola to weigh carefully the grave consequences of their actions  not only for Angola and the Angolan people but for the whole southern African region.When he addressed the Assembly in October last year the leader of the Malawi delegation applauded what he described as the courageous step taken by the leader of Mozambique  His Excellency President Joaquim Chissano  in inviting the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) to enter unconditionally into negotiations with his Government so as to bring about an end to the conflict that has ravaged that country during the past 16 years.We note that since then the Mozambique Government has pursued every avenue towards establishing a dialogue with SEMAMO. We in Malawi were therefore pleased to learn recently that following the direct contacts by representatives of the two sides they had agreed to hold further meetings. And we have been even more pleased and encouraged to hear that the Central Committee of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) decided last July to open up the political process in the country to all  so that even SERANO would be free to participate in national life. My government believes that this FBSLZMO decision and the other policies introduced by the Mozambique government during the past two years have already net most  if not all  of the conditions previously demanded by RENAMO before it could end its insurgency. We therefore hope very sincerely that RENAMO will seize this opportunity to demonstrate its patriotism and that  together with the Government  it will help to Leal the national wounds and create in Mozambique the necessary conditions whereby all Mozambicans can work together for the social and economic development of their beautiful country.Following the changes in Namibia  we have welcomed developments in the Republic of South Africa. We have been encouraged by the practical signs of the South African Government's apparent determination to fulfil its undertaking to end the present universally condemned system of apartheid. as manifested by  among other things  the unbanning of political groups and the release of political prisoners  especially Mr. Nelson Mandela  Deputy President of the African National Congress (AHC). We very much welcome the release of Mr. Mandela.None of these measures taken thus far by the South African Government can in any way be construed of themselves as constituting the dismantling of apartheid. Indeed  it could well be said that they do not meet the conditions set by the international community  including the General Assembly  for the relaxation of pressure on South Africa and for its readmission as a bona fide member of the community of nations. Nevertheless  it is our view that the steps taken thus far  limited though some of them maybe  constitute significant progress. We believe that the initiation  at last  of the dialogue now taking place between the South African Government and the leaders of the ANC was in large part facilitated by these very measures Meanwhile  the dialogue itself has already contributed towards creating the conditions in which the process of realising all the political  social and economic goals set by the majority in that country and supported by the international community could begin. In our view the issue ought not to be whether there should be returns to one side or to the other for actions and measures taken towards bringing about this positive change in South Africa. Rather  we believe that it is more important - and it would certainly be  ore helpful - for the international community to acknowledge these positive developments sad encourage further steps so as to help accelerate the solution of that country's political problems. In that way  we believe  will real progress be achieved. For  as the saying goes  even a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.My Government supports the dialogue now going on in South Africa and we are encouraged by the progress achieved so far. We are therefore greatly concerned about the likely adverse effect that certain recant developments  especially the escalation in factional violence  could have on the future of the process now set in train towards the holding of constitutional negotiations.Meanwhile  my delegation wishes to express Malawi's pleasure at the dramatic change in the atmosphere that has taken place in southern Africa since South Africa embarked on the path to peaceful change. For the first time in decades the subregion has enjoyed relative peace and tranquillity. We welcome this and look forward to the restoration of permanent peace and security in the subregion. This would enable all States in southern Africa to direct all their energies and national resources towards the social and economic development of their respective peoples. I wish to express my delegation's extreme concern over the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East. In the past 12 months we have witnessed an apparent abandonment of the search for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian question. We have also seen hopes for a return to peace in the Persian Gulf dashed as that area has been plunged into a fresh conflict with serious implications for international peace and security  on the one hand  and for international economic stability and development  on the other.With regard to the Palestinian question  Malawi deeply regrets the termination of the dialogue between the United States end the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). We also regret the abandonment by the Israeli Government of its own widely supported plan for initiating a political dialogue between itself and the Palestinians in the occupied territories as £ prelude to constitutional negotiations. In our view that return to the status quo ante of ""no war  no peace"" is not the way to make progress. It will only make the search for a peaceful solution even more difficult. Indeed  we have already noted with dismay the resurgence of wanton violence since the cessation of all dialogue.We therefore wish to call upon all the parties to the Palestinian question to reconsider their positions and to give peace another chance. Peace can be achieved through the resumption of dialogue  either bilaterally or multilaterally  in the context of an international conference in which all the parties would participate equally and without preconditions.As for the situation in the Persian Gulf  my Government deeply regrets the invasion of Kuwait and the forcible removal of its Government. Malawi opposes as a matter of principle the use or threat of use of force by one State against another. We oppose even more strongly the menacing of a smaller State by a bigger one  as in the present instance  for the purpose of compelling the smaller State to bow to the letter's will. Such actions threaten international peace and security and must not be condoned.In our view  Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait  apart from threatening peace and security in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East in general  also pose  through their adverse effects on fossil-oil prices  a threat to international economic stability and development  especially for developing countries.Accordingly  Malawi supports the role played by the United Nations  through the Security Council  and also supports the regional efforts by Arab States in seeking to resolve this crisis through an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait.Despite the continued existence of areas of conflict and tension  we remain confident that  given the growing co-operation between the super-Powers  the prospects for wider international peace and security are better now than ever before. Thus  the co-ordinated response and subsequent joint initiatives taken by the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics over the Kuwait crisis are a hopeful portent for future global security.In the mean time we have seen how  as a result of increased bilateral United States-USSR understanding and co-operation  East-West tension has virtually disappeared. Indeed  earlier this year the cold war  which had shaped international relations since the Second World War  was declared to be over. We note that since then the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the countries of the Warsaw Pact have embarked upon a search for ways in which the two former rival organisations can now forge co-operation between them.In view of those circumstances  it is Malawi's hope that we shall at least see more positive progress in other areas of security  particularly in arms reduction and disarmament. We thus welcome the Secretary-General's report  which indicates that there has been some progress in SOME of the work of the Disarmament Commission. We further note that progress has also been achieved in bilateral negotiations on arms reduction between the United States and the Soviet Union. In this contest  I should like to express Malawi's satisfaction at the agreements reached earlier this year which make possible the start of mutual reductions in NATO and Warsaw Pact armed forces stationed in Europe. We consider that to be a major achievement.Meanwhile we have paid attention to the outcome of the Fourth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons held at Geneva last month  and we look forward to the Amending Conference on the partial test-ban Treaty. We believe that the time is now right for that Treaty to be expanded into a complete and comprehensive one. At a time when the world is said to have gone beyond the cold war and is instead embracing understanding and co-operation  we can see no further need for the testing  let alone production  of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. We therefore hope that the Amending Conference to be held in January 1991 will be able to take the correct decision on this question.Malawi hopes that with both disarmament among the major Powers and arms reduction among the other countries now becoming a reality  it will be possible to examine again  with a view to possible implementation  the recommendations contained in the Final Document prepared for the special session on disarmament held at New York in 1988  which the Assembly failed to adopt. Notwithstanding the argument then adduced against assuming the existence of an automatic correlation between disarmament and development  we are inclined to believe that the now widely touted idea of a peace dividend does in fact confirm the validity of such an assumption. Therefore we would also urge the weapon-possessing states  as they begin to look seriously at disarmament and examine alternative areas for the deployment of the resources previously spent on the armed forces and armaments industries  to consider that it could be equally to their economic advantage if the alternative industries could help promote economic development in the developing countries. We believe that that proposal is worth serious considerations.My government has been encouraged by the apparent increased attention paid during the past 12 months to international economic co-operation and especially to bow to address the problem of the developing countries. We note that in addition to being part of the agenda of the yearly summit meetings of the industrialised countries  the problems of developing countries have also been the subject of at least two United Nations-sponsored meetings  namely  the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  held in April  and the second United Nations Conference on Least developed Countries  held last month.  With regard to the eighteenth special session  however  we  as a least developed country  were rather disappointed that the session chose not to consider the problems confronting such countries. Even though those were already scheduled to be considered later at a Conference especially devoted to the problem of least developed countries  we believe that it would have been most appropriate and beneficial to have had them examined in a more global context as well  so that their solutions could also be part of a comprehensive plea of action. For  although unique in some ways  the problem of the least developed countries are no different from those of other countries. They stem from the sane root and have the same consequences  only in a more concerted form. My Government was  of course  pleased that the special session was able to accept some of the proposals long advanced by the developing countries as means to resolving their economic plight. Among these was the need to make loans from international financial institutions  for example  the World Bank  amenable to rescheduling; another was the need to recognise that the development of social infrastructures  such as hospitals and schools  is equally essential to national economic development and therefore eligible for financing with loans granted at concessionary rates.However  we were disappointed that the developed countries once again resisted proposals aimed at addressing directly the debt crisis  the existing trade imbalances and barriers  low commodity prices and the need for substantial transfers of technology to developing countries. Instead  they insisted again on prescribing formulas that have already proved either inappropriate or ineffective  while at the same time introducing new conditions for granting aid. In our view  some of these conditions would seem to encourage and justify interference in a recipient country's internal affairs. Unfortunately  these conditions have since also received endorsement at other meetings of developed donor countries.Malawi supports the growing international concern about seeking solutions to the various social problems confronting the international community. We especially applaud the leading role that the United Nations has taken on several of these  for example in the fight against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic and the scourge of international drug trafficking  as well as in promoting the welfare of children. As regards the latter  we have just seen for ourselves the UNICCF-sponsored World Summit for Children  held here last weekend which is said to have been attended by the largest gathering of Heads of State in history. Regrettably  the countries most affected by these problems are those whose need to survive economically often leads them to ignore or otherwise accommodate the unacceptable situations which these problems create. We  therefore  regard as cynical and most unfortunate the suggestions made by some developed countries that the affected developing countries should bear greater responsibility for solving such problems as that of illicit narcotic drug production and trafficking. We would suggest  instead  that if the developed countries did more to facilitate more rapid development in the developing countries  the present problems might not exist at all  or they would have been easier either to eliminate or to contain.It is for these and other reasons that Malawi would appeal for a more objective and pragmatic consideration of how best to promote meaningful and mutually beneficial North-South co-operation. The North has to help bring about a more rapid developed South. We remain convinced that an economically stable and healthy South is in the economic interest of the north; the world cannot achieve real security and stability as long as a large section of it remains economically  socially and politically unstable and insecure.My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express  on behalf of the Government of Malawi  its appreciation for the assistance which it has continued to receive from the international donor community  especially from the United Nations and its various agencies. This has enabled it to deal with some of the consequences of the political insecurity and instability confronting our subregion. There are signs at last which would suggest that the causes of the existing situation could finally be eliminated. Until then  we shall continue to need external assistance in coping with those problems  such as the influx of refugees  whose number increases every day. We are also grateful to the United Nations  as well as to other donors  for their continued support for our national development effort. We value this assistance very much.In closing  allow me to wish the Assembly success in its deliberations. The delegation of Malawi looks forward to making its own modest contribution to this goal."
"102",4981,"MYS",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  it is fitting that I begin my address before the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session by extending my congratulations to you. Your election reflects our full confidence that you will  given your wisdom  experience and skill  successfully discharge your responsibilities for guiding the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion. Your predecessor   His Excellency Major-General Joseph Garba  carried out his task with dedication and I express my appreciation to him for a job well done. I must here underline too how impressed Malaysia has been by the indefatigable efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in the pursuit of peace and stability.I offer words of welcome and congratulations to the delegation of Namibia  participating for the first time in a regular session of the General Assembly  and to the delegation of Liechtenstein  the latest addition to the membership of the United Nations. I also welcome the delegation of Yemen  now united under a single banner. I should like to welcome in advance the United German delegation  in anticipation of the official reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990. The entry of new States into the United Nations fold will further enhance the universal attributes of this world body. In this regard Malaysia would support a request by the Republic of Korea to become a Member of the United Nations. Such a step would  1 in our assessment  also contribute to further rapprochement between the two Koreas.We are witnessing important changes taking place in many parts of the world  changes which inevitably affect the state of international relations  offering both ' challenges and opportunities. Changes taking place in the Soviet Union  attributable largely to the policies of President Gorbachev himself  have created a climate of confidence that has brought an end to the cold war which had for decades divided the world into camps and alignments. The growing rapprochement between the two super-Powers and the changing international scenario provide us with hope for a new world order where the mistrust and rivalry of yester-year will give way to co-operation  consultation and peaceful coexistence between States.A pertinent question which concerns us is how these changes will affect the workings of the United Nations and its role in the interactions between and among States. I would say: to a very important extent. Nevertheless  the United Nations remains the organization that can provide the best forum and vehicle for building international consensus and promoting international co-operation through its various organs  in particular the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. In the past  rivalry between the super-Powers has caused the Security Council to be deadlocked over many issues and prevented the Council from taking necessary action because of the use of the veto. However  we are now witnessing a mutuality of interests and a common will to resolve international crises made possible by the changing international scenario and the recognition of the centrality of the role of the United Nations. The debate on the invasion of Kuwait is testimony to the political will now prevailing to seek united action on issues brought before the Council. Malaysia would like to believe that the world is now moving into an era where the principle of collective security  albeit embryonic  is put into practice  fulfilling the vision of the founding fathers of the United Nations.Malaysia is proud to be part of the evolution taking place in the United Nations  in particular in the Security Council. We have always stood for the effective discharge of the Council's conciliatory and mandatory powers to ensure universal compliance with and implementation of its decisions. Malaysia also believes that a rationalization of the function and mandate of the Security Council should be carried out in the spirit of a dynamic and constantly evolving United Nations  to enable the Council to address all issues at hand more effectively.There is now a large measure of understanding among the five permanent members of the Security Council on a number of issues and this  if sustained  should augur well for the future work of the Council and the United Nations as a whole. But this understanding should not lead to exclusivity in decision-making. The five must be responsible in their actions not only to themselves but also to the rest of the international community. They should not use their veto power to impede consensus or prevent action. Their work should serve the interests of all Member States and not just the interests of certain States or groups of States only. While the Gulf crisis and the question of Cambodia have demonstrated lately a unity of purpose among the permanent five  this unity must also provide evidence of their willingness to work closely together on other problems that have eluded solution all this while  in particular the question of Palestine.The renewed faith in democracy  as borne out by the political and social upheavals in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world will to a significant extent  also have an impact on voting behaviour at the United Nations. If during the cold war votes were cast according to the political alignments of Member States  we now should be able to witness in the Assembly a significant decline in such voting behaviour. We hope that the decline of bloc voting will lead to the achievement of more decisions by consensus on many issues. This will certainly facilitate the achievement of more realistic solutions to many global problems. In order for the"" United Nations to function with greater responsibilities  it must have the necessary financial resources  both through the timely and unconditional payment of assessed contributions by Member States and through substantial voluntary contributions by States to assist in particular projects or activities. It is evident that the peace-keeping function of the United Nations and  hence  the corollary financial burden of its peace-keeping operations have increased considerably. This is one area which needs the close attention of Member States.The agenda of this session of the General Assembly in itself provides an impressive list of important issues. Regional conflicts remain a question of great concern. Malaysia hopes that these conflicts can be resolved peacefully with the appropriate involvement of the United Nations  as was the case in Namibia and Nicaragua. We would support further efforts by the Secretary-General and the countries in Central America to effect a peaceful settlement of other problems facing the region. Malaysia also feels encouraged that the Secretary-General has been able to begin the process of implementing a settlement plan in Western Sahara. Malaysia notes that serious efforts have been undertaken to find a durable solution to the question of Afghanistan. Malaysia welcomes the agreement between Iraq and Iran to implement fully Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and bring their costly war to a peaceful end. Nevertheless  we remain perturbed that tension continues elsewhere in the region.The end of the cold war should pave the way for the solution of many of the important problems still on the agenda of the United Nations. Of these  the Palestinian problem is perhaps the most crucial. While the world continues to laud the triumph of democracy in Eastern Europe and elsewhere  it cannot remain incongruously silent on the democratic rights of the Palestinian people  people who have remained the victims of Israel's policies of aggression  intimidation and  oppression and who have been denied their rights to self-determination and a homeland. If we are indeed on the brink of the era of collective security in international relations  then  pray  let us see this spirit of collectivism extend to the solution of the Palestinian problem as well. Otherwise  it would be difficult for us to claim that the practice of double standards does not exist among the key Members of the United Nations. For Malaysia  it is unacceptable that the Security Council could pronounce itself so forcefully on the Gulf crisis when it has not been able to act on the critical issue of Palestine.Apartheid is another long-standing problem  but there still appears to be hope for a solution. The release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other anti-apartheid groups  the partial lifting of the state of emergency  and the renunciation of the armed struggle by the ANC have been important developments in creating a climate conducive for negotiations. The dialogue that has been initiated between Nelson Mandela  as representative of the black majority in South Africa  and President De Klerk must continue to its logical conclusion  that is  the attainment of a one-man one-vote system in a free  democratic and non-racial South Africa and the end of apartheid. Until this objective is achieved  the international community should continue to maintain both pressure and sanctions on the South African regime. We are concerned  however  at the recent upsurge in violence between the blacks  in which inter-factional rivalry has led to the deaths of many. We are now heartened by the latest indications that Nelson Mandela and Chief Buthelezi will meet; this augurs well for black solidarity and will  we hope  prevent further bloodshed. We would urge President De Klerk  who is responsible for the maintenance of law and order in South Africa  to take appropriate actions  including actions to deal with questions relating to police partisanship and white-extremist involvement. In South-East Asia  the Cambodian conflict will  we hope  come to a peaceful end soon. The recent agreement in Jakarta of all the Cambodian parties to accept the framework document of the permanent five as a basis for a comprehensive political settlement and the formation of the Supreme National Council is a promising start to the process of achieving a just and durable peaceful solution. The adoption of Security Council resolution 668 (1990)  in which Malaysia fully participated  should provide further impetus to the efforts to speed up this process. The Cambodians themselves must now resolve their remaining differences  and it is also for them to demonstrate greater flexibility in the drawing up of a comprehensive political settlement. This will make possible the early reconvening of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia  where a peace agreement on the protracted conflict can be signed and sealed. As a member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which has long involved itself in seeking a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem  Malaysia welcomes the progress made thus far and stands ready to welcome the decision of the Cambodian people in regard to their own future  through free and fair elections organized and conducted by the United Nations.Against the backdrop of rapprochement between the two super-Powers and a definite trend towards a reduction in regional tensions  the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August came as a major shock  underlining the fragility and volatility of our international system. Malaysia was distressed by the resort to armed intervention by one Muslim brother against another  both of whom Malaysia values in friendship. This consideration notwithstanding  Malaysia stood firmly by the principles which we strongly believe in and acted accordingly as a Security Council member to support all Council resolutions pertaining to the invasion  a violation of international law which we could never condone. In seeking a peaceful and early solution to the crisis  we have maintained that the United Nations should play a central role and that  at the same time  all resolutions adopted by the Security Council should be effectively implemented. Malaysia has insisted in the Council that diplomatic and political efforts be continuously exerted to bring an end to the crisis.The Middle East remains the world's most volatile region. It is clear that a major event occurring in the region will have strong political  economic and religious consequences around the world. For obvious reasons  it needs our full attention. The recent turn of events in the Gulf is bringing the region  and the world  close to the precipice of war. The build-up of forces in the region is certainly a cause for deep concern. As a matter of principle and being a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Malaysia is averse to military forces of major Powers being transplanted into other regions. We must exert every effort to avoid a dangerous development that could spark off a full-scale war  with its unwelcome Consequences to the region and the world at large. The international economic situation continues to remain a matter of great concern to all of us  particularly the developing countries. Many of these continue to experience slow economic growth  in some cases negative growth  in addition to problems of external indebtedness  depressed commodity prices  market access and a host of other problems. Earlier this year  at the special session on international economic co-operation  we agreed to undertake concrete measures to promote the economic growth and development of developing countries. This commitment must now be translated into constructive action. The recently concluded conference pertaining to less developed countries is a welcome step towards alleviating the plight of these particular countries.The problems of the developing countries have to be placed in proper perspective. It is with this in mind that 15 of the developing countries got together in Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  in early June this year. These countries do not claim to be the self-appointed arbiters and regulators of world economic affairs. Neither did they sit down to conspire against anyone - in the North or in the South. Their aims were not ambitious. They came together to take a realistic approach to problems and to explore the potential for wider and more intensive South-South co-operation. Malaysia hopes that a forum such as the meeting of that group of 15  with the support of other developing countries  can help to facilitate dialogue  not only among countries in the South but also between the South and the North. We believe that an organized South would contribute to the promotion of just and viable solutions to the South's varied economic problems.The developing countries recognize that there have to be ways and means to find solutions to the problems faced by them. There are various forums for this purpose. The United Nations is certainly one of them. This Organization should be encouraged to address international economic issues with a view to contributing towards finding the right solutions. The Group of 77 remains an important forum for dialogue among the developing countries and a conduit for dialogue between them and the developed countries at the United Nations and in other forums.It must be realized that in this post-cold-war era  new arrangements for a more stable international economic and trading system have to be found. The North cannot totally neglect the problems and needs of many countries in the South simply because there are newly emerging democracies in the North that require help. The countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America have an equal stake in the future of the world economy. Their needs are equally urgent  if not more urgent  than those of countries in Eastern Europe. They must not be ignored. Let us give the United Nations system the opportunity to build a consensus on these pressing questions.All of us are in full agreement that environmental degradation must cease. We are all committed to a clean and environmentally safe world not only for us and our generation but for those who come after. It is this fundamental commitment that has enabled the United Nations and its agencies  particularly the United Nations Environment Programme  to play a leadership role in addressing environmental issues which threaten man's life-support systems. The active involvement of the United Nations is reflected in its various resolutions and activities  in particular the forthcoming 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We wish to recall and to state that for the 1992 Conference to succeed we must all dedicate our efforts to ensure the following: first  the effective transfer of environmentally sound and appropriate technology to developing countries; secondly   the provision of new and additional financial resources to enable developing countries to play their role; and  thirdly  a supportive international economic environment which promotes economic growth and development  particularly that of developing countries. Highlighting environmental issues without a linkage to development would not serve any of our interests. Similarly  neither legal instruments nor unilateral measures  including bans and distorted campaigns  will contribute to our cause of a clean and safe world. Environment and development are mutually reinforcing and interrelated.The issue of the protection of the global environment cannot be separated from the question of Antarctica. There should be a truly global environmental convention for the conservation and protection of Antarctica to benefit mankind. Antarctica presents the best opportunity for the international community to embark upon a comprehensive multilateral effort to secure a safe and clean environment for future generations. We should all support efforts to ban prospecting and mining in and around Antarctica and to ensure that all activities will be used exclusively for peaceful scientific research. Malaysia supports the idea of preserving Antarctica as a nature reserve or world park. All of us should be able to find common ground  through the United Nations  between those that are parties to the Antarctic Treaty system and those that are not. We cannot afford to lose that continent to our own narrow and selfish interests.Drug abuse and illicit trafficking is another very important issue which requires the appropriate response of the international community since it affects all countries. Member States agreed at the seventeenth special session  on drugs  last February that the United Nations should be provided with the necessary mandate and resources to increase international co-operation to combat the drug problem. Let us make that a reality. This problem is far too important for us to expect the United Nations to carry out its tasks in this field without its capability being strengthened. We should all support any proposal that can make the United Nations more efficient and effective in this area  including a restructuring of the relevant United Nations bodies into a single entity. The drug problem has assumed  a very complex character  requiring responses at all levels. Hence  international action should be co-ordinated through the United Nations  while Governments do their part in coping with the problem domestically. Malaysia for one has gone to great lengths to combat drug abuse in the country.The 1990s should be a decade of renewed faith in the United Nations. We have witnessed significant developments recently which will have a lasting impact on the future of the United Nations system as a whole. In the entire history of the United Nations never has the time been so propitious for it to regain the confidence and trust of the international community as it is now. With renewed faith from all Members alike  the United Nations can play its rightful role in helping to reshape this post-cold-war world. The United Nations needs our full support. "
"103",5008,"NAM",45,1990,"﻿it gives me great pleasure to address the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. At the outset  let me extend my heartfelt congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your unanimous election and wish you well in the heavy responsibilities entrusted to you. Your vast experience and diplomatic skill assure us that the work of the Assembly is in good hands.I should like to express my personal happiness and sense of pride to your predecessor  General Joseph Garba  for the efficiency and wisdom with which he steered the forty-fourth session to a successful conclusion. We truly deserves praise by Africa and the world at large for a job well done.The United Nations family was recently reinforced by a new Member  the Principality of Liechtenstein  whose membership my Government warmly welcomes. If I may say so  I had been looking forward to addressing the Assembly as President of the newest Member State of the United Nations. However  the Principality of Liechtenstein overtook us before the finish line. Therefore  as the second youngest Member  we take special pride in welcoming Liechtenstein and expressing confidence that it will enrich us all. The year 1990 has special meaning to the Namibian people. It is the year of the independence of the Republic of Namibia and  indeed  a momentous year for our country and our people as well as for the United Nations. The Namibian question has been a burning issue on the agenda of the General Assembly for decades as well as the subject-matter of many Assembly and Security Council resolutions and numerous international conferences. It was the overwhelming desire for freedom burning in the souls of the Namibian people to free themselves from the yoke of apartheid colonialism that led tens of thousands of our fine young men and women to sacrifice their lives for the freedom of their motherland. Many more were imprisoned  tortured  injured and maimed in the process.That sad chapter has now come to an end and we have opened a new chapter in our history. We now tackle the process of nation-building towards consolidating our hard-won freedom and opening the way to a bright future for all Namibians. We are determined to face the challenges in the fields of agriculture  rural development  education  health care  job creation and human-resources development. Full of hope  optimism and determination  we now dedicate ourselves to the arduous task of the socio-economic reconstruction and development of our country for the benefit of all our people. In this endeavour we are resolute in our desire to build stability and peace for our nation on the solid foundations of our fledgling democracy and the rule of law enshrined in our Constitution.We are deeply conscious of the fact that this formidable undertaking will require hard work and political wisdom. But we are determined to march forward  inspired by the unity of our people and the need to achieve social justice for all. During the brief period since our independence  we have already been able to ensure peace within our borders  create confidence about the future among all Namibians  and set an agenda for national reconstruction. All of this we have been able to do in spite of the recent past in Namibia  characterized by racial conflict and war.Our young democracy and multi-party system are steadily moving forward and giving our people hope that the political monsters of the past are gone for good. It gives me special pride to inform this body that my delegation consists of members of most of the political parties represented in our Parliament.We  in Namibia  are blessed with a very beautiful climate  a large sparsely populated country with quite unique scenic landscapes. We have an environmental paradise which  by our Constitution  we are duty bound to preserve and treasure. Many of you here and many officials and citizens of your countries who visited Namibia during this last year can attest to this and many have in fact already done so by returning as tourists to enjoy all that our country has to offer.We are heartened by the fact that the international community has given our Government a firm vote of confidence for the efforts that we are making in promoting the basic and fundamental human rights of our people  political stability and pragmatic economic policies. The struggle which we have embarked upon and which we are determined to win is that of national reconstruction and economic development. In this connection we are confident that the plans we have drawn up to create an atmosphere conducive to foreign investment and to stimulate the recovery of our economy are sound.At this moment  foreign companies are actively looking at existing or potential opportunities to do business with us. We have already signed agreements with a number of foreign and international institutions aiming at promoting private investment. Following the successful donors' pledging conference held here in New York earlier this year  my Government is planning to convene a private sector investment conference to allow local and foreign private investors to acquaint themselves with our development efforts and to explore the possibilities for joint ventures.Being conscious of the interdependence of the regional economies  my Government joined the Southern Africa Development Co-ordinating Conference immediately after independence. In so doing we hope to make our contribution to the strengthening of the economies of the region by promoting trade  communication and co-operation among ourselves with the aim of strengthening the industrial networks in the region.Like most Asian  African and Caribbean developing countries  Namibia is seeking membership of the Lomé Convention with the hope of securing beneficial access to the European markets for our agricultural products  especially our high quality beef. Our country's low level of development and highly lopsided economy make us one of the poorest countries in the world. For this reason  we are also seeking to be granted a least developed country status. We are pleased to note in this regard the positive decision of the recent least-developed-countries Conference held in Paris  which has recommended to the current session of the General Assembly that Namibia be granted such a status I am confident that my Government can count on the assistance of the Member States to support that recommendation.We are greatly indebted to the United Nations for the constructive assistance rendered to Namibia and its people in laying a healthy foundation for the realisation of the well-being of our people. This truly collective effort the countries of the world represents an outstanding achievement. This victory made it possible to achieve one of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations  namely  the right to self-determination and national independence.On behalf of my Government and our people  I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to the United Nations Secretary-General for pursuing with great skill and determination the pledge he made on taking office when he committed himself to the earliest implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978).I wish to offer our profound thanks to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council for the dedicated work done over the years in support of the just struggle of the people of Namibia. In this contest  I should like to single out the men and women who served in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) under the able leadership of Mr. Ahtisaari of Finland  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  and his deputy. Ambassador Joe Legwaila of Botswana  for their commitment and dedication in successfully accomplishing that historic and unprecedented mission.At this juncture I wish to pay a special tribute to the members of the recently dissolved United Nations Council for Namibia for their tenacity in pursuing the mandate entrusted to them by the United Nations. The United Nations was able to sustain its responsibility over Namibia until the day of its independence largely because of the ardour and selfless dedication of the Council. Yes  indeed  the Council was truly a partner in the struggle for Namibia's freedom and independence.I appeal to the General Assembly to ensure the successful completion of the remaining programmes of support for the Namibian people  including  in particular  the smooth transfer of the United Nations Institute for Namibia.I recall from the recent resolution adopted by the General Assembly on the occasion of the dissolution of the United Nations Council for Namibia that the United Nations Secretary-General himself will be the custodian of the United Nations Fund for Namibia with a view to ensuring the completion of ongoing programmes and activities currently financed from United Nations sources.In this connection  the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General  in recognition of the unique and direct responsibility that the United Nations had assumed over Namibia prior to independence  to ensure the continued role of the United Nations in the reconstruction and development of the newly independent State of Namibia by providing the necessary resources and staff within the Secretariat for the delivery of such programmes of assistance. Accordingly  I appeal to the Assembly and the international community as a whole to sustain the role of the Secretary-General in this regard by providing adequate funds for the successful completion of all the programmes.I should like to reaffirm once again before this august body our eternal gratitude to the front-line States  the Organization of African Unity and the Movement of Mon-Aligned Countries for the political  moral and material support they rendered during the darkest and most difficult days of our struggle for independence. Similarly we express our appreciation to Governments and peoples the world over who generously supported our just cause and whose collective efforts made Namibia's independence a reality.On behalf of the Government and people of Namibia  I thank those nations for their political  material and technical contributions to the successful implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1976).The good will demonstrated towards our country and its people was reflected again in the generosity of many Member States which pledged assistance for Namibia's development at the donors' pledging Conference held earlier this year here in New York. On behalf of my Government and people I wish once again to thank all those countries for their practical demonstration of support for our efforts to make a success of Namibia's independence.The success story resulting from the global co-operative effort in Namibia has left us with a sense of profound hope for the world and its future and the crucial peace-keeping and conflict-resolution roles of the United Nations. Through the Namibian experience  the United Nations has demonstrated that when there is the necessary political will  unity of purpose and international determination and solidarity  solutions can be found to the most vexed problems facing mankind. We should not lose sight of this lesson when we seek solutions to the remaining challenges of our time. As is to be expected of a concerned neighbour  I fervently and sincerely wish that such a spirit will also guide the international community in finding a durable solution to the problem of the inhuman system of apartheid in South Africa. Recent developments such as the release of some political prisoners  including Nelson Mandela  the unbanning of political organisations  the suspension of the armed liberation struggle by the African National Congress and the initiation of talks between the South African Government and the African National Congress represent moves in the right direction towards the peaceful resolution of that conflict.However  we cannot ignore the fact that the principal pillars of apartheid are still intact. Neither can we ignore the fact that the majority of the oppressed people of South Africa are still deprived of exercising their democratic right to vote. Furthermore  the much-publicized talks about talks have yet to reach the stage of serious  purposeful and substantive negotiations aimed at finding a democratic and non-racial constitutional transformation in South Africa. Moreover  we are deeply saddened by the recent spate of violence and the resulting loss of life and destruction of property. These unfortunate developments  if not controlled  are likely to derail the promising efforts currently under way towards finding a peaceful solution.In this connection my Government joins the entire international community in calling upon all the participants in the process to practise restraint and extreme caution. We should like to reaffirm that it is  in the first instance  the responsibility of President De Klerk's Government to arrest the violence and to put an end to it. Given the prevailing situation in South Africa  it is the strong view of my Government that the decisions and recommendations adopted by the General Assembly at its recently concluded forty-fourth session must be adhered to and implemented fully - including those that relate to retention of the existing sanctions against South Africa.Still closer to home  we are deeply concerned about the continued bleeding and suffering in the People's Republic of Angola. My Government strongly supports the peace initiatives  launched by the Angolan Government  aimed at finding a negotiated settlement with UNITA. We deeply regret the continued supply of massive and unwarranted military and financial aid to UNITA from external sources. This  in our view  constitutes interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola  as well as being detrimental to the objectives of a negotiated settlement. Now that the two parties to the conflict have agreed to seek a political solution  all external parties should desist from undertaking actions likely to jeopardize that process and should support a cease-fire as the first step towards ending the conflict.My Government would also like to seize this opportunity to commend the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique for its wisdom  courage and farsightedness in commencing negotiations with SENAMO in order that lasting peace and reconciliation might be brought about in that war-torn sister country.With regard to the continuing civil strife in Liberia  the Republic of Namibia  like the rest of the African continent  supports the peace-keeping effort of the members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). My Government appeals to the international community to provide adequate humanitarian  material and technical assistance to both the ECOWAS forces and the victims of this unfortunate civil conflict. My Government wishes the Secretary-General of the United Nations well in his efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara  so that the principle of self-determination may be realized full by the Sahraoui people.The Gulf crisis has been the subject of international outrage and condemnation. The Government of the Republic of Namibia has also condemned the naked and unprovoked aggression and illegal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. This action is a clear violation of the principles of respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of other States and thus constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law.That is why my Government has given unequivocal support to all resolutions adopted by the Security Council in respect of this unmitigated act of aggression. We therefore call upon Iraq to withdraw all its forces from Kuwait without further delay. And that withdrawal must be followed by the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait.Not too long ago Namibia was occupied by a foreign aggressor. We called upon the international community to come to our aid. This was done. Therefore we understand only too well the profound nature of the situation in Kuwait. As we see it  the central objective in the Gulf situation should be to end aggression and occupation and to re-establish the rule of law. To that end we urge that all available peaceful avenues be utilized. We are  however  deeply concerned at the scale of the military build-up that we are witnessing in the Gulf today.In this regard  my Government is concerned  in particular  that this crisis may permanently divert attention from other serious and urgent issues in the Middle East  especially the quest by the Palestinian people for their legitimate and long-overdue right to self-determination and statehood. We call upon the Israeli Government to put an end to the oppression of the Palestinian people  perpetrated in the occupied territories and to start negotiations with the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people - namely  the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).Similarly  it is the wish of my Government that the current initiatives towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Cambodia and the talks on the reunification of the two Koreas should succeed sooner rather than later.By now all of us are aware of the grave consequences of our failure seriously to address the environmental deterioration resulting from destructive human activities on a global scale. The destruction of the ozone layer could have very serious consequences for all forms of life on Earth. This means that all countries - rich and poor  industrialized and developing - must unite in a concerted world-wide effort to save our global habitat. The Government of the Republic of Namibia wants to make its contribution to this global effort.To that end my Government is exploring the possibility of holding an international conference on the issue during 1992 in Namibia. We wish to encourage research on this subject  to explore the application of ecologically sound techniques in manufacturing and processing  to tailor our development to what is compatible with the preservation of our national and global environment.The day after tomorrow the world will witness the most important gathering of Heads of State and Heads of Government in this century at the World Summit for Children. The Republic of Namibia  being perhaps one of the very few countries that have enshrined the rights of children in their Constitutions  thereby making such rights an integral part of the basic law  is looking forward to the Summit with great expectations. As I stated in my message to the Summit  it would not be enough for Governments to put their signatures to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. For the children of the world - a world whose attention is focused on the unprecedented gathering of world leaders next Sunday - the World Summit for Children and the United Nations Convention on their rights would have true meaning only if all the Heads of State and of Government gathered in New York could agree to ensure that: no child should die from a preventable disease  and Governments should strive for a 100 per cent immunization rate; that no child should be cursed with illiteracy and  ultimately  with unemployment  and that therefore primary education should be compulsory; that no child should go to sleep hungry and cold  and everything possible must be done to provide sufficient food and adequate shelter for all children; and that  as Governments  we have a responsibility and duty not to pass on planet Earth to future generations in a worse state than the one we received it in.For the sake of our children we all must  accordingly  work together towards creating an atmosphere of peace  mutual trust and understanding  with а с1лаг vision of reaching our ultimate goal  namely  that of social justice for all our peoples - and especially for our children  for they are our future."
"104",5054,"NER",45,1990,"﻿For my delegation and for myself it is a pleasure to see Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta presiding over the work of this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We congratulate him most warmly. We want him to be assured that in the performance of his duties ha will enjoy the full co-operation of the delegation of Niger. We are confident that under his distinguished guidance our work will be successful to a degree commensurate with the high hopes of our peoples individually and collectively.His predecessor  General Joseph H. Garba of Nigeria  acquitted himself of his duties in a praiseworthy manner during a particularly busy year in which the General Assembly met three times in special session. We sincerely congratulate him on his brilliant accomplishments.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  I wish once again to extend the cordial greetings of General Ali Saibou  President of the Republic of Niger  and his unreserved support for his action in the service of world peace and international co-operation. Some days ago  at the opening of this session  the Assembly welcomed into its midst the Principality of Liechtenstein as the 160th Member of the United Nations. We welcome its admission because we are already certain Liechtenstein will make a valuable contribution to the common endeavours of our nations in the service of peace and of progress.Last year from this rostrum many distinguished persons from around the world quite rightly welcomed the emergence of a new era of dialogue and international understanding born of the improving climate between the super-Powers. The atmosphere of detente and co-operation has been maintained and indeed strengthened  as could be seen - until a few weeks ago - from the growing calm and progress towards the settlement of several regional conflicts  the persistence and worsening of which had for long years marked international relations at this end of the twentieth century. It seemed that a new vision of the world and international relations  based on confidence  mutual respect and faith in the future  was replacing the atmosphere of confrontation and mistrust of the post-war period. But recent events in the Gulf have cruelly reminded us that peace is  after all  precarious and fragile  because it can be won by man's wise conduct of affaire or lost by mad behaviour.Iraq's invasion on 2 August last and then annexation of the free and sovereign Islamic and non-aligned State of Kuwait  is in every respect inadmissible behaviour that violates the most basic provisions of the Charters of the United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States  of which both countries are members.Such actions run counter to all the rules of international law  good-neighbourliness and non-resort to the use or threat of force in relations between States  and respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity and have brought about a situation that today poses the grave threat of a conflict of incalculable consequences.Such behaviour is inadmissible. It was only natural that it should have given rise to our indignation  our condemnation and our unequivocal demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi armed forces from Kuwaiti territory and the rightful return of the Government of Sheikh Jaber Al-Amad Al-Sabah. That had to be said with clarity and firmness by the Security Council  as it did not fail to do with promptness and determination  but above all Kith the unprecedented unanimity of its members.For Niger  it is not a matter of taking sides with one country against another  or a fortiori taking sides with one camp against another  or one hemisphere against another. It is a matter of simply but firmly recognising that in this unfortunate affair there has been a violation of law and the sacred principles of international morality and the conduct of States have been flouted. We must unequivocally reaffirm the primacy of law in international relations and the obligation of all States  large and small  powerful and weak  scrupulously to observe it in all circumstances  come what may.Indeed  what would become of our world if one State  by virtue of its strength and power  could do away with another with impunity; if a State  by virtue of its strength and power  could  from one day to the next  decide the fate of another and bring to an end its very existence as an independent and sovereign State?The international community's unanimous condemnation of Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait is encouraging and healthy  for it provides clear evidence that the nations of the world still hold to the sacred values of universal civilisation and that the foundations of the international legal order are still very sound.The demand for Iraq's total  immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait  for the restoration of Kuwait's national sovereignty and territorial integrity  for the immediate release of all foreigners held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait and for Iraq's cessation of threats against and intimidation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the other neighbouring States - all are  for my Government  indispensable pre-conditions for a peaceful solution to this conflict.That is why we once again address an urgent appeal both to Iraq and to all the parties involved to show restraint and wisdom  to work diligently to find an honourable political and diplomatic solution  and to be courageous in their efforts to forestall the threat of an armed confrontation whose consequences under present circumstances would be disastrous  not only for the countries of the region but for mankind as a whole.Indeed  all countries and regions of the world are already experiencing the adverse consequences of this crisis. Oil producers  oil exporters  developed countries  and developing countries especially  will pay dearly the already unacceptable bill of a new oil shock. Since it is our common duty to work together   peacefully and resolutely  to bring about the speedy end of the Gulf crisis.The crisis has somewhat eclipsed other issues  other conflicts  other tragedies which  with equal urgency  call for the collective and responsible attention of our States. Indeed  at a time when events in the Gulf continue to make headlines worldwide  there is a true human tragedy taking place in Africa - in Liberia  which is ravaged by civil war. The bloody clashes between factions which have been inflicted for several months now upon the population of this country on the verge of disintegration merit closer attention by African leaders and the international community  just as the physical and morel sufferings of the Liberian people require urgent humanitarian action.Despite the dramatic turn of events in Liberia in recent weeks  Niger believes that everything must be done - and it can be done - to restore peace and unity to that country. We hope that the next extraordinary summit meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will find a salutary solution to this question.In April this year  on the occasion of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to international economic co-operation  our Assembly welcomed to its midst the newly independent Republic of Namibia  which thus took its place among the free nations of the world after a long national liberation struggle and thanks to the courageous and judicious action of the United Nations and its Secretary-General and of the entire international community. I hail and once again congratulate our Namibian brothers and assure them of the full and complete solidarity of Niger.The world also welcomed the release of Nelson Mandela after 27 years of imprisonment. These achievements of the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa and the valiant South African people are commensurate with the sacrifices they have made; commensurate with the determination of their commitment  Above all  they constitute grounds for continuing and intensifying the pressure being exerted upon file apartheid regime. Of course  the South African Government  under the pressure of the valiant fighting forces and the international community  is trying to limit the damage by putting into place superficial reforms and changes that do not fundamentally undermine the apartheid system. But it is not reform of apartheid  or a softened apartheid with a human face that the black majority of South Africa needs. Apartheid - it can never be said too often - must disappear; it must be quite simply abolished.The measures adopted by President De Klerk  positive though they may be  are entirely inadequate. They should not lead us to relax our efforts but rather to increase the pressure and the sanctions until the minority racist Government resolutely and irreversibly commits itself to introducing a democratic and non-racial society in South Africa.And here we wish once again to affirm our solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa and its vanguard organizations  the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  and with the front-line States  whose sacrifices have been enormous and contributions invaluable  and  indeed  with all the peoples of southern Africa.In this regard  we welcome the significant progress made in the search for a true peace in Mozambique and for national reconciliation between our Angolan brothers. The goodwill that has been seen recently between the protagonists in these conflicts should be consolidated in order to accelerate and make irreversible the movement towards peace  a peace that these peoples so sorely need in order to devote themselves to the much more pressing and demanding tasks of national reconstruction and economic and social development.With regard to intra-African conflicts  the same situations as last year still prevail and persist. In Western Sahara  we welcome the patient efforts of the Secretary-General  whose settlement plan received the blessing of the Security Council  when it adopted the plan on 27 June this year. We resolutely support that plan  whoso principal aim is to enable the Organization to hold a referendum on self-determination and to establish lasting peace and stability in the region. The Secretary-General's efforts  in dose correlation with those of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  should be strengthened and maintained now more than ever before.The process between Chad and Libya launched on 31 August 1989 in Algiers seems to be continuing and becoming stronger  as the results of the recent meeting in Casablanca prove. Niger welcomes this development  which is encouraging in all respects  and appeals to both sides to turn their backs once and for all on confrontation and take the road of fraternal and constructive dialogue - the only way to bring understanding and peace to that subregion.We are deeply concerned at the painful conflict that for a year now has pitted two brother countries  Senegal and Mauritania  against each other. Niger  a member of the Inter-Ministerial Mediation Commission of the OAU  maintains excellent relations of friendship and brotherhood with both countries on the bilateral level and through our ties in various subregional co-operation institutions  and is following developments very closely. We are convinced that Senegal and Mauritania can reach an understanding and overcome this unfortunate dispute between them so that they can once again live together in the brotherhood  solidarity and good-neighbourliness that always characterised their relations in the past. That is why we again address an earnest appeal to both parties to maintain their attitude of seeking peace and to show that they are open to dialogue. The Organisation of African Unity  through the activities of the Inter-Ministerial Mediation Commission  invites them to do so and expresses its fervent hope for rapid normalisation and a final settlement of the conflict.We rejoice that it is now almost two years since peace was restored between Iraq and Iran after eight years of fratricidal war  and that Security Council resolution 598 (1987) provided the framework  the basis and the driving force of the cease-fire and the settlement of that conflict. We hope that this desire for peace will prevail elsewhere as well.May it also prevail with regard to the tragedies of all kinds that the heroic people of Palestine continues to endure. For nearly three years now the Palestinian people has pursued its sacred intifadah - launched exactly 1 000 days ago - while Israel  with impunity  goes about modifying the sociological and demographic structure of the occupied Arab territories by settling massive numbers of Jews displaced from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  and in this is following the classic pattern of colonial settlement. The international community should exert unrelenting pressure upon Israel to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories  to free Al-Quds Al-Sharif and to recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland.Niger continues to urge the convening without delay or useless manoeuvring of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The conference would endeavour to settle once and for all  on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  all aspects of this long and painful conflict.There is now a glimmer of hope in Lebanon. Some progress seems to be taking place in bringing that country security  stability  unity and territorial integrity. Niger hails the courage and determination that have made possible the achievement of the Taif agreements and the continued work of the Tripartite Arab Commission  which must overcome the difficulties and obstacles that face it end succeed in its mission of restoring the peace  tranquillity and reconciliation so sorely needed by all the people of Lebanon.Last year at this rostrum we welcomed the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement that made possible the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan which has now taken place. But we note that clashes between Afghan brothers continue  leaving countless victims and inflicting indescribable suffering upon that valiant people. That is why we are following with great attention the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  through his Special Representative  to achieve a final solution to the Afghan conflict.Similarly  we are observing with all the interest that befits our deep friendship for Cambodia the developments taking place there. The international community welcomed the decision to withdraw Vietnamese troops from that country. Even if the international Conference held in Paris from 30 July to 30 August 1989 did not fulfil all the hopes placed in it  it at least enabled the protagonists in the Kampuchean case to meet  to speak to each other and to set a new direction. The framework agreement on the Cambodian question concluded on 28 August 1990 between the five permanent members of the Security Council is a decisive turning-point. It entrusts important responsibilities to the United Nations and its Secretary-General and generates a new dynamic  which we must hope will lead to a comprehensive political agreement that will bring true and lasting peace.We are closely following the development of the situation on the Korean peninsula. The aspirations of the Korean nation to peaceful reunification are stronger today than ever before on both sides of the Pannumjone demilitarised zone. We are pleased to note that for the first time in the turbulent history of  inter-Korean relations  direct talks between the two parties at a high political level recently took place and are to continue. At a time when centripetal forces are dominating inter-State relations and when the dynamic toward unification is gaining ground against old divisions - as illustrated by the reunification of the two Yemens that has already taken place and the reunification off the two Germanys that is about to take place - it is encouraging to note the efforts exerted by the authorities of North and South Korea. These efforts deserve the blessing and support of the international community.In Cyprus  we note that talks between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island have entered a new phase  in particular with proposals for the creation of a federation composed of two regions  one administered by the Turkish Cypriot community and the other by the Greek Cypriot community.This is certainly a historic time for Central America  with a renewed diplomatic dynamic set in motion by the five Central American Presidents. The signature and implementation of the Esquipulas Agreements truly opened up the way to the guest for a just solution to the Central American crisis. We remain confident that the genius of the peoples of that region and the courage and sense of responsibility of their leaders will enable them to find the means to reach the true and lasting peace their peoples need. They deserve our full support and they may be assured that Niger encourages them in their efforts.The end of the cold war and the thaw in East-West relations have made possible ever-more-frequent recourse to negotiated solutions to disputes between States. The new type of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and the whole international legal order with respect to disarmament - treaties  conventions and agreements - are making the arms race increasingly obsolete. The world is going through a period of detente and understanding of which we must take advantage in order to bring down even the most solid barriers and do away with even the most tenacious taboos in armament matters  in order to achieve simultaneously conventional  nuclear and chemical disarmament.I said last year from this rostrum that the survival of mankind is our common responsibility and requires that we avoid a nuclear disaster  which remains a possibility. It is certainly frustrating  we said  to note the state of the world and the existence of the striking  not to say the revolting  paradox of the exponential growth of military budgets and arsenals  on the one hand  and the poverty and chronic misery of the majority of the people of the world  on the other.That is why  in Niger  we attach the greatest importance to the link between disarmament and development  and to the establishment of reliable and operational machinery to channel disarmament dividends towards development. While international detente is viewed as an urgent requirement for safeguarding  maintaining and strengthening world peace  we must note the strange paradox that the world economic situation continues inexorably to deteriorate. The victim of that situation are to be found primarily in Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean  all of them regions confronted with the tragedies of famine  poverty  illiteracy  disease  natural disasters  desertification and locust infestation. As survival societies  with disintegrated and dislocated economies ravaged by continuing crises  marginalised and increasingly excluded from world trade and international decision-making processes  the developing countries are increasingly reduced to muddling through from day to day.Of course  for a time we had nourished some hope. For example  there was the eighteenth special session  devoted to international economic co-operation and particularly to the revitalisation and economic growth of developing countries  held here last April; there was the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  which took place a few days ago in Paris; there was the fourth Lomé Convention between the countries of the European Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries; and there was the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade; and there is also the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  scheduled for 1991.All these initiatives are justified in themselves because the growth and prosperity which can be seen in the economies of the North are in stark contrast with the deterioration of the economies of the South. A marked imbalance dominates the situation with regard to exchanges between those two hemispheres  of which one grows richer while the other grows inexorably poorer.Today  with the process of universality characterising the 1980s and this latter part of the twentieth century  we can see a growing interdependence between national economies and an increase in world trade. However  despite this growing interdependence  the prosperity of the developed countries has not trickled down to the great majority of developing countries. Thus  for example  it is thought that between 1970 and 1985 the gap between the incomes and standards of living of the developed and the developing countries has continuously become greater. The average per capita income in the rich countries is today approximately 50 times that in the least developed countries.This poor performance of the third-world economies during the 1980s  which persists even today  is the outcome of a whole series of factors  essentially exogenous  such as the debt crisis  the sudden decline in world commodity prices  growing protectionism  the fall in the volume of investments and the gradual decline in official development assistance.Thus  especially where Africa is concerned  the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development is drawing to its conclusion without completely attaining its legitimate goals for the African populations. Yet that plan is the type of agreement concluded in good faith between partners accepting mutual commitments in good faith. Today we must observe that in the final analysis the commitments undertaken therein have not been realized to a reasonable extent. The mid-term review in 1988 has already noted this. The final review will  we hope  bring to light all the lessons that we should learn from what has occurred.This Assembly is about to adopt a new international strategy that will guide the fourth United Nations development decade. We have taken stock of the Third Decade  and it must be said that it was a lost decade for the development of the third world  which bases its hopes on the new strategy. Therefore we hope that the fourth decade will bring innovative answers to the earnest questions of the poor  in the spirit of solidarity and joint responsibility that should characterize contemporary international relations. We must recall  in this regard  that during its eighteenth special session  held last April  the General Assembly conducted a very painstaking analysis of the world economic situation. The possibilities for the improvement of the situation of the developing countries contained in the Declaration that was adopted indicate what is at stake at the end of the twentieth century and the challenges that the international community must face. The declaration is also an expression of faith and a tangible expression of the predominant role that the United Nations intends to play as the preferred framework for multilateral co-operation and also as a profound force for international solidarity.The Government of Niger sincerely hopes that this Declaration  unanimously adopted  will mark the real resumption of the North-South dialogue  the joint expression of a determination to reverse these trends. If we devote ourselves to this task  we can save mankind from the major dangers it faces today because of the terrible frustrations encountered by the majority.While questions of peace  security and economic development remain at the forefront of our concerns  they must today vie with other priorities. I refer to social and environmental issues.Questions relating to children  drugs and AIDS now have high priority on international agendas. Here in this Assembly last year we adopted the important Convention on the Bights of the Child  which scores of countries  including my own  have already signed and ratified  thus expressing the great importance they attach to this essential component of our societies.Yesterday  on the initiative of the United Nations Children's Fund  a historic event took place the World Summit for Children. This is the first time in the history of mankind that so many world leaders from every continent have met together to engage in a true profession of faith concerning the protection  development and survival of children. Niger associates itself with those nations that have expressed the hope that the Declaration issued at this historic Summit will be rapidly given effect and constitute a point of departure for world-wide concerted action for children.As regards the war on drugs and the illicit traffic in narcotics  we consider this a matter of high priority. This phenomenon threatens States  entire regions of the world and even civilisation itself. We express our solidarity with countries such as Colombia and others that have engaged in a struggle against the drug Mafia. However  concerted world-wide action is necessary to bring this calamity to an end.The spread of AIDS  which is increasing day by day throughout the world  is of concern to all Governments. No country is safe from AIDS. No country can combat it on its own. It is international action of broad scope that is needed. Substantial resources  especially financial  must be mobilized to sustain that action in order to bring the best chances of success. The United Nations and the World Health Organization primarily but also non-governmental organizations and competent national institutions should be the driving force in this crusade against AIDS.I now turn to development. Increasingly  nations are unanimously realizing the full value of a healthy environment and the great risks to our planet of the generalized and increasing deterioration of the environment. The struggle to protect the environment has today become a cardinal imperative.Niger  because of its geographical situation at the heart of the Sahel  is deeply concerned over the various problems engendered by environmental deterioration. Climatic modifications acting on seasonal rainfall make all forecasts for agriculture from year to year unreliable. Desertification and soil erosion are depriving our hard-working populations of their best lands  which constitute a major factor of production. All these elements are detrimental to the food self-sufficiency of our populations. However  environmental deterioration beyond my country also affects the atmosphere  the waters and the ozone layer  which has already been pierced in some places; and then there are acid rain  toxic wastes  industrial wastes and so on. All of this shows us how the environment problem must be approached as an integral part of development. The development plans of States and town and country planning should be based on a close relationship between environment and development from now on. Ш must stress the great importance we attach to the United Nations Conference in Brazil in 1992  which is to adopt a world plan of action for environmental protection to preserve present and future conservations from ecological catastrophe.Last year I indicated here the political and institutional process going on in my country and the great ambition of President Ali Saibou for Niger and its people to restore a republican legal order after several years under exceptional legal regimes.Niger currently has republican institutions  the fruit of collective efforts and resolute will to join the ranks of fully democratic countries  giving each citizen the full enjoyment of his rights  with equal awareness of his duties.However  Niger  like other countries of the third world  has not been spared by an unrelenting economic and financial crisis that runs counter to our every effort. I touched on some of the elements of this crisis earlier. It demands of us self-control  courage and serenity. In a spirit of openness and responsibility  it has led my Government  jointly with other sectors of society  to set in motion a number of political and economic responses.Politically  our people  based on a lucid and responsible assessment of the evolution of the society of Niger  sees itself as an integral part of the general trends in the world  seeking ways and means for greater democracy and for the expression of multiple and even contradictory views  in short  the yearned-for advent of political pluralism. To this end  at its session held last June the supreme organ of my country  the High Council of National Policy  decided to revise the National Charter of the Constitution. But  it must be understood that this will  above all  must be based on the conclusion of endogenous processes particular to our people at this stage of internal development and its sociological and political evolution. This democratic development is finding a natural concomitant in a vast and ambitious programme of structural reform  whose purpose is to put the economy of Niger effectively on the road to endogenous and self-sustaining growth once again. We intend to promote private initiative and the spirit of creativity and competitiveness necessary to enhance Niger's economic and commercial fabric.Such an objective will certainly entail sacrifices  as it requires considerable external resources  and its implementation still requires unpopular social costs that generate movements that are hard to contain.But  as I have said earlier  structural adjustment in our economies is an inescapable imperative. Thus  our Government must seek  in a spirit of joint responsibility  with the social partners and with external partners  accommodations that can preserve social peace and the development process.Let me express our appreciation for the efforts made by our bilateral and multilateral partners and  particularly  the understanding shown by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. I hope that the statements we have heard here and the favourable measures announced last week at the equal meetings of the Bretton Hoods institutions will rapidly take concrete shops  especially in the area of debt and official development assistance.These problems are not peculiar to Niger. Their solution  we repeat  will determine the harmony  equilibrium and the very survival of mankind. They are the major challenge to the international community. We must face these challenges together. We must collectively assume our responsibilities to present and future generations. We must show our commitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations - the ideals of peace  solidarity and progress for all peoples. We must be present at our rendezvous with history."
"105",5099,"NGA",45,1990,"﻿I congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your election is testimony to the high esteem in which both you and your country  Malta  are held by the international community  we are confident that you will provide effective leadership to the work of the Assembly.Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to ray compatriot  Major-General Joseph Garba  President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. I congratulate him for a successful tenure and for bringing honour to our country. May I also thank the international community and  in particular  Africa for the support accorded Nigeria during the period we hold the presidency.I commend the efforts and the contribution of the Secretary-General to the enhancement of the role of our Organisation.Since the last session our Organisation has undergone positive changes in its membership. On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria  I wish again to welcome the Republic of Namibia to membership of the United Nations. In this connection  we commend the role played by the Organisation and the entire international community in the attainment of Namibia's independence. May I also welcome our newest Member  Liechtenstein. Similarly  we congratulate the Government and the people of Yemen for their reunification. In the same vein  we also look forward to the historic reunification of Germany. We expect that a united Germany will be accorded a significant role within the Organisation. We expect  through these changes  that the United Nations will reflect not only the new realities in world affairs  but will also embark on equitable geographical representation at the highest level of the Organisation. Indeed  the time has come for the United Nations to be restructured to give Africa a permanent seat in the Security Council. Other regions equally deserve consideration. This will give full expression to the universality of our Organisation.Since the last session of our Assembly  new positive trends have emerged in the international political environment. There has been a new universal wave of democracy. The Berlin Hall has been pulled down. Even more important  in the immediate aftermath of the cold war  ideological rivalry has been replaced by increased super-Power co-operation  opening the way to the enhanced relevance of the United Nations in global affairs. We can only hope that these positive trends will provide the requisite climate to enable the developing countries to pursue their objective of development in freedom and peace.Despite some positive treads  there are still unresolved questions which may put in jeopardy the emerging world order based on co-operation. The breach of peace and security in the Gulf  which we have all condemned  the threat of renewed conflict in the Middle East and the economic stagnation and decline in the developing countries  all point to the fact that our optimism should be guarded  and that security and survival remain the most important questions on the international political agenda.The crisis in the Gulf constitutes the greatest threat to international peace and security today. Nigeria believes firmly in the non-use of force in international relations. It is for this reason that Nigeria commends the Security Council for all the measures it has adopted in dealing with the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Nigeria not only endorses all these measures  but has also taker  steps to implement appropriate Security Council resolutions. Nigeria once again calls on Iraq to pull out  unconditionally  all its forces from Kuwait. Kuwait is a sovereign nation. Consequently  its territorial integrity cannot and should not be compromised.It is gratifying to see a vibrant and enhanced role for the United Nations in the emerging world order. We hope that this swift and collective response and action in the Gulf will be the norm in cases of tension for all time.The experience of the developing countries in the 19308 has not borne out the notion that sustained growth in the industrialised North would serve as an engine of growth in the South. While the industrialised nations have had about eight years of uninterrupted expansion  the economies of the vast majority of the countries in the South have either stagnated or even declined. This emerging dual pattern in the economic performance of Member States of the Organisation is attributable to many factors. Some of these factors are the escalating debt burden  the sharp fall in commodity prices  protectionism  the decline in foreign investment  and the net transfer of resources from the developing to the developed nations. It is indeed a fact that the developed countries have not pursued or sustained policies that aid the economic growth of developing countries.The pervasive and deep decline among developing countries in the 1980s indicates that poor domestic economic management is not the main culprit for their economic woes as commonly suggested. The fact is that the external shocks of the 1980s have had a devastating impact on many of our economies. Nigeria's plight and experience is very illustrative. Our oil export revenue fell by 75 per cent between 1980 and 1986. On the other hand  our external debt rose from $3.4 billion in 1978 to $30.7 billion in 1988  due in large measure to a sharp rise in interest rates. The combined effects of these externally-induced shocks have led to s dramatic reduction in the living standards of our people.In the period 1989 to 1990 the total debt stock of all developing countries stood at $1 300 billion. That figure is nearly twice our export earnings  with our annual interest obligations currently at about $100 billion. And the debt  of course  is still growing.On our continent  Africa  total debt stock rose from approximately $48 billion in 1978 to an estimated $250 billion in 1989. The effect of this debt burden on sub-Saharan Africa has been devastating. By the end of 1988  sub-Saharan African debt was equal to its gross national product and three and a half times its export earnings. Most countries in the sub-region have found it impossible to meet debt-servicing obligations African countries have had to bear debt-servicing obligations averaging between 35 per cent to 40 per cent of their export earnings  a most punishing burden for such low-income economies to bear.As a result of the negative net transfer of resources  principally arising from debt-servicing  developing countries have suffered painful reductions in income. Consequently  within the decade of the 1980s  six African countries were reclassified from middle-income to low-income economies. On this scale of dismal economic performance  arising from an unfavourable international economic environment  the number of African countries classified as least developed countries increased from 17 to 28. There is a real fear that this number will increase if present global economic policies are not redressed.The Nigerian delegation calls on the major industrialised countries to exhibit the political will needed to address and resolve the main economic problems of our particularly the debt problem. The resolution of the debt problem  will significantly reduce the pernicious phenomena of the negative transfer of resources and therein release resources needed for development and growth.We recognise that effective solutions to the debt problem must be the joint responsibility of debtor and creditor countries as well as the multilateral financial institutions and the commercial banks. Recent initiatives aimed at the reduction of the debt stock and debt service are well conceived. However  these initiatives are not sufficiently far-reaching to deal with the profound crisis that has already wrecked and prevented the growth of the economies of many developing countries. What is required is co-ordinated and intensified international economic co-operation to address the economic problems of our era  as well as the proposal  adoption and implementation of durable  far-reaching and forward-looking solutions.We urge the developed nations to rise to the challenge posed by the debt problem. Effective measures should be devised and implemented that would remove the other obstacles that impede the rapid economic development of the developing countries. We know that we have the ultimate responsibility for our development. In this regard  we in Nigeria have embarked on major reforms and restructuring of our economy. In spite of these measures  the flow of foreign investment and capital into our economy has not matched our expectations and sacrifices. The growth and development of our economies will not reach their full potential without profound structural changes in the global economic and financial system. Related to the question of economic development is the issue of disarmament. In our view  the question of disarmament is not only restricted to the immediate benefit of the preservation of life  although that is important  but also to the relationship between disarmament and development. The disarmament question is  therefore  important in terms of both military and non-military security.Recent developments in disarmament negotiations gave us grounds for hope. Unfortunately  this hope has not been justified  and the expectations of the ""peace dividend"" are rapidly receding.An important component of our common security must be a binding universal acceptance of the principle of the non-use of force in resolving international disputes. Such a security system must also involve deep reductions in existing global stocks of nuclear and conventional weapons  armed forces and related expenditure  which are draining the world's limited resources and impoverishing humanity.In our region  Nigeria is proud to be associated with the various efforts towards regional peace and security. The turning of Africa into a nuclear-free zone  as embodied in the 1964 Declaration of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  remains our goal. Our commitment to the strengthening of peace and security in the South Atlantic region is solid. We demonstrated this commitment when  earlier this year  we hosted the Second Meeting of the States of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation of the South Atlantic in Abuja  during which concrete decisions on the practical ways of accelerating the objectives of the zone were reached.We must preserve our environment. Irreparable damage to our environment will have tragic consequences for our civilisation. Environmental degradation caused by the negative effects of scientific and technological development has  in many cases  already led to adverse changes in the environment. These changes threaten the life-sustaining eco-systems and pose a threat to the health and well-being of mankind. There is therefore  an urgent and compelling need for global action to deal with such environmental issues as deforestation  desertification  protection of the ozone layer and more rational use of land and water resources and energy.Developing countries are highly vulnerable to environmental degradation.Owing to the low levels of technological development  our countries are ill-equipped to deal effectively with the complex problems of environmental abuse. Consequently  the developed countries bear a special responsibility to promote environmentally sound policies that will contribute to sustainable development.International development co-operation for environmental protection should be a central task for this decade. Development co-operation must be based on respect for nationally determined goals and priorities. However  we should not be expected to accept development assistance on terns which are detrimental to our national development. There is now an urgent need for all countries to put in place effective standards for the disposal of toxic wastes within their own borders. Rigorous standards should also be observed for the trans-boundary movement of toxic wastes. Under no conditions should toxic and hazardous wastes be sent to countries that are technologically incapable of their safe disposal.We have recently set up the Federal Environmental Protection Agency  because of the importance the government of Nigeria attaches to environmental protection and security. In this regard  we look forward to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which will take place in Brazil in 1992.Human rights are of cardinal importance. The promotion of the well-being of the individual  and respect for and observance of his fundamental rights are directly related to the progress of the individual and his society. We hold the view that  whatever the historical background or the material circumstances of peoples  their civil and political rights  on the one hand  end their economic  social and cultural rights  on the other  are indivisible and interdependent category of right is more important than the other. Governments that engage in the flagrant violation of the rights of their people provoke crisis  conflict and instability. Although much remains to be done in the area of peace  the United Nations has been impressive in setting standards in this field.At its forty-fourth session  the General Assembly requested the views of governments on the need to convene a world conference on human rights. Therefore   Mr. President  e affirm our support for this call. Nigeria is strongly committed to the principle of political pluralism. In this connection  we have commenced the process of democratisation of our governmental system. We have embarked on a political transition programme to full democracy  which will lead to the election of a democratic government. Indeed  the third tier of government would be elected in December this year.The problem of production  supply  demand  trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs is one of increasing concern. A comprehensive approach is required to deal with this problem. Bold and concerted international and national action is required. Consequently  we have established the National Law Enforcement Agency to deal with the problem. We are co-operating with other governments to ensure the effectiveness of the campaign against drug trafficking and consumption. However  only a solution that addresses the demand and supply aspects of the problem has any chance of success.One of our objectives in Africa is to promote peace and security. It is in this context that the Economic Community of West African States seats a peace-keeping force to Liberia. Our goals are to facilitate a cease-fire among the different warring groups  to protect the lives of Liberians and other nationals. To create stable security conditions in the country  and to create an atmosphere conducive to the installing of a democratically elected government.We hope that the international community will support this peace process.There is a serious refugee problem in the subregion arising from the Liberian conflict. We appeal to the international community for urgent humanitarian assistance. We also call for logistic and other related assistance to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (EC0M0G) in its peace-keeping operations.The situation in southern Africa remains of primary concern to my country.This year has truly witnessed important developments in southern Africa. These developments are a result of our collective and individual resolve to eradicate the method of apartheid  which dehumanises both its victims and its perpetrators alike. Nigeria  indeed Africa and the entire international community celebrated the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela. We welcome the dialogue between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Government of South Africa. Nigeria notes with interest the opening of the National Party to all races. We also welcome the recent meeting between representatives of other political groups within South Africa. Notwithstanding these positive changes  we must not forget that the major pillars of apartheid remain intact. The racist Constitution remains the basic law in South Africa. Black South Africans are still victims of oppression  of hatred and of direct and inspired racist killings. We urge the international community to maintain existing sanctions against South Africa until the establishment of a free  non-racial  democratic and undivided South Africa. The international community cannot accept anything less. The consensus Declaration  adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session provides the framework for the peaceful elimination of apartheid and the resolution of the crises in southern Africa. Elsewhere in the region  particularly is Angola and Mozambique  we hope that the different groups involved in civil conflicts will have recourse to negotiations  dialogue and other peaceful means is the resolution of their differences. We shall continue  as is the past  to play our part as peace-makers.On Western Sahara  Nigeria notes with satisfaction the recent actions by the Secretary-General and the Security Council. We welcome the adoption of the initial report of the Secretary-General on the proposed implementations of the joist OAU-United Nations proposal for the peaceful settlement of the crisis. We are prepared to play any suitable role is the proposed United Nations mission for the referendum in Wasters Sahara. In other areas of conflict  such as Kampuchea  Central America and Afghanistan  Nigeria will continue to support and encourage regional and international efforts for attaining peace  security and stability.Nigeria welcomed the recent meeting of the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas. We hope that such contacts will further advance efforts towards peaceful reunification. That is without prejudice to the desire of the Korean people for membership of the United Nations.The question of a homeland for the Palestinians is at the heart of the Middle East problem. The Palestinians must be allowed to enjoy their right to self-determination. The lessons of the past and the present show that  as Members of the United Nations committed to the maintenance of international peace and security  we should never be complacent. The struggle to achieve peace and security is a never-ending one. In spite of the gains resulting primarily from increased super-Power co-operation  recent events show that obstacles remain. This must compel us to be more vigilant.Politics and economics are interwoven. It is therefore regrettable that the same concern and commitment in global political and security matters have not yet been extended to the economic well-being of most of the developing countries. Africa remains marginalised in the evolving world order. In spite of our best efforts at economic development  poverty has become more widespread in our continent. This  I believe  poses a threat to world peace and security.None the less  as we peer into the future we are full of hope. We are confident that we shall reach our collective goal of a peaceful world devoid of man-made injustice. The Government and the people of Nigeria will not only dream  but will continue to work tirelessly for an Africa that is socially at peace  economically developed and politically plural and democratic. To achieve this we ask for the understanding and co-operation of the international community. Indeed  we ask for genuine partnership. We need partnership to uproot the scourge of apartheid and racism. We need partnership to eliminate and banish large-scale poverty and disease. We need partnership to check environmental degradation. We need partnership to promote respect for human rights in all their ramifications. And we need partnership to advance the process of political democratisation on our continent. Above all  as Members of this Organisation  we need to summon the political will to increase and sustain the commitment to a humane and just world economic order. "
"106",5144,"NIC",45,1990,"﻿Forty-five years ago  the United Nations was formed to turn guns into ploughshares. Today  in Nicaragua  we are turning this great dream of the United Nations into a reality. This past 25 February  under United Nations auspices  the Nicaraguan people voted for peace. That day marked a grand moment in our history. After more than a half century of oppression  the Nicaraguan people broke free of their prison of ideologies and dictators. The silent act of thousands of our people in the electoral precincts became a vigorous shout in rejection of violence and in favour of peaceful and civic ways of resolving social conflict and political differences.The Nicaraguan people resoundingly voted for the Government I am honoured to preside over today. They voted to unite us  firmly and forever  to all other countries which have chosen the path of freedom. The United Nations were guarantors of this election  the first truly free election we have had in 169 years of existence as a republic. I  like many other Nicaraguans of my generation  had for the first time in my life the opportunity to vote freely. In the name of all Nicaraguans  I deeply thank this world forum and all the other international organizations and nations which have supported our desire to be free. You made it possible for Nicaragua on 25 February  to enter a new era. In only five months we have achieved peace  culminating with the successful demilitarization and disarmament of the 21 000 members of the Nicaraguan resistance. In less than five months  we have substantially reduced the size of the Nicaraguan armed forces  going from an army of 96 000 members to one of 34 000. We are also achieving the removal of all weapons that have been in civilian hands  burying under concrete over 18 000 rifles which belonged to political forces. We are pushing hard to conclude negotiations concerning the limitation of military arms and personnel. Nicaragua's success in disarmament has set an example by destroying weapons such as those I today presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.We view as a constructive step for all humanity the disarmament agreements which have been reached between the United States and the Soviet Union. But there is something more. Today I should like to proclaim democracy as the heritage of all mankind. None the less  we must be deeply concerned with what it would mean to lose the birth of democracy in Nicaragua  which has already cost so much  because it has been an important step towards peace and stability throughout all of Central America. Were we to lose peace and not consolidate our democracy  we would be erasing one of the great conquests of America. Therefore  from this rostrum  I call upon all democracies the world over to commit themselves to the cause of Nicaraguan democracy.In these five months of our new Government  our people have experienced unprecedented liberty and respect for human rights. In Nicaragua  the people are no longer afraid to live in their homeland. In Nicaragua  they are no longer afraid to work. In Nicaragua  they are no longer afraid of criticizing their government. There is no longer any fear to produce. Small farmers  manufacturers and merchants  all are free to buy and sell their products freely in the marketplace. Parents no longer fear for their children’s lives. In Nicaragua  they no longer fear going to school to study. They no longer fear thinking for themselves. There is no longer any fear for the future. In Nicaragua  there is no longer any fear of peace. The people know the words of Pope John Paul II  who said the ""new face of peace today is the promotion of development"".In the name of all Nicaraguans  I can say today from this global forum that we Nicaraguans have faith in God  faith in freedom  faith in democracy  faith in our homeland  faith in ourselves and faith in all our sister nations which have given us their support and understanding. But there is something of even greater importance. My homeland  Nicaragua  is not only in tune with the democratic currents flowing across the world. It is also the fruit of a new regional movement which the United Nations has actively supported and protected with creativity  originality and courage. I have the honour of representing my country in a year of special significance in modern history.Nicaragua is firmly committed to maintaining its independence vis-à-vis hegemonic interests. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Nicaragua will assume the challenge of transcending ideological barriers which have separated us and removing them. Nicaragua condemns the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq  and supports the resolutions adopted by this Organization's Security Council. At the same time we welcome the release of Nelson Mandela and support the elimination of racism and apartheid.	.The reunification of the German people is of great significance to my people and stands as a living example of the success of reconciliation. I dream of a unified Central America. I dream of a demilitarized Central America. I dream of a Central America that lives in freedom. I dream of a Central America engaged in permanent dialogue. I dream of a Central America enjoying progress.We hope that the world will share and continue to support efforts in favour of a democratic Central America  demilitarized and free of any military presence so that one day we can proclaim to the world that Central America is a zone of peace and co-operation. It is time to put an end to violence and armaments and to start working towards the supremacy of civil society over arms. No longer should any Central American have to bow his or her head or lower his dignity in the face of force or dictatorship. We have begun the great revolution of non-violence  the civic and democratic revolution of the vote and of respect for each individual ' s dignity  freedom and rights. We believe that understanding among nations is the route to international reconciliation.This revolution  which binds Central America together more and more  advances political integration with the establishment of a Central American parliament. We aspire to the formation of a Central American economic community. We have agreed on a common strategy which will permit our economies to participate under competitive conditions in an economic plan of action which is essential to the life of our region. But we cannot restrict ourselves to our own regional sphere. Latin America is the dream of Bolivar  and is the name of our great community. All in America that is great  is the result of unity. Our great revolutions - the political ones for independence  as well as the cultural ones - have been affected by an awareness of unity  which is reborn again today with the triumph of democracy. Only as a regional community will we gain the power to solve such grave common problems as the external debt  and enable our economies to participate in international markets. We are small and we are poor but our ideals give us stature.The national reconciliation we are seeking in Nicaragua  as in ongoing efforts towards reconciliation throughout the world today  has no grander objective than to strengthen individual rights. The smaller a country the better it understands and feels the value of human rights. In this sense  and in the name of Nicaragua  I proclaim our firm commitment to support the United Nations Decade for International Law.Permit me now to turn from the encouraging prospects for the future to the urgent needs of the present. It has been said  in honour of our gender  that women are the guardian angels of the present. A woman with a child in her arms knows that the future is the present. Without doubt we in Nicaragua have opened our arms to peace and democracy. Today Nicaragua confronts a situation similar to that faced by some countries at the end of the Second World War. We know that our own efforts will be essential and a turning-point in the reactivation of our economy  through an economic and social compact  a process we began on the twentieth of this month among workers  business and government. This is a new style of government in Nicaragua.We recognize and accept our responsibility to realize adjustments and transformations which will make our economies viable. However  this effort must be complemented by international co-operation  including preferential treatment. We view international co-operation  not as a substitute for our own efforts  but as a necessary additional element to achieve steady development and growing participation in international trade.To support our democracy is to extend the frontiers of liberty and justice in the world. Those who understand that know that Nicaragua's democratization  and its economic recovery  represent a necessary pre-condition for the consolidation of peace throughout the region.I should like to emphasize the following point  which is crucial if my country is to achieve peace and democracy  and that is the need to support the incorporation of thousands of Nicaraguan refugees who have been displaced  or demobilized from the Nicaraguan resistance  and those soldiers affected by the reductions in the army  into the productive process of the nation.Lastly  I wish to refer to the enormous burden which the foreign debt represents for our people. The various initiatives and debt strategies which have been used around the world signify real progress in some cases. We view with optimism President Bush's initiative for the Americas  based on proposals for trader debt and development  which need to be analysed carefully by our countries. None the less these efforts to date are not enough. It is necessary for the international community to give us greater support with the goal of making our heavy debt burden more bearable. Then our countries will be able to direct their financial resources towards the urgent economic and social necessities they face.I believe that a renegotiation of the debt in concessionary terms for the Central American countries must be viewed from a moral perspective  not solely in economic terms but rather as a necessary step towards resolving the painful development crisis which many of our countries face and which ultimately hurts us all. Only in this way can we create and bequeath a more just and stable world to the men and women of tomorrow  the children of today - our children  our grandchildren and other children like them - for whom we have to fight  as my late husband  Pedro Joaquin Chamorro  used to say  sometimes to the very death. In this sense we express our firm support of the World Summit for Children  our total conviction that any action by the United Nations today would lack purpose if it did not have the clear desire to achieve for our nations what we want for our children. Nicaragua has been like a rock  placed by geography and by history at the centre of the American world. This rock feels the force of all the political and social winds and is lashed by universal trends. All our heroes have fought against empire-builders and invading forces. The destiny of our nationality seems to transcend boundaries. For this reason  if there is a country which stands at one  profoundly at one with this Organization  it is my homeland. Please do not leave us alone. "
"107",5191,"NLD",45,1990,"﻿May I  first of all  extend to Mr. de Marco my congratulations on his election as President of this Assembly. With someone of his wisdom and experience in the Chair  the Assembly is undoubtedly in good hands. We can count on the constructive co-operation of the Netherlands delegation. Obviously  Mr. Vice-President  these remarks apply to you also and to the other officers of the Assembly.Secondly  I extend a warm welcome to Liechtenstein  a new Member of this family of nations. Earlier this week my Italian counterpart  Mr. De Michelis  presented the common position of the 12 States members of the European Community on a wide range of international issues. That allows Us to concentrate on a few subjects that have my country's special attention.So far  1990 has been a year of spectacular success in international political affairs but  as we all know  it has also witnessed a serious setback. The cold war - a costly and sometimes frightening confrontation between East and West - is over. The democratisation of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries has freed Europe from an old antagonism and has paved the way for increasing co-operation in arms control  trade  cultural exchanges  human rights and environmental protection.The forthcoming unification of Germany symbolises this process of peaceful change - the healing of a once bitterly-divided Europe. We rejoice with our German friends  who are also our neighbours that the unity that they have long sought will finally become reality on 3 October.The improved climate between East and West also positively influences multilateral co-operation  as is proved by the handling by the United Nations of the present crisis in the Gulf. The immediate cause of that crisis represents a dramatic step backward in international relations. It is a saddening paradox that  while in one part of the world - on the European continent - new policies have made possible improved relations and a process of substantial arms reductions  in another part of the world brutal force is again being used to settle political differences. Whatever disputes Iraq may have had with Kuwait; nothing can justify its naked aggression against a sovereign State Member of the United Nations. The very core of the United Nations Charter – the maintenance of peace and the prevention of aggression - is at stake. It is heartening to observe that the United Nations is at last fulfilling its historic Missions. Consensus between the great Powers has bean instrumental in this. Fortunately it is now more widely realised that greater power brings greater responsibility. We therefore welcome the action that the Security Council has taken in response to Iraq's aggression  at the heart of which lies its call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait  for the release of hostages  and for the restoration of the legitimate Government of that country. The Kingdom of the Netherlands fully supports the implementation of the Council's resolutions. Dutch naval and air forces have been made available to help ensure compliance with the embargo resolutions against Iraq and to contribute to security in the Gulf.We strongly condemn the actions taken by Iraq against foreign nationals in Kuwait and Iraq and against diplomatic missions in Kuwait. We hold the Government of Iraq responsible under international law for its manipulation of innocent civilians for purposes of international blackmail.It is our sincere hope that this conflict will be resolved peacefully. But we should always remember that it is Iraq that broke the peace in the first place. Its shameless annexation of Kuwait could not be left unanswered. Sometimes the countering of might with might is unavoidable  as is being underscored by more than SS United Nations Members that have deployed forces in the region. Far from harbouring aggressive thoughts of their own  they seek to uphold world order. The alternative is chaos and a free-for-all  from which everyone - not just the small and weak - would suffer. The sad story of the League of Nations has taught the world that w· must stand firm and united in the face of aggression. Just as in Europe  we should prefer to see  regional solutions to the regional problems in the Middle East. In principle  therefore  we understand the call for an Arab solution to the conflict. We are dealing here  however  with the aggression of an Arab State against another Arab State; and it is at the request of Arab States  which feel threatened by Iraq  that countries outside the region have come to their aid. Moreover  international aggression and violent conquest transcend the confines of the region  because they strike at the heart of the United Nations Charter. Finally  legitimate interest in the stability of that part of the world is certainly not limited to the region itself. It should therefore be clear that an Arab solution cannot be a substitute for Security Council resolutions but could only take shape subject to Iraq's full compliance with then.Meanwhile an embargo that is strictly abided by and properly enforced offers the best  if not the last  hope for a peaceful settlement of this conflict. In this contest we welcome the adoption yesterday of Security Council resolution 670 (1990)  containing measures that further tighten the embargo. It is another clear signal to Iraq that time is not working in its favour and that aggression does not pay. Aggression entails human suffering and disastrous damage to the international economy - the most vulnerable economies in particular. The Netherlands  together with its partners in the European Community  is committed to extending assistance to these countries to enable them to fulfil their obligations under the Security Council resolutions.Effective international co-operation within the framework of the United Nations has taken on a new dimension. By applying the instruments provided for in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  the world shows its willingness to unite for collective security. In recent years we have seen successful United Nations peace-keeping efforts  permitted by propitious international political conditions. If Iraq complies with the Security Council's resolutions and withdraws from Kuwait  the situation thereafter could very well require deployment of a United Nations peace-keeping force.If  however  Iraq continues to refuse to comply with them and persists in its illegal occupation of Kuwait  additional action  consistent with the United Nations Charter  will be called for to enforce the restoration of peace. Clearly  if that situation should arise - and we all hope it will not - we look to the United Nations as the instrument for enforcement. Our fervent hope that we shall reach a peaceful solution should not prevent us from being prepared for such a contingency.Our objectives are clear  but we do not know how  in the end  they will be achieved. What we do know is that this crisis is a test for the political resolve of the international community and of the United Nations. Chapter VII  regarded at the time of drafting as a great innovation  has never been applied so comprehensively. This crisis is an important demonstration of the possibilities of multilateral action for upholding vital principles of a just world order.The Netherlands remains deeply concerned by the endemic instability of the Middle East. The Arab-Israeli conflict  the Palestinian problem and the situation in Lebanon are still unresolved. Any link between the solution of these problems and the Iraqi aggression should  however  be firmly rejected  as this would only give the appearance of justice to an unjust cause and thereby frustrate solution of the Gulf crisis.Why is the Middle East such a powder-keg  such a warehouse packed full of arms  ready to explode at any time? Why is there no development towards stability and peaceful change  comparable to the one we are witnessing in other parts of the world? It seems to us that a crucial political precondition is missing as long as there are parties that do not accept reality as it is  but constantly try to postpone the inevitable. I refer to the contempt for existing borders  to the negation of existing statehood and to the disregard for legitimate political aspirations. It is hard to believe that peace will come to the Middle East as long as Israel feels insecure because it is not accepted by its Arab neighbours. Equally  there will be no peace for Israel as long as it does not permit Palestinian self-determination in the occupied territories.We believe that a declared state of non-belligerency between the countries of the region is essential for the revival of the peace process. Therefore we call upon the Arab States formally to end the state of war with Israel and normalise relations with that country in the context of the peace process. Equally  we call upon Israel to comply with resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) within the framework of a comprehensive peace agreement.Furthermore  in our view dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians remains indispensable. Even if one has to admit that the opportunities which presented themselves during the past years have been missed and that the prospects for peace have been undermined by the position the Palestine Liberation Organisation has adopted in the Gulf crisis  we nevertheless remain convinced that there is no other way ahead for Israel and the Palestinians than to demonstrate mutual recognition of fundamental rights and legitimate aspirations. Subsequent to the solution of the Gulf crisis  a renewed and determined effort by the international community is needed to induce the parties concerned to accept these prerequisites and to cross the threshold on the arduous road to a lasting peace.With the lessons of the past in mind  notably in Europe  it seems that more democracy  more respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms  in combination with more arms control instead of arms build-up  are vital ingredients to be more emphatically inserted into the Middle East peace process if durable stability and security are to be attained. While the positive trend in both nuclear and conventional arms control between East and Nest is very encouraging  such progress is distinctly lacking in other parts of the world  as the Gulf crisis shows. The Middle East especially is the scene of a rapid arms build-up. Weapons of every description ~ conventional  chemical  biological - are concentrated there on a huge scale whereas nuclear weapons seen to be imminent. Various means for delivery of such weapons are available in the region  including missiles  some of them with considerable reach.Let existing instruments be fully applied to reverse this arms race  both worldwide and in the region. As for the danger of nuclear arms proliferation  there must be recognition of the vital need to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. All States of the region should become parties to that Treaty. The Treaty's safeguard system should be utilised in full  so as to include special inspections. In the same view the biological weapons Treaty must become a more effective barrier against proliferation. It should be reinforced by area-wide accession and full ratification  further confidence·-building measures and  ultimately  a credible verification regime. We will be putting forward proposals to that end at next year's review conference.It goes without saying that the Gulf crisis can only strengthen the urgency of a global ban on chemical weapons. After 20 years of negotiations  an effectively verifiable treaty with universal participation is long overdue. 1992 should really be not only our target but also our deadline. The Netherlands fully supports the Australian end French proposal to hold a ministerial conference early next year to provide the necessary political impetus. I would remind representatives that the Netherlands has offered to host the envisaged chemical weapons treaty organisation.In the mean time  measures to stop further proliferation of biological and chemical weapons end their precursors as well as missiles end their technology are indispensable. The Netherlands recently joined the Missile Technology Control Regime.An arms build-up is mainly a result and not a cause of tension as the cold war has taught us. That explains why w· soon expect to sign a comprehensive treaty on the substantial reduction of conventional forces in Europe. In other regions of the world these political pre-conditions are not yet fulfilled  so it may be hard for countries to feel secure enough to restrict themselves in this respect. That is why we feel it is so important that the ground rules for stability in the Middle East which I referred to before  find acceptance. These should pave the way for more comprehensive security arrangements in which confidence-building measures and conventional arms control have a prominent place  and they will help to counter proliferation of weapons in the region. We should realise  however  that there will always remain a dilemma between legitimate security needs  on the one hand  and the objective of avoiding an arms race  on the other. In this context  we shall also have to look at ways and means to restrain arms exports - a subject which has been broached for the first time in the United Nations.Let me now strike a positive note. The combination of greatly improved East-West relations and the better functioning of the United Nations have a wholesome effect on the quest for solutions to regional conflicts. In a number of cases this has inspired the local or regional parties to stop feuding and start looking for a fair and lasting compromise. The prospects for resolving the conflict in Cambodia and the prospects for fundamental change in South Africa give rise to some optimism.The comprehensive peace plan which the Five have developed for Cambodia contains a solid framework for the four warring factions to settle their differences and free their sorrowing country from the scourge of war and repression. The recent acceptance of the plan by the Cambodian parties  and their further agreement as to the details of the arrangement  should allow the country to make a safe transition to a democratic political system  with its sovereignty restored. The Cambodians must finally be free from the killing fields and from foreign interventions. We welcome the decision that Cambodia will be represented in the United Rations and elsewhere by the newly founded Supreme National Council. And if the Netherlands should be called upon to contribute to United Nations efforts to implement the peace plan  such a request will meet with positive consideration.Notwithstanding our deep concern over recent violence  South Africa offers a ray of hope. Here we find two courageous leaders who have decided to bury the hatchet and endeavour to build a common future. The road ahead is full of obstacles. After 40 years of apartheid  its pillars still basically stand upright  but apartheid is to be dismantled. These leaders have to tear down the walls of distrust and bring the various groups in South Africa into the constitutional dialogue. They have to write a new language - one of conciliation and mutual respect - in a country which is used to the language of hatred and the practice of violence. They have to open up perspectives for peaceful change in a society split apart by deep divisions between the haves and the have-nots. In other words  their task is of Herculean proportions. And yet there is reason for hope as both parties combine goodwill with good sense. After years of vigorous support of the anti-apartheid struggle  the international community is now under an obligation to support the actual constructive forces of change in South Africa. We feel that a policy of encouraging the peaceful transition to a democratic South Africa in which all citizens enjoy equal rights is fully justified. Therefore  tangible progress on the road towards a complete dismantling of apartheid should  in our view  go hand in hand with a corresponding relaxation of economic pressures on South Africa.Let us not forget Korea. In that country a start has been made on unfreezing the situation between North and South. While waiting for a further improvement of the relations between North and South Korea  we call for adequate representation of the Korean people in the United Nations.Popular demand for democracy and the craving for human rights are growing stronger year after year. The human rights debate should not be permeated by a North-South divide. From Latin America to East Asia and from Eastern Europe to Africa  people cry out for freedom  underlining time and again that human rights are truly universal values.As we welcome the end of the cold war  we also welcome a new perspective for the United Nations in the field of human rights. United Nations human rights standards have always provided clear and uncompromising criteria by which the conduct and achievement of Governments could be measured. Now a sustained effort can be made to strengthen the supervisory machinery which is so important if respect for human rights is really to be improved. In the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) mechanisms have been established which  more than the United Nations body of norms  provide States with specific detailed procedures to hold each other accountable for violations of human rights. The same may be true for the new norms which have been developed in the CSCB for compliance with the requisites of free elections and the rule of law. Here  as elsewhere  regional and United Nations systems should reinforce each other.No political order will last very long if it does not permit change. In fact  the United Nations concept of world order has always been a combination of collective security and peaceful change. Concentrating on restoring the peace in the Gulf or elsewhere  however necessary and justified  is not enough. We must at the same time continue to put our energy into combating poverty  disease  illiteracy  drugs and terrorism  into promoting equitable economic development both domestically and internationally. The recent eighteenth special session of this Assembly  on international economic co-operation  has put the world back on the right track in its dialogue on development problems  after long years of fruitless polarisation. The Assembly's Declaration represents a fitting start for the formulation and implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Fourth Development Decade.The Gulf crisis now seriously clouds the economic perspectives. Rising energy prices will severely impair development  particularly in third-world countries. Growth figures  debt-service ratios and adjustment programmes will have to be adapted to more pessimistic indicators. There is reason for concern about the possible implications for the multilateral trade negotiations in the Uruguay Sound. It is up to all of us to find a means of safeguarding the developing countries  and especially the least developed countries  from severe setbacks in their economic and social progress. The Netherlands has recently taken the initiative to propose a collective cancellation of official bilateral debt to severely indebted poorest countries which implement sound economic policies.Just as it is difficult to imagine safeguarding international peace without at the same time striving to promote social peace  it is equally difficult to imagine that either can survive in the long run without an ecological balance - in short  green peace. Life on Earth for future generations could very well be endangered if man does not make peace with nature. And if not peace  then at least a cease-fire. The threats are real enough warming of the atmosphere  depletion of the ozone layer  acid rain  expanding deserts and reckless deforestation - to pick just a few from a growing list. It is indeed must urgent that we act  if only to stop further deterioration. We simply cannot afford the luxury of waiting for irrefutable scientific proof as to what precisely causes the different problems confronting us. We should not allow ourselves the benefit of the doubt. It is crucial now to move towards the early conclusion of a world climate convention which should put an effective stop to such related phenomena as ""arming of the atmosphere  depiction of the ozone layer and deforestation. We are happy to observe that the recent London Conference reached agreement on the total banning of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000.Our endeavours to protect the atmosphere  and indeed the environment as a whole  can only be successful with the full participation of the developing countries. The industrialised countries have an obligation to help their already overburdened nations by providing  among others  facilitating funds. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in 1992  should set the seal on world-wide agreements on concrete measures for the protection of the environment and the restoration of the damage already inflicted  while taking account of the special position of the developing countries. The Netherlands will continue to play an active role in its preparation. In this contest  I should like to mention a high-level meeting on human settlements and sustainable development in November  which will be hosted by my country.Both the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and the negotiations on new conventions  such as a world climate convention  serve as an opportunity to vest the United Nations with new crisis management and enforcement and powers ensuring compliance with environmental standards. We should seize these opportunities in an adequate manner. After all  conditions of life on Earth  and therewith the world's security  are at stake.In conclusion  the Gulf crisis has once again made the world aware of the great value of a properly functioning United Nations. We sincerely hope that  after long years of stagnation  the United Nations will be able to enhance its role in the enforcement of collective security and the promotion of peaceful change. The United Nations should also seize upon the present opportunity to resume the work on the reform and the creating of a joint organization which has begun in the last few years.  The Netherlands has traditionally been an ardent supporter of the Organisation. We will do our share of the wor2c involved in strengthening this world Organisation and equally in strengthening international 1ш in all its dimensions  including promotion of a later recourse to the International Court of Justice  as recommended by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organisation.""With all its imperfections the United Nations Organisation offers the peace-loving nations of the world now a fully workable mechanism which will give them peace  if they want peace. To be sure  no piece of social machinery  however well constructed  can be effective unless there is  back of it  a will and determination to make it work.""Those words of one of the fathers of the United Nations were true in 1945 and are no less valid in 1990.Let us make it work."
"108",5236,"NOR",45,1990,"﻿It is indeed a pleasure to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to your high office at such an important period in the history of the Organization.As we proceed into the last decade of the millennium the recognition of one fundamental fact will penetrate and influence all spheres of human life: distance  measured in kilometres or miles  has lost its importance. The world is one. The challenges of our time require concerted policies and common action.The instruments with which to formulate such policies and to implement such action are emerging. But the expanding rift between rich and poor contradicts the growing interdependence of our global community. Modern technology is bringing us closer year by year  but in living conditions we are drifting apart. The concluding years of this century must be marked by decisive action to create the instruments we need and to reverse negative trends.There is one fundamental pre-condition for progress: we must proceed on the basis of respect for human rights and international law. Therefore  we must condemn Iraq's brutal attack on and occupation of Kuwait. Iraq's aggression is unacceptable. And it is more: it is a threat to our civilization and to the stability of all of us. The Iraqi leadership hears the sole and complete responsibility for the dramatic situation that has been created. We must insist that law  and not brute power  prevail in international relations. There is no alternative. Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait. The legitimate Government of Kuwait must be restored. All hostages and foreigners must be allowed to leave Kuwait and Iraq. We support the resolute words of Presidents Bush and Gorbachev:""Nothing short of the complete implementation of the United Nations SecurityCouncil resolutions is acceptable.""Norway is participating fully in the international effort to implement the United Nations sanctions effectively. We shall continue to do so until justice has been restored. That will require firmness and patience from all of us. It will require a sharing of responsibilities to ensure the efficient implementation of the embargo  to alleviate the enormous human suffering and to reduce the economic difficulties that - for many countries ~ have been added to already pressing problems.At its forty-fifth session  the General Assembly must and will assume its responsibility for the achievement of a peaceful solution in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council. The Norwegian Government gives its support to the efforts of the Security Council  as we supported its decision on Tuesday to ensure an effective air embargo. At this crucial hour the world must stand united. United we stand; divided we fall. So we must use every opportunity to press for a peaceful solution on the basis of the Security Council resolutions. We cannot negotiate about fundamental principles of international law on which a peaceful world order must be built. On the day we agree to negotiate about such principles we shall all have lost. If we fail  we shall all be responsible for the consequences. We shall all have to face them  not only in this particular conflict but in terms of a more fragile world. With the cold war behind us we have an unprecedented chance to build a new and more co-operative world order. By whatever we now choose to do we shall send important signals that will shape our future. If we stand firm  other aggressors will hesitate. If we yield  the threshold for new acts of aggression will be lowered.The decisiveness of the Security Council represents a turning point in the history of the United Nations  demonstrating the will of the world community to revive the principles of collective security. The United Nations has been brought closer to what was originally envisaged in the Charter. That is an encouraging development  but the progress we have made is fragile. If we stay the course in this present conflict  then we shall have taken a giant and decisive leap forward.We must also look beyond the present crises. The United Nations needs a stronger capacity to intervene. We need a thorough discussion on how to refine and develop the ability of the United Nations to secure international peace and stability  λ number of issues will be addressed. We must further enhance the role of the Security Council; we must create more efficient United Nations mechanisms  and not only for solving but for preventing conflicts; we must make maximum use of the good offices of the Secretary-General.Allow me in this connection to express the admiration of my Government for the tireless efforts the Secretary-General has undertaken in a number of conflict areas. Those efforts have contributed greatly to the strengthening of the role and prestige of the United Nations. Norway is among the traditional contributors of troops to peace-keeping operations. The potential of these operations  combined with diplomatic peace-making efforts and preventive diplomacy  must be further developed. We must also look more closely at the possibility of deploying the blue helmets in support of humanitarian relief operations in war-torn areas. A group of experts of the Nordic countries will now meet to examine ways to strengthen the peace-making role of the United Nations. Furthermore  the Soviet proposal for a standing international military force under United Nations control to deter future acts of aggression is also a valuable contribution to this debate.Maintaining a broadly based consensus within the Security Council is  of course  a fundamental prerequisite for success. In its deliberations on the Iraq-Kuwait conflict  the Security Council has succeeded eminently in forging the necessary consensus and solidarity. The new era of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union has given the Organization new strength. To build this new climate of trust has required boldness and political courage by the leaders of both countries. Their efforts have our strong support. The possibilities of the United Nations to play a truly constructive role in world affairs have increased. But the necessary financial foundation is still lacking. In his annual report  the Secretary-General points to the glaring gap between the expectations now placed in the United Nations and the resources put at its disposal. I urge those countries which are in arrears to the United Nations and to the special accounts for peace-keeping operations to pay their debt in full as soon as possible.The process which led to independence for Namibia is among the most outstanding successes of the United Nations. I am indeed pleased to see Namibia finally taking its rightful place in this Hall. In the rest of southern Africa we have also witnessed historic developments during the past year. We welcome the political process that has been set in motion by the South African Government and by the African National Congress (ANC). The agreement of 6 August is a milestone on the road towards a new democratic and non-racial South Africa.President De Klerk and Nelson Mandela are displaying remarkable courage and foresight. The road on which they have embarked is difficult. But they must persevere. They must succeed in their search for a peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy. As soon as such profound and irreversible changes have taken place  we will respond positively and quickly and remove the international pressure  including existing sanctions.Recent developments in Cambodia also give reason for hope. We welcome the establishment of a Supreme National Council and the agreement on a transitional arrangement until free and fair elections can be held. The agreements reached envisage an unprecedented role for the United Nations In this transitional period. This is imperative. The Cambodian people needs concrete guarantees that the inhuman policies of the Khmer Rouge will not again engulf Cambodia in suffering and tragedy.The Iraqi aggression against Kuwait has completely overshadowed and harmed the efforts to achieve a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question. It is now essential to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and to arrive at a just comprehensive and lasting solution to this conflict.The winds of revolutionary change have swept over Eastern Europe. At last these countries and their citizens are free to decide on their own future. The continent is moving from the post-war era of containment to an era of co-operation. What has been achieved in an amazingly short time by the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe deserves our admiration and respect. So does the foresight of the Soviet leaders who decided to stand aside and enable the peoples of the region to realize their yearning for freedom and democracy.The process of German unification has been carried out with tremendous political courage and in full respect for the legitimate interests of others. We congratulate the two Governments and the German people on this historic achievement. Chancellor Kohl - and Foreign Minister Genscher in his statement yesterday - have emphasized their determination to build a European Germany and not a German Europe. We wish them success in this endeavour.Hence  Europe is becoming whole and free. Through the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and on the basis of institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the European Community  the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the Council of Europe  the nations of the continent are creating new structures of co-operation. The CSCE is uniquely suited to play a leading role in that endeavour. It must be transformed from a political process to an institutional framework.The new era in East-West relations has created historic opportunities for disarmament and arms control. Prospects of an early treaty arising from the strategic arms reduction talks (START) providing for deep reductions in United States and Soviet strategic nuclear arms are promising. In Vienna  an agreement on conventional forces in Europe is within reach.The historic changes in Europe tell us to be ambitious also in attacking the global issues  such as the elimination of chemical weapons and the prevention of nuclear proliferation.The Gulf conflict demonstrates the urgency of putting the achievement of a global chemical weapons ban at the very top of our agenda. The chemical weapons threat must be eradicated once and for all. Intensified efforts are required. In the field of nuclear non-proliferation  progress has already been achieved in the domain of nuclear-arms control. Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is being implemented. This should now pave the way for renewed efforts to prevent the emergence of additional nuclear-weapon States. A comprehensive test-ban treaty will  in our opinion  be an essential element in this respect. In Europe  we have overcome the division of the continent. Political  economic and human resources  which for decades were absorbed in an unproductive East-West stalemate  can now be released for new and creative efforts. There will still be numerous problems to solve. But Europe cannot and will not become more occupied with its own affairs and less with its global responsibilities. On the contrary  the new Europe which is now emerging will have an even greater responsibility for meeting the global challenges than a divided continent could ever assume.The creation of democratic and pluralistic societies has always been an important objective in the development policy of my country. The world-wide discussion which has emerged on issues of democracy  freedom of opinion  participation in decision-making  political pluralism and free elections is remarkable. It reflects the growing recognition of one basic fact: that in the long run  no government will retain its legitimacy unless it is a government by the people and for the people.In several developing countries one-party systems are being questioned. I urge those countries to take the step from reflection to action by implementing rapid political and legal reforms. Initiatives in this direction will be given moral  political and economic support.Democracy  human rights and sustainable development are inseparable. This has become increasingly evident. Economic efficiency and equitable distribution cannot be achieved if the rights and the potential of the individual are neglected. Norway will attach increasing importance to the dialogue with our development partners on issues of democratic development  respect for human rights and popular participation in the development process. Decisive steps towards democracy and respect for human rights are the best guarantee for continued and broad popular support in the industrialized countries for development co-operation. Lack of progress could  on the other hand  negatively affect the willingness of donors to provide resources and support.We all gain from a more comprehensive dialogue on these crucial issues. Let us always keep in mind that the building of democracy is a never-ending process. The final stone is never put in place.The changes in East-West relations have also been accompanied by a narrowing of ideological differences in the economic field. Market-oriented policies have conquered the world. But the market is no end in itself. It is merely a means - the best means found so far - to achieve the most efficient allocation of productive resources. Helmut Schmidt once said; ""Markets are like parachutes - they only function when open."" But markets must also be monitored to ensure that they function effectively. They must be adjusted to achieve social justice. The German expression Soziale Marktwirtschaft - a social market economy - embraces all these dimensions.No international economic environment  however positive  will alone be sufficient to obtain satisfactory results. Sound and efficient policies and determined efforts by the Government and by the people of each country to carry out reforms is a prerequisite for growth. This is about to be recognized. It was clearly visible at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  in April. The work on the new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade offers an opportunity to go farther in this direction. The new strategy must emphasize the importance of the human factor in development. No longer-term economic development is possible without a healthy  well-educated population; without a population that enjoys full civil and political rights  and without an environment which can mobilize each individual's potential and creativity.Earlier this month agreement was reached on a comprehensive Programme of Action for the least developed countries. It builds on the fundamental principles of shared responsibility and on a strengthened partnership for the development of these countries. The international community cannot allow a further marginalization of the least developed countries. It is of fundamental importance to the success of this programme that its many concrete measures be fully implemented. We would have wished to see more far-reaching commitments on the part of the international community - not least with regard to targets for concessional aid flows. Nevertheless  the new programme will give fresh impetus to the social and economic development in the least developed countries.But the debt problem remains acute. New and vigorous efforts to improve the debt strategy are required. This means increased resource transfers  more comprehensive debt reductions and more ambitious reform policies. In particular  the plight of severely indebted low-income countries calls for urgent action. The Norwegian Government has submitted proposals to Parliament which will provide some low-income countries debt reductions considerably beyond the Toronto terms of the Paris Club.An urgent task in the environmental field is the achievement of more efficient decision-making procedures. To achieve an acceptable level of ecological security we shall need strengthened supranational institutions with decision-making powers confined with effective means for supervision  monitoring and control. The United Nations must be the cornerstone of such a system.In the European and North American context  Norway is advocating that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) must be used to mobilise Governments in concerted action to combat environmental degradation. It will have to do so in close co-operation with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ЕСЕ) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).In the Bergen Declaration of May this year  Ministers set a new green agenda for the 1990s for the ЕСЕ region. The decision to base national and international policies on the precautionary principle is an important achievement. So is the agreement that the industrialized countries should take the lead in solving global environmental problems. Developing countries must be assisted by the financial resources and technology transfer enabling them to join the struggle. New ways of providing such additional resources must be identified.Solidarity with developing countries through financial assistance must be a major issue - and result - of the process leading up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992. Our common strategies must aim at integrating environmental concerns into the economic and social development process in all countries.I urge the General Assembly to decide at this session - as a matter of the highest priority - on launching the negotiations on a framework convention on climate change. Such a convention must be ready for adoption at the 1992 Conference. Climate change is a truly global problem. It concerns all of us.The world is experiencing a welcome revival of multilateralism. As the idea of collective management of our present challenges takes hold  we are faced with the need to strengthen the capabilities of international organisations. That will be the crucial teat. Narrowly defined national interests will certainly emerge as stumbling blocks. We must learn to adopt a long-term view for the common good; learn to accept majority decisions of operational significance for the management of the global challenges; learn to express our national interests in terms of firm commitments to the advancement of a common purpose.The United Nations will have to carry a major part of that burden - to build awareness  to increase our knowledge  to formulate our common policies and to implement our common action. The Norwegian Government will participate fully  provide its contribution and give its firmest support."
"109",5282,"NPL",45,1990,"﻿Allow me at the outset to convey to you  Sir  my delegation's sincere felicitations on your unanimous election as President of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Our satisfaction at your election is even greater as Nepal shares with the friendly Government and people of Malta a deep and abiding commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and to the policy of non-alignment. Your wide experience as a political leader and your knowledge of multilateral diplomacy will no doubt provide you with the particular sensitivity and skill to guide us through the complex issues on the agenda of the General Assembly. My delegation pledges its full co-operation to you.Nepal welcomes the admission of the Principality of Liechtenstein as a Member of the Organisation  an event that has moved us even closer to the goal of universal membership of the United Nations. We look forward to working in close co-operation with the delegation of this friendly country  which represents one of the most successful combinations of democracy  human rights and economic prosperity.I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my delegation's appreciation to Mr. Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria for the admirable manner in which he guided the work of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.The past 12 months have been a busy period for the United Nations. There is today a renewal of faith in the Organization as an irreplaceable instrument in promoting international peace and co-operation. Much of this welcome resurgence is the result of the diplomatic skill and efforts of the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. He deserves our gratitude and full support.The year has been marked by events extraordinary in sweep and importance. Almost a half century ago the peoples of the United Nations through its Charter reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. For the majority of the peoples around the world  this vision was little more than a dream. Symptoms of positive changes in international relations  accompanied by a new and legitimate assertion of peoples  rights  became evident beginning with the middle of the decade of the 1980s. That the momentum towards the vision of freedom and dignity outlined in the Charter would gather the strength of a massive tidal wave  were beyond anyone's imagination only 12 months ago. This spontaneous wave has awakened people to assert their fundamental rights and freedom not only in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but also in many parts of Asia and Africa  including my own county  Nepal. The movement for the restoration of multiparty democracy in Nepal  which started only days after the first breach in the Berlin Wall  has ushered in a new political era in our country. The interim Government  representing major political parties  is now engaged in the task of consolidating democracy. The Prime Minister himself would have liked to come and acquaint the Assembly with the recent political changes in the country. However  that was not possible at this stage owing to the consultations he is undertaking on the draft of a new Constitution that is soon to be promulgated. The new Constitution  reflecting the democratic aspirations of the Nepalese people  will institutionalize a constitutional monarchy and a multiparty system and adhere to the values of people's sovereignty and accountable government. The Constitution will also guarantee the inviolability of fundamental rights and freedom  in keeping with the Universal Declaration of Human Sights  other covenants and the principle of the supremacy of law. General elections held on the basis of universal adult suffrage scheduled for the first of 1991 will strengthen political stability and freedom. The people of Nepal are proud to be part of the global movement towards democracy and freedom; the people of Nepal arc grateful for the understanding and support they have received from people around the world. Having set ourselves the irreversible goal of democracy and pluralism  we now look forward to meaningful co-operation and assistance from friendly countries and multilateral institutions in the daunting task of economic and social development.Nepal most heartily welcomes the creation of a more relaxed international climate  characterised by the big-Power détente. The most concrete symbol of revolutionary change in the political atmosphere is the reunification of Germany. I take this opportunity to extend the most cordial welcome to the delegation of the united Germany to this family of nations.The euphoria over the end of the cold war and the hopes for a more stable and democratic world order have  however  been dampened by the present situation in the Persian Gulf region. The aggression against Kuwait  a sovereign and independent State and a Member of this Organisation  is a rude reminder that the agreement of the two major Powers to settle their conflicts is a necessary but insufficient condition for the maintenance of international peace  security and stability. The aggression is an open violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It has also caused immense sufferings and dislocations to nationals of third countries  including Nepal  residing and working there. The aggression has evoked a swift and unprecedented response from the Security Council. The series of resolutions the Council has adopted demanding unconditional compliance with the rule of law in inter-State relations has ushered in a new phase in the application of the authority of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.The five permanent members of the Security Council bear a special responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace. It is true that there are and will be many more influential actors in world affairs. This will require consultations  co-ordination and compromise. The renewed interest in the international Organization and the willingness of the major Powers to use the mechanism of the Charter have the potential of restoring to the collective security system its original design. Nepal  therefore  welcomes the emergence of the unique convergence of views among the permanent members of the Security Council over the grave situation in the Persian Gulf region. We earnestly hope that this unity of the United Nations will he the rule rather than an exception. My delegation also agrees with the view expressed by the Secretary-General that agreement among the major or Powers must carry with it the support of the international community to counter any legitimate anxiety that world affaire may be run by a directorate.As the international community prepares for a new millennium  we are witnessing a rapid curtailing of many comfortable assumptions of yesteryear. At the sane tine  it is heartening to note that schisms which characterised the post - Second-World-War era are also being rapidly bridged. These positive changes have enhanced the capacity of the United Nations to work for a peaceful settlement of various outstanding bilateral and regional conflicts.The peaceful transition of Namibia to independence is an outstanding example of what this Organisation could achieve  given the support and co-operation of its Members. The potentials of peace-keeping and peace-making operations of the United Nations have also been evident elsewhere  especially in Central America. We welcome the recent agreement between Iran and Iraq to settle their disputes in keeping with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). While the situation in Lebanon continues to be alarming  admirable services are being rendered by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  to which Nepal is a contributor. Implementation of the Taif formula  fully supported by the United Nations  has held out promise of an end to the tragic fratricide in that country. The situation in the Middle East continues to be explosive with the stalling of all efforts to promote a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. My delegation feels that the opportunity created by a new climate of international relations must be used for a collective and concerted effort for the resolution of the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). As in the case of the Middle East  the spirit of conciliation among the major Powers offers hope for a settlement of the situation in Afghanistan. This spirit of conciliation has already raised the expectation that a solution of the problem of Cambodia with the active involvement of the United Nations may be within sight. Elsewhere in Asia  we welcome the unification of Yemen. My delegation is looking forward to the day  and we hope it is sooner rather than later  when the Korean people will be reunited through their own peaceful efforts. We have long respected their aspirations for reunification and welcome the continuing high-level negotiations between the two sides. Each side has been exercising all the attributes of sovereignty  and they will doubtless settle between them in the course of negotiations the question of membership of the United Nations. My delegation understands and will fully respect the wish of each side in the matter. In South Africa  the universally condemned system of apartheid is still in place. While we are encouraged by some recent developments  we believe that concerted efforts and pressure will have to be maintained to make the process irreversible and comprehensive with the establishment of a multiracial democratic society in South Africa. We share the disappointment of the Secretary-General at the lack of progress towards an overall solution in Cyprus and continue to support the use of his good offices for the restoration of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned character ofThe growing consensus on the need to wage a concerted war against drugs and terrorism is indicative of the new climate in international relative  in which nations are willing to work together for the general well-being of the people. The programme of action adopted at the seventeenth special session provides a useful framework for combating the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking  which threaten to tear the very fabric of civilised society apart.Looking to the future  there are some imperatives which need to be taken into consideration by the Governments if we are to ensure peace and justice  human freedom and dignity. The United Nations provides an indispensable instrument for the co-ordination and harmonization of actions in these areas.The first of these imperatives is that of arresting and reversing the arms race. Recognition by two of the world's most powerful States of the fact that the arms race has reached an absurd limit beyond all legitimate needs of national security has opened a new era of hope for disarmament. The perceptible improvement in international relations must be utilised to press for the extension of disarmament efforts beyond the nuclear and conventional arsenals of the great Powers and their alliances. Disarmament  to be meaningful  has to be the joint endeavour of all nations.The second immediate challenge before the world community is that of the increasing economic difficulties  especially in the developing countries. It has become imperative to act urgently in three spheres] debt  trade and commodities  and human resources development. At the special session on international economic co-operation the General Assembly made a serious evaluation of the current problems and the steps needed to address them. The strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  expected to be adopted at the current session of the General Assembly  should be a coherent and realistic programme reflecting the development imperatives in the decade of the 1990s.The vagaries of the international economic situation have hit the least-developed countries the hardest. Those countries face the most acute problems and are being increasingly marginalised in the world economy. The adoption at the Paris Conference of a programme of action designed to speed the growth and development of the least-developed countries is a milestone and we expect full and expeditious implementation of the plan. In this connection  we welcome the announcement by Kuwait that it would write off all interest on its loans to the least developed countries and consider with them arrangements with regard to the principal  with a view to easing the debt burden of the least developed countries.The third imperative is the need to halt and reverse the alarming degradation and destruction of our environment. The challenge is to preserve and protect our environment for generations to come without sacrificing the development imperatives of the developing countries. The global debate and activities on this question augur well for the adoption of environmentally sound development strategies at the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development.The fourth challenge is to adjust to international law and to honour the obligations that flow from the Charter. Only a legal order that encompasses the entire community of nations can provide the framework for effective multilateral co-operation. It is in the interest of all nations  large and small  to work for and within a coherent and viable system of law  impartially administered and imposed. In the final analysis  the rule of law alone will guarantee peace and stability for all.The fifth imperative is to secure universal respect for human rights. The principal purpose of the United Nations - the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of economic social progress and better standards of life for all - is to give content and meaning to human dignity. As long as a government violates the universally accepted norms of human rights  as long as people are brutalised and oppressed on the basis of sex or race or because of their opinions or beliefs  the international community cannot claim to have conquered the brutalities that have darkened human history. The United Nations presents the only forum for a co-ordinated effort to ensure that human rights and fundamental freedoms are fully observed.The unprecedented attendance at the recent World Summit for Children highlighted the need to take special actions in favour of children  who constitute the most vulnerable sector of our society. The Declaration adopted by the Summit should prove to be a powerful incentive to put the children first - to give every child a better future. The Summit has also provided a strong incentive for the speedy accession to  and ratification of  the Convention on the Sights of the Child  making it a truly universal instrument. The beginning of the decade of the 1990s has ushered in hopeful signs of growing mutual confidence and good faith. This is essential for the movement from an age of fear  doubt  anxiety and deprivation for an overwhelming majority to a new era of interdependence and co-operation  to a more generous period of statesmanship  an era of freedom and dignity for all. Today  there is also an increasing willingness on the part of Member States to use the existing international mechanism to its full potential. This is essential to ensure the safe and dignified passage of humanity to the next millennium."
"110",5346,"NZL",45,1990,"﻿I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency at a time when the Organization stands at the threshold of opportunity and faces complex challenges. What is true for the Organization is true  too  for my country. In New Zealand 1990 marks 150 years since the foundations of our nation State were laid.The basic compact  the Treaty of Waitangi  was signed in 1840 by the tribal chiefs of the country they referred to as Aotearoa  and by representatives of the British Crown on behalf of the new settlers in the country they called New Zealand. It was an agreement to live and work in co-operation. There are still significant challenges to our partnership - to honour broken promises and to redress historical wrongs. We are working for a society where ethnic and cultural differences are valued as strengths rather than rejected as weaknesses. We are trying to put our house in order.The end of the cold war presents the United Nations with the opportunity in 1990 to put the global house in order  to make a fresh and reinvigorated commitment to the world's security. The Secretary-General reminded us in his annual report that a comprehensive approach to security is the very essence of the existence of the United Nations. New Zealand vigorously endorses that view  λ balanced and integrative approach to security - acknowledgement of our common security needs and of the role of the Unite Nations - is central to the protection of the interests of small countries. We believe that small countries have much to offer the United Nations. Many of the world's citizens live in small countries which have modest aspirations  which do not wish to engage in wars  and which cannot force their views on others. Indeed  the major security threats to our country and its immediate region  the islands of the South Pacific  are not military but rather environmental and economic.New Zealand and the rest of the South Pacific are fortunate in that we are removed from areas of conflict or significant international tension. But we are by no means isolated. Global  economic  political and environmental developments can often impact sharply on small countries which are distant from the epicentre of world events  a commitment to the common security needs of the global community is important at a time like this when we all face the crisis in the Persian Gulf.New Zealand has unreservedly condemned Iraq's aggression against a small neighbour and the repugnant actions taken against foreign nationals. The people most affected  of course  are the Kuwaitis themselves  who are suffering from an attempt by an aggressive neighbour to extinguish their country's independent existence. However  also experiencing immediate anguish are the many thousands of foreign nationals caught up in the crisis  especially those detained against their will. There are only a handful of New Zealanders amongst them  but the small number does not diminish the significance of their plight for the Government and people of New Zealand. We consider the continued holding of hostages to be an outrage and we urge Iraq to release all those detained and to respect immediately all the resolutions of the Security Council.  Of course  a fundamental concern remains the dreadful possibility of a war that could escalate rapidly to encompass many countries and perhaps spread to other regions. The whole world has an interest in ensuring that does not occur and that a resort to armed conflict is avoided.In that process  respect for the principles and values of the United Nations - and the use of its mechanisms by all of us - is essential. New Zealand indicated at an early stage to the United Nations Secretariat its readiness to contribute to any operations in the Gulf region under United Nations auspices. I confirm that offer today. In particular  New Zealand has demonstrated willingness and ability to contribute to United Nations peace-keeping operations. We have committed ourselves to the supply of food and medical assistance  and our aircraft have ferried some of the refugees from the area back to their home countries - Pakistan and the Philippines in particular. The Gulf crisis has illustrated vividly the potential for the United Nations to provide a swift  effective response to regional conflict. The achievement to date has been considerable.This is the first opportunity for New Zealand to state its view of the Gulf crisis in the framework of the Organization  and I would like to add a cautionary note to what other speakers have said. We all understand the implications of a further escalation of the Gulf crisis. Against that background  it is vital that the support of all United Nations Members be sustained for collective responses. Care must be taken never to presume too much. It is after all the United Nations Members as a whole who  in Article 24: ""confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security"". That act of conferral underpins all else. The actions in the past weeks in the Security Council in regard to that whole issue have truly historical significance. They establish precedents for practical responses to other and different regional conflicts or disputes. All of us - Security Council permanent members  non-permanent members  and non-Security Council members - are  I think  sufficiently clear about the importance of what is currently being achieved.But we need to give more thought to how that process is undertaken. As a first step  there is room for improving among us all  and  irrespective of our place in the scheme of things  the sharing of information  perceptions and conclusions about how United Nations responses should best be formulated. Such a process is going to be indispensable in the longer run to achieving our shared purpose  big country and small  within the Organization. Our collective response to the present threats to global stability depends on a background of substantial achievement at and since the last session of the General Assembly.The independence of Namibia  the signs of political progress in South Africa  the constructive steps towards a settlement in the Western Sahara  and the progress towards resolution of the situation in Cambodia together comprise a significant list of achievements. The gathering consensus among the five permanent members of the Security Council  and the new spirit that animates the relations between the super-Powers  are great achievements. But it is the tasks which remain that will provide the real test of the United Nation’s capabilities and of what the future will hold for us all.That brings me back once again to common security. At a time when there has been so much hope expressed - and yet we still face such daunting problems - there is a need for increased commitment to strengthening the threads of our common security. Many hope that we are now witnessing the emergence of a new order. It is certainly time for it. But to achieve it we Must put away the old ways of thinking  the old ways of acting. We need a change of attitude towards what constitutes security. We need s new respect for our rapidly diminishing natural resources. We need an acknowledgment that human rights and freedoms depend not only on resolutions passed at international meetings  but on the implementation of decisions that will facilitate real economic choices for countries.For many nations  particularly those of the South  the problems of trade  indebtedness and economic underdevelopment are enduring. Unless there are greater moves towards the liberalization of trade  there will be no real progress. In the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations is nearing the deadline for its completion. New Zealand is pinning its hopes on its success. The prospects of new trade opportunities for all cannot be overrated.This represents a last chance for GATT. In 40 years  the system has failed to produce an equitable trading environment for the majority of its members. In the area of agricultural trade  which is of principal concern to my country  GATT has been a singular disappointment. It has condoned protectionism and subsidization  principally by the major economic Powers  which have over the years corroded economic opportunity and potential for commodity-trading countries.At a time when the idea of burden-sharing is gaining currency  we should reflect upon the fact that the burden of protectionism in several major industrialized economies has been carried by other countries. It is even more instructive to reflect that agricultural support and subsidization inside the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was estimated for 1989 at $245 billion - six times the total of resources transferred by those countries to developing countries in that same year. The GATT outcome in December is the litmus test. The principal adjustments in that trade round will have to come from those more powerful economies whose influence has shaped  or misshaped  the trade rules for nearly half a century. At this very moment  those self-same countries have in their grasp the opportunity to effectively manage regional political security in our world in better and more imaginative ways than have ever boon contemplated previously. Resource transfers are needed not only address the endemic problems of economic underdevelopment  but also to assist in the attack on what has been only toe recently acknowledged - environmental degradation.That is another	in which the interests of some countries are inextricably involved with the actions of others. It is an area where the embracing of the idea of common security is essential for survival. New Zealand's own immediate neighbours in the South Pacific provide ample demonstrations of that. Far from being a vast  uninhabited sea  the great South Pacific Ocean contains tens of thousands of islands  over 1 000 distinct languages  and a great variety of different cultures. But many of those are small islands  atoll countries whose very existence is threatened by the sea-level rise predictor it greenhouse gas emissions are not contained by industrialised countries.The ecosystem of our marine environment is also threatened from the outside by the wanton stripping of resources and the dumping of wastes. The environmental security of the South Pacific is totally interdependent with that of the wider Asia-Pacific region and the global community. To preserve our environmental security we must have sustained political commitment to making hard decisions.The United Nations has just begun preparations for the vitally important 1992 Conference on Environment and Development. New Zealand intends playing a full and constructive part  and our Government will be working with our non-governmental organizations to bring our country's perspective to the Conference. Assistance must be given to the developing countries  in particular to enable them to repair the environmental damage aggravated by poverty and to help them avoid reliance on environmentally destructive technologies. The General Assembly has a critical role in carrying forward the environmental debate  forming decisions upon which Governments can act.The achievement last year of a significant resolution on driftnet fishing and the actions which have followed it provide ample proof of what can be achieved. We need to build upon that. Urgent measures must be taken in a number of areas  particularly to prevent climate change and preserve the earth's biodiversity.Even though it has undoubtedly been triggered by a crisis situation  the increasing recognition of the need for international co-operation to preserve the environment is an encouraging sign of global support for new sorts of security policies. However  in the final analysis our common security also depends on maintaining and strengthening world peace. We all welcome the new opportunities offered by the end of the cold war. There has undoubtedly been major progress over the last year  in the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  the agreement in principle on reductions in strategic nuclear weapons and the negotiations on conventional stability in Europe. But the most remarkable symbol of the end of the cold war is of course that from this week onwards there will be only one German delegation at the United Nations. The peaceful reunification of the German nation is a momentous achievement. We support unreservedly the efforts of the two major Powers and other countries involved in those processes. We look to a world ruled by peace and stability rather than by military confrontation. But  while we look to the future with greater hope  we must also do so without illusions. The crisis in the Gulf region reminds us all too starkly that the maintenance of peace requires a real commitment. We cannot assume that peace will happen as the inevitable result of historical trends. All of us - great Powers and small - share a responsibility to ensure that new opportunities become significant achievements.Up till now the vigorous pursuit of conventional arms dealing has played a major part in the creation of conflicts. Governments cannot escape their responsibility to halt this proliferation. We in New Zealand are committed to playing a constructive and imaginative role in the disarmament process and in participating in achieving real security in our region and internationally.New Zealand's commitment to peace-keeping is reflected in our involvement in the Middle East in the United Nations truce supervision operation and in the Iran-Iraq observer group  as well as in the non-United Nations peace-keeping operation in the Sinai. New Zealand police assisted with the transition to independence in Namibia. In our own region  we recently provided facilities to help with the negotiation and reconciliation of the dispute over the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea.An important contribution made by the countries of our region to the global nuclear disarmament process has been the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone  endorsed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly last year. The Treaty complements the nuclear-free policies which New Zealand has adopted domestically. Two permanent members of the Security Council have given their formal commitment to this initiative by signing the relevant protocols of the Treaty. Two others have given assurances that their actions are not inconsistent with the Treaty's provisions. We urge all the nuclear-weapon States to make a formal commitment by signing the protocols to the Treaty.The establishment of a South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone has thrown into even sharper contrast the way France continues to test its nuclear weapons  in defiance of the wishes of the countries of the region. Our protests against testing by a nuclear Power in the South Pacific  outside its metropolitan territory  have been ignored. It is intolerable that a region which is com- .¿d to nuclear-free principles should be used as a test site for the development of nuclear-weapon technology. For a number of years New Zealand and Australia have sponsored draft resolutions in this Assembly calling for an end to the testing of all nuclear weapons. We shall be sponsoring such a draft resolution again this year.More than any other single measure  a comprehensive test ban would help slow down the nuclear arms race. We ask the permanent members of the Security Council to respond to the overwhelming demand of the Assembly for the early achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.We share the concern of many Members of the Organisation about the possible spread of nuclear weapons to areas of tension such as the Middle East  North Asia or the Korean peninsula. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a vital part of the process of global nuclear disarmament. In this contest  we welcomed the widespread support evident at the recent Review Conference for stronger safeguards to restrict further the possible spread of nuclear weapons. It was a matter of great regret to us that it was not possible to have these and other important gains made by the Review Conference formally adopted in a Final Document. It is imperative to take other follow-up action to ensure that those gains are not now lost. It is most frustrating that there has been so little progress on banning nuclear testing  which we see as an important part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty bargain. Nevertheless  the stakes are too high to place this Treaty at risk.One other aspect of disarmament that is currently the cause of considerable interest in our region is chemical weapons destruction. The decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to destroy most of their stocks of chemical weapons is welcome. Less welcome has been the United States decision to use an atoll in the Pacific Ocean for the destruction of some of its stocks. We certainly understand the need to destroy in site where possible and look forward to the day when existing stocks in our region are no more. But  along with other South Pacific countries  we are concerned that our region must not be viewed as a convenient disposal area far from the crowded cities of the countries which created the armaments. It is the clear view of our region that there should be no further transfer to the Pacific from outside of chemical weapon stocks for destruction. We have therefore welcomed the assurance to this end given to the South Pacific Forum by the United States. We shall continue to resist the idea of our region being used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons or for the dumping or disposal of nuclear or toxic waste. The threshold of challenge and of opportunity for the United Nations obliges us all to ensure that our Organisation is equal to new tasks. The system in many aspects reflects another world and another time. In 40 years new and significant players have become active in our world community of nations and their position in the scheme of things does need to be better acknowledged. Old enmities have subsided; divided countries are reuniting. The many smaller countries ponder how their interests are now best preserved in this scene of unprecedented change. It is necessary to have a system that better reflects a comprehensive view of our world's security  that allows clear decisions and  most importantly  that encourages faithful observance of agreed conventions. The General Assembly must strive for that  and we must all bear in mind the final beneficiaries of our actions - our children.At a time when the United Nations is drawing attention to the needs of the children of the world  it is worth reminding ourselves that it is neither the technology nor the resource that is missing in the search to integrate environmental and developmental needs  to create a commonwealth of security for the next generation. What is missing is the political will. We all know that the bizarre reality is that solutions to the real and compelling needs of children  which have been discussed here in the past few days  could be found by reducing the bloated arms budgets of the world.At this time of such great hope - and such great peril - perhaps we should also remember that those who will inherit our political bequests have simple needs. As we make decisions  choose to act or choose not to act  I would ask the question in the language of the Maori of Aotearoa  the language of my sons ""Ha aha te taonga o Te Ao Gon?"" - ""What is the treasure of the new dawn?"" And the answer is obvious: ""Nga mokopuna  nos mokopuna. ma mokopuna"" - ""It is the children  it is the children""."
"111",5391,"OMN",45,1990,"﻿It gives me pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your election to this high office is in recognition of your ability and your experience. We have every confidence that  under your direction  the General Assembly will consolidate the gains it made at its last session under the leadership of your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria. I should like also to convey the support of the Sultanate of Oman and the States member of the Gulf Co-operation Council  of which  this year  Oman is president  far the efforts of the Secretary-General in carrying out the tasks entrusted to him by this Organisation. We commend his endeavour to strengthen confidence in the effectiveness of the United Nations as a body capable of assuming a positive and effective role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in defending the inviolability of the enlightened principles and standards of this community of nations.On behalf of my country's delegation  I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome the admission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to membership of the United Nations.Even when the credibility of the United Nations was most widely doubted  my country declared its faith in the effective role that the Organisation could play  given a readiness to be bound by its purposes and principles. We would like to reiterate that the foreign policy of the Sultanate of Oman  as laid down by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said  is constantly guided by the high purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and remains committed to the international and regional treaties to which the country has acceded. Among the most important components of our policy as prescribed by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos since our modern resurgence began on 23 July 1970  the 20th anniversary of which we are celebrate this year  have been the strengthening of bonds of friendship with all other States without distinction and the maintenance of relations with them that are built on a foundation of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  and the settlement of disputes between States through dialogue and by peaceful means. Those are the principles by which we are guided in our relations with our neighbours and every other State with which the Sultanate of Oman maintains relations and links of co-operation.In the course of this year  the international community has witnessed important developments that have led to the emergence of the first genuine detente of its kind since the end of the Second World War between the two camps of East and Hest. That détente has had helpful consequences for many international and regional issues  and we are hopeful that its positive results will also of necessity reinforce the role of the United Nations  and enable it to adopt practical measures for the implementation of its resolution and the achievement of its goals  in particular those relating to the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of sound relations and co-operation among Member States.On 2 August this year  Iraq's armies invaded and occupied by force the sister State  Kuwait. The invasion and forcible annexation of a neighbouring State is a dangerous precedent the likes of which the international community has not witnessed since the establishment of the United Nations. The Organization was founded and the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter were adopted with the specific purpose in view of preventing such an occurrence. What Iraq has done constitutes a flagrant violation of all the principles of the Organization and is the sort of conduct that is inadmissible under international legitimacy.The Sultanate of Oman has strongly condemned the invasion and occupation  as have the Gulf Co-operation Council  the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the League of Arab States  the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  the Extraordinary Arab Summit Conference and the United Nations Security Council. We commend the decisive international stand that has emerged from Security Council resolutions 660 (1990)  661 (1990)  662 (1990)  664 (1990)  665 (1990)  666 (1990)  667 (1990) and 670 (1990).We also welcome the positive role played by the friendly and fraternal States in responding to the legitimate appeal made by Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the grounds of self-defence. There can be no doubt that that response is an expression of the readiness of the international community to preserve peace and to defend the legitimate interests of States  particularly small ones.We are grieved by Iraq's failure to comply with the resolutions of the League of Arab States  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and the United Nations Security Council calling for complete withdrawal from Kuwaiti territory and the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait. We hope that Iraq will comply with all the aforementioned resolutions so that the Iraqi people can once again enjoy the benefits of peace and stability  channel their enormous human and natural resources to the task of building and reconstruction  and resume their constructive role in the Arab world and in the family of nations.The current Gulf crisis has clearly shown that the Middle East region is one of an extremely sensitive character owing to the convergence of international interests there. The international community must therefore take decisive action to solve the political problems of the region  chief among which is the question of Palestine.We support all the international efforts which aim at a peaceful and just solution to the cause of the Palestinian people  and it is our view that resolving the problem will be in the interest of all parties concerned. The time has come for the Middle East region to enjoy a situation of stability and for all efforts in the region to be directed towards development.Israel's open occupation of parts of Lebanese territory is a primary and insurmountable obstacle to the restoration of that country's unity  security and stability. We reiterate our solidarity with Lebanon in its efforts to achieve national reconciliation and regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity.In Afghanistan  the horrors of war and bloodshed and the plight of the refugees persist  after more than two years since the signing of the Geneva Accords. We are confident that the two super-Powers  as guarantors of the Accords  will provide all necessary support and assistance to international efforts to form a national Government embracing all the factions of the Afghan people. Afghanistan will thus be able to preserve its neutrality and its Islamic identity  and the plight of the refugees will be brought to an end  allowing them to live in dignity in a homeland linked as it must be by relations of good-neighbourliness to all contiguous States  including the Soviet Union.After more than 20 years of division and relentless wars and disruptions  there are signs of a solution to the question of Cambodia on the horizon. The Sultanate of Oman welcomes the progress made in that connection  and in particular: the agreement reached by the five permanent members of the Security Council in the last week of August this year  which has been accepted by the coalition Government and all other parties. It hopes that concerted efforts will be made in the light of that agreement with a view to reaching a just and comprehensive settlement of the issue that will take account of the aspirations of the Cambodian people and its desire to choose for itself the system of Government that it deems appropriate.We had hoped that the optimism which has come to permeate international relations would play an important and decisive role with regard to preparations for the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean this year. While commending the position adopted by certain States of the Western Group that participated in the work of the Ad Hoe Committee on the Indian Ocean  my country calls upon other Western States to follow their example and to respond to the spirit of conciliation and flexibility shown by the States of the Indian Ocean area so that the Conference may be held as rescheduled with the participation of all States concerned. United Nations efforts which have led to the independence of Namibia were a splendid example of what this Organisation can achieve if concerted international efforts are made to solve regional problems. We welcome the admission of Namibia to the Organisation  and hope it will play the positive role expected of it in the search for peace and security throughout the region to which it belongs.The Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session  on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa  makes it clear that lasting peace and stability in the region can be achieved only with the dawning of a new era in which no one suffers under the yoke of apartheid. The Declaration  which was adopted by consensus  illustrates the fact that peace does not simply mean the absence of war  but that it also involves rejecting the denial of rights of any kind. Thus  while welcoming the reforms instituted by the Government of President De Klerk  my country wishes to make it clear that those reforms should not be seen as an end in themselves but only as a step towards the complete elimination of the racist regime.We hope also that efforts being made for the solution of the Angolan problem will be crowned with success so that peace and security can be achieved in that important part of the African continent.The situation in Cyprus continues to be characterised by a lack of movement  despite the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General. The Sultanate of Oman calls upon the two parties to exercise self-restraint and to pursue their dialogue in a spirit of conciliation  so that Cyprus may surmount its ordeal and so that the members of its two communities may once again live together  as before  in security  peace and concord.In Central America  the international community has begun to reap the harvest sown by the efforts made to achieve peace there. At the time  the Sultanate of Oman supported the Esquipulas and Tela agreements  and it can only support and view with satisfaction the efforts towards national reconciliation now under way  which herald the beginning of a new peace process to which the peoples of the region have so long aspired.The situation on the Korean peninsula continues to be a source of tension in East Asia. We hope the progress achieved thus far in the ongoing negotiations between the two States and in the contacts between the Governments of the Soviet Union and the Republic of Korea will establish a basis for understanding between the two countries. We shall support any international effort for the admission of the two Koreas as Members of the United Nations.Environmental issues such as climate change  hazardous-waste disposal  the depletion of the ozone layer and environmentally sound development have become the object of increasing world interest  as is clear from the results of the London conference on Saving the Ozone Layer  the Hague Declaration and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.Under the guidance of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said  my country was among the first to enact legislation and establish mechanisms for environmental protection and the conservation of nature both at the domestic and the regional levels. Oman is thus engaged at present in identifying chemical substances used in its various industries which might affect the ozone layer  with a view to bringing the use of such substances into line with the levels established by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Along with fellow members of the Gulf Co-operation Council  my country is also studying the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Additional Protocol with a view to acceding to them.Environmental pollution does not recognize political frontiers. While we concede the world-wide character of the ecological problem  it must nevertheless be acknowledged that all States are not equally responsible for it. The industrially advanced countries  as the major source of pollution  must bear a special responsibility for dealing with this serious threat. In that connection  my country is of the view that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Brazil in 1992  will afford the best opportunity for the international community to act in concert to discuss worsening environmental problems and to devise appropriate solutions taking account of current development needs without jeopardising the destiny of future generations.The international community's aspiration to a world safe from the nuclear threat will remain unfulfilled if States that possess nuclear weapons persist in retaining them. The positive developments in the field of disarmament produced by the recent Washington summit of the two super-Powers must therefore be but one step towards ridding the world of those overkill and other weapons of mass destruction.We appreciate the role played by the major Powers  particularly the United States of America and the Soviet Union  the responsibility they have taken upon themselves and the efforts they have made towards disarmament  but the United Nations must also play a significant role in this regard. The Organisation must address an issue that could pose a threat to the continued existence of mankind on this planet.The impact of the recent positive political developments in the international arena has yet to be reflected in international economic co-operation. The gap between the industrially advanced countries and the developing countries continues to widen. The causes of imbalances in the world economy and in trade have not been remedied. Average annual rates of real growth in the developing countries fell from 5.5 per cent in the 1970s to less than 3 per cent in the 19808. Terms of trade for most of those countries have deteriorated as a result of a fall in the prices of the basic commodities that are the mainstays of their exports. At the same time  many developing countries are suffering from problems of indebtedness  the burden of which continues to weigh heavily on their economies. In 1988 alone they lost some $50 billion in debt servicing and interest payments. The regrettable events in the Gulf have demonstrated that whenever complex political issues arise in the international arena the economic difficulties of the developing countries tend to be aggravated. There is a pressing need for the international community  and particularly the industrially advanced countries  to adopt positive initiatives - such as the Brady initiative - and to enact other measures in keeping with the scale of the problem until such time as the developing countries can reverse the net flow of financial resources and thereby establish the basis required for their development and the realisation of real growth.The deliberations of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  to the revitalisation of the economic growth and development of the developing countries  which was held here last April  as well as the deliberations of the Second United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries held at Paris in recent days have made it clear that the prevailing political climate might be most propitious for making a start on the elaboration of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade  one that would take into account  inter alia  the adoption of a new trade mechanism to help enhance the opportunities of access of exports from developing countries to the markets of industrially advanced countries.The United Nations and its institutions have made important achievements and  as a consequence  the confidence of the international community in the role of the Organization and its satisfaction with the performance of that role has increased. The United Nations will remain the indispensable refuge of all States  a refuge to which  guided by the purposes and principles of the Organisation and protected by its Charter in the maintenance of peace and security  they may have recourse to review their problems and differences and co-ordinate their efforts for a better future. "
"112",5437,"PAK",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  I have great pleasure in conveying to you cordial felicitations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your unanimous election is a befitting tribute to your qualities of statesmanship  as well as to your country  with which Pakistan maintains close and friendly relations.I should also like to convey through you to your predecessor Mr. Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria  our high esteem for the manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the forty-fourth session.May I take this opportunity to convey to the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our deep appreciation for his unwavering commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.It is also a privilege to welcome Liechtenstein as the newest Member of the United Nations.The world is witnessing the universal triumph of human values  the affirmation of freedom and of all those virtues that give meaning to life. A new international order is on the horizon. East-West rivalry is already a relic of the past. Co-operation and understanding are the order of the day. With the changes in Eastern Europe  the imminent reunification of Germany  and the progressive integration in other parts of Europe  that entire continent stands at the threshold of another renaissance.A pervasive spirit of change is sweeping the globe. Protracted and festering regional disputes in distant and disparate lands are moving towards settlement in Cambodia  Central America and Western Sahara. The dream of independence for Namibia has at last become a reality.Together with these developments  there is a growing recognition that problems must be resolved through consultation and compromise. There is increasing recourse to the United Nations for the resolution of regional and international problems. The Organization has once again come into its own as an instrument of international peace and security.There are nevertheless other areas that remain inflamed and embattled. The State of Jairanu and Kashmir is torn by strife and repression. For decades the people of Jammu and Kashmir have struggled and fought for their right to self-determination - a right persistently disregarded by India  which has resorted to massive use of force to suppress their struggle. Almost 300 000 Indian military and paramilitary forces have been engaged in an attempt to crush the spontaneous uprising of the Kashmiri people. Thousands of innocent people  including women and children  have been killed  injured and incarcerated. Houses have been burnt down  women have been molested  and major cities in the Valley have been placed under curfew. The Indian Government has banned foreign correspondents and is not prepared to allow any international agency to monitor the flagrant violations of basic human rights and fundamental freedom in Kashmir.These repressive measures have failed to break the will of the people of Kashmir  or to dim their courage or to weaken their spirit of self-sacrifice for: upholding the right of self-determination. The roots of the dispute lie in the forcible annexation of Jammu and Kashmir by India in 1947 against the wishes of the Kashmiri people. The Security Council  in several resolutions  maintained and enjoined that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir should be made in accordance with the will of the people  expressed through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations. Both India and Pakistan accepted those resolutions and are bound by their provisions which remain valid and operative.Through its early resolutions  91 (1951) and 122 (1957)  the Security Council rejected the Indian claim that the people of Kashmir had exercised their right of self-determination by participating in the elections conducted in the territory by India. The Indian contention that elections in Jammu and Kashmir had obviated the need for a plebiscite was manifestly rejected by the fact that the turnout of voters in the 1989 elections was a mere 5 per cent.In the Simla Agreement of July 1972  India recognized Kashmir as an outstanding issue that remained to be settled and it agreed that the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was essential for durable peace and complete normalization of relations between Pakistan and India We urge our Indian neighbours to respect the letter and spirit of the Simla Agreement  which they never tire of repeating  and to come forward to discuss with us the substance of the dispute.Let me state that the popular unrest in Indian-held Kashmir is entirely indigenous in character. India has  however  sought to raise the question of alleged interference by Pakistan as a smoke screen to mislead the international community. We have rejected those allegations as baseless and unfounded. As a further demonstration of our good faith  we have proposed to India the establishment of a neutral mechanism  such as the stationing of impartial international observers to monitor  observe and investigate such accusations and to reach independent conclusions. India has regrettably rejected our offer. Pakistan stands by its proposal and we would be prepared to accept any fact-finding mission or other neutral mechanism for this purpose. We cannot accept - in fact we reject outright - the Indian pretension that they can arrogate to themselves the right to act as judge and prosecutor at the same time.In its efforts to deny Pakistan its right to extend moral and political support to the struggle of the Kashmiri people  India has sought to intimidate us by minatory statements and a threatening concentration of troops in Kashmir along the Pakistan-India border. While we remain committed to the preservation of peace in South Asia  we will not be intimidated or deterred from our quest for a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and in the spirit of the Simla Agreement. We have therefore repeatedly expressed our willingness to enter into a constructive dialogue with India to defuse tension and to seek a peaceful settlement. Although two rounds of talks at the level of foreign secretaries were held in July and August  no substantive results were achieved. The Indian side evaded the core issues  namely  the discussion of the Kashmir dispute and the redeployment of forces to peace-time locations. While we intend to persist in our efforts for a peaceful settlement  the international community must exert its moral and political influence to support the struggle of the people of Kashmir.Last month the 19th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers adopted by consensus a resolution which called for a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions  and as agreed upon in the Simla Agreement. It expressed deep concern over the violations of human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir  and urged the redeployment of forces to peace-time locations. In this resolution  the Conference also expressed its willingness to send a good offices mission to ease tensions and to promote a peaceful settlement. The Indian Government has yet to respond to this positive proposal.The long night of repression of the Kashmiri people who have endured tyranny and unspeakable sufferings must surely see the light of day. Their trial and agony must be brought to an end. How long are they to be denied the exercise of their right to self-determination?Pakistan remains committed to a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through negotiations and dialogue on the basis of the United Nations resolutions. This is in consonance with the terms and the spirit o£ the Simla Agreement.The unwavering and consistent support of the international community for the heroic struggle of the Afghan people against foreign military occupation was largely instrumental in the signing of the Geneva Agreements in 1988  and the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989. The Geneva Agreements addressed only the external aspects of the problem. The framework for the internal settlement was provided by the General Assembly resolutions which called for the establishment of a broad-based government acceptable to the people of Afghanistan  the voluntary return of over 5 million Afghan refugees to their homeland  and the free exercise of the right of the people of Afghanistan to choose their own form of government.The Kabul regime continues to deny the people of Afghanistan their legitimate right to form a government of their own choice. No representative group or segment of the population is willing to enter into negotiations or to share power with the Kabul regime  which is held responsible for the death and destruction that have occurred during the past decade.Pakistan has an abiding interest in the restoration of a peaceful  sovereign  non-aligned and Islamic Afghanistan. The festering conflict prolongs the stay of more than 3 million refugees on our soil. We have  therefore  consistently encouraged Afghan efforts to develop a political consensus for an internal Afghan settlement. Accordingly  we had welcomed the formation of the Afghan Interim Government (AIG) in February 1989. The AIG is now poised to hold elections with the participation of diverse Afghan political elements. This move augurs well for a united front of all Afghans who had valiantly struggled for the liberation of their homeland and in the defence of their faith and traditions.The recent decline in the international humanitarian assistance has aggravated the hardship of the millions of Afghan refugees. They have chosen to face the rigours of exile rather than to expose themselves and their families to the insecurity and uncertainty of conflict in their homeland. Over the years  Pakistan has borne nearly half of the financial cost of providing the Afghan refugees with the bare necessities of life. But our limited resources make it virtually impossible for us to make up for the shortfall in the shrinking international commitment. The international community should not neglect these displaced Afghans and must continue to fulfil its humanitarian obligations towards them until they can return voluntarily to their homes.I should like to pay a tribute to the United Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Representative for the efforts undertaken in the guest of a comprehensive settlement of the Afghanistan problem. I should also like to express our appreciation of the important role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and also of the United Nations Co-ordinator for Economic and Humanitarian Assistance  Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan.Pakistan shares the deep concern of the international community over Iraq's invasion  occupation and annexation of a small neighbouring Islamic country. The Government of Pakistan deplores the use of force by Iraq against Kuwait in violation of the Charter of the United Nations. It is imperative that Iraq unconditionally withdraw its forces  and that the sovereignty and independence  as well as the legitimate Government  of the State of Kuwait  must be restored.In the profound belief that international difficulties must be resolved through negotiations  we have supported the actions taken by the Security Council to counter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait and will extend full co-operation in the implementation of the Security Council resolutions.We estimate that the crisis in the Gulf will result in an extra burden for Pakistan of over a billion dollars because of trade suspension  increase in the price of oil and the loss of remittances from our nationals employed in Kuwait and the Middle East. Our difficulties would be compounded by worsening terms of trade on account of enhanced prices of imports and reduced income from exports. These factors have compelled Pakistan to invoke Article 50 of the Charter  but we remain committed to adhere to the decisions of the Security Council. In the Middle East  Israel has systematically undermined all initiatives aimed at a just and lasting solution of the problem. An urgent effort by the international community is required to promote an equitable and comprehensive solution encompassing the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  and the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination and to establish a State of their own in Palestine.Pakistan has been following with interest the initiative of the five permanent members of the Security Council on the issue of Cambodia. We hope their efforts and those of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will prove fruitful.The Cyprus issue remains unresolved after 27 years. We believe that the recent Security Council resolution which calls for a freely reached and mutually acceptable solution to be arrived at through negotiations on an equal footing  provides the right framework for the conduct of inter-communal negotiations. This should lead to the desired goal of the establishment of a bi-communal bizonal Federal Republic of Cyprus.Recent developments in South Africa are a step in the right direction but all far short of the eradication of apartheid. The changes instituted by the Pretoria regime would not have been possible without the courage  determination and perseverance of the people of South Africa. Mr. Nelson Mandela symbolizes the indomitable spirit of that people.The Government of Pakistan fully supports the valiant struggle of the people of South Africa for freedom  equality and justice. We believe that the sanctions imposed against the racist Pretoria regime should continue to be applied till the complete elimination of apartheid and the establishment of majority rule in South ; Africa.Pakistan has always been in the forefront of endeavours to promote international peace and security and to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons. We hope that the dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union will culminate in an agreement for substantial reduction in their nuclear arsenals and eventually lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Pending the achievements of the ultimate objective of nuclear disarmament  legally binding international arrangements must be worked out to assure all non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. The conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  which is an essential first step towards halting and reversing the nuclear arms race  has eluded us in the past. It is for that reason that we welcome the decision to convene in January 1991 a conference to consider converting the partial test-ban Treaty into a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty Pakistan supports global negotiations for general and complete disarmament. Progress towards this goal has been slow. It is essential to consider measures for disarmament at the regional level in order to strengthen peace and security. The insecurity of non-nuclear States emanates from regional threats arising from territorial disputes  ambitions of dominance and interventionist policies of larger neighbouring States. Furthermore  the security concerns of States vary from region to region depending upon the nature of their threat perceptions. Therefore  a regional approach offers the most realistic prospects for rapid progress towards disarmament. We are gratified that such an approach is gaining wider acceptance  and we urge that disarmament negotiations should be pursued simultaneously at the global as well at the regional levels.Pakistan is fully committed to the objective of nuclear non-proliferation. It calls upon the nuclear Powers to move towards nuclear disarmament and to promote international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology. The concept of nuclear non-proliferation must not be used as a pretext to prevent the developing countries from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. I should like to reiterate that Pakistan would be willing to accept any equitable and non-discriminatory agreement with effective verification arrangements that would commit the countries of the South Asia region  in a legally binding manner  not to acquire or produce nuclear weapons. Furthermore  we have proposed that  pending the adoption of a global treaty  regional or bilateral test-ban agreements may be concluded. Pakistan has also made a proposal for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia  which has been repeatedly endorsed by the General Assembly.Pakistan supports all steps to prevent an arms race in outer space. We attach equal importance to the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention prohibiting the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.Negotiations on conventional disarmament at the global and regional levels must also be pursued vigorously  especially because of the increase in the sophistication and destructive power of conventional weapons. Similarly  naval disarmament has become an equally important objective because of the rapid augmentation of the naval power of some States. The acquisition of aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines is a cause for grave concern.During most of the past decade the international economic environment for the developing countries has been marked by negative resource flows  proliferation of trade barriers  a crushing debt burden and high interest rates  all of which combine to create devastating consequences for the economies of a large number of developing countries.Official development assistance remains a major component of development financing. A substantial increase in the flows of official development assistance would be essential to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product  as reaffirmed by the Declaration adopted at the special session of the General Assembly in April this year. Multilateral institutions should also be provided with sufficient resources to support development and to facilitate structural reforms in the developing countries. For their part  those countries must take appropriate measures to mobilize domestic resources and effect structural adjustments to make their economies responsive to the impulses of growth. Needless to say  an equitable and conducive external environment is indispensable for the success of their efforts.A solution to the debt problem  which has serious implications for the developing world  should take into account considerations of growth and stability  it is equally important to ensure that a solution to the problem of external debt should provide relief to countries that have been prudent in managing their economies. It is becoming increasingly difficult to service debts in the climate of imbalances in external payments.In order to ensure the creation and distribution of world liquidity on an equitable basis the exports of the developing countries must have easy access to world markets and their exports must be guaranteed reasonable prices. We hope that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations will create a free international trading system with preferential treatment for the developing countries. We are gratified that the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  to be adopted at this session  incorporates the necessary guidelines to redress the serious economic problems confronting the developing nations.We welcome the growing international awareness of the need to preserve the global environment. Pakistan has consistently supported efforts to achieve that shared objective. It remains our belief that in the developing countries the improvement of the environment is closely linked to the eradication of poverty. It is imperative that developed countries should provide additional financial resources and technology to the developing countries to combat environmental degradation. We hope that the 1992 Conference on Environment will address the complex dimensions of the problem in its entirety and will find credible answers to the effects on the environment of unbridled industrialization  on the one hand  and abject poverty  on the other. The problem of narcotic drugs has assumed alarming proportions and is threatening the fabric of contemporary society. The special session of the General Assembly on narcotic drugs in February this year underlined the need for the global community to act in concert. The guidelines provided in the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted at the special session need to be implemented in full  and we believe that reduction in the demand for narcotic drugs is as important as reduction in the cultivation  production and supply of narcotic substances. It is also necessary to provide the cultivators with alternate sources of income through crop substitution.The events of the past year have demonstrated that the United Nations has a central and vital role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. The Organization has an equally pivotal role in solving problems of an economic  social  cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Pakistan will continue to support  in the fullest measure  all the activities of the United Nations  confident of success and determined in its efforts to realize the cherished objectives of international peace and progress enshrined in its Charter."
"113",5480,"PAN",45,1990,"﻿Let me begin by saying we are very pleased at the election of Guido de Marco as President of the General Assembly. I must also recognise the efforts of the Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar  on behalf of peace and of the renewal of this Organisation. Let me also express our satisfaction over the admission of Namibia and Liechtenstein to membership of this Organisation this year.For the first time in 22 years the people of Panama is legitimately and authentically represented in this world Organisation.From 1968 - when a leader newly elected by the people was the victim of a crude military coup d'etat - until the end of last year  force of arms and the constant threat of its use dominated the Panamanian people and stole the government of my country. The concepts of justice  ethics  the common good  development and democracy during those years had the meaning that those usurpers wanted to give them. They did not have the true meaning reflected in the conscience of the people and in the values of the nation.On 7 May last year  the citizens of Panama went to the polls an masse and in an orderly way  displaying an exemplary public spirit. Those elections were called by a military dictatorship that was worn out and repudiated and which thought to cling to power through trickery and coercion before and during that public referendum. The people expressed its will overwhelmingly against the dictatorial regime and in favour of democracy  freedom and hope.From this rostrum and in the name of all Panamanians  I would like to thank all friendly peoples  all Governments  all international institutions and all those people of good will which  with their presence in our country  testified to the result of those elections in May and with their moral authority strengthened our spirit of struggle.But when fraud  coercion and downright cheating were not enough to deflect the desire for change clearly shown in the electoral process  the tyranny turned to farce. In a blatant and shameful act  the Government annulled the elections. It told the people that the elections which it had itself called  organised and administered were not valid. Then with a stroke of a pen  through a decree that lacked any legal or moral backing  they slapped down the highest moral and civic values of Panamanians.The rest of the story is known: more persecutions and more exiles  murders harassment and violations of human rights. How sad it was for the Panamanian people to find itself alone. The international community did not realize the vital importance our fight had for us  nor did it see it in its full dimension as a lamentable example for other peoples.International diplomacy gave us a choice between accepting the conditions which the illegitimate government imposed in order to stay in power and having recourse to the human slaughter that would result from a civil war between a defenceless people and an army equipped with weapons. Only a few friendly countries really understood the full extent of the suffering of our people and its legitimate aspirations and supported us. When force and arrogance gave way to madness  the final outcome was irreversible. With all the constitutional  legal and moral rights given us months before by the overwhelming popular mandate  we took power under the most chaotic of circumstances. There were no basic institutions to support a democratic' government. There was no structure capable of assuring even the minimum' public order required. There was no legislative branch  inasmuch as its orderly reorganization had been prevented. The Supreme Court of Justice was without a leader. The Government Treasury had been virtually looted  since public funds had been controlled and directly abused by military headquarters  Public employees were not paid in full or on time.Payment of the public debt had been completely disregarded in the last three years  and consequently all sources of new credit had disappeared. Political instability in the last years  together with the economic sanctions imposed on the Panamanian Government by the United States Government in 1986  produced a sudden depression in the national economy  which suffered a fall of soma 16 per cent of gross domestic product in that year alone. Public revenues were reduced by half. The unemployment rate went up to 18 per cent  a figure never before seen in our history.Unemployment became the most serious problem we faced. The decrease  or absence  of income caused the basic needs of the population to remain generally unmet. Forty-five per cent of our people are considered poor; the vast majority of children live in poor homes. Poverty and unemployment most harshly affect young women from 15 to 24 years of age.There is a great scarcity of housing  reflected in a growing shortage of accommodations and in dehumanizing overcrowding. The difficulty of financing the construction of housing for the poor has led to the proliferation of shanty towns.A lack of investment in health and education  especially in recent years  has caused a deterioration of services for the poor. Malnutrition  a lack of drinking water and poor education are problems we inherited from the dictatorship and from the difficulties of recent years.I must note with regret that social problems affect primarily children  youth  women  the indigenous population and senior citizens. Today I want to speak in the name of my people. I want to bring before the representatives of all the world's countries the voice of the Panamanian people  which suffers but which has hope; the voice of the peasant who works from morning to night under the hot sun or in the tropical rain to survive in his poverty; the voice of the worker  used to hard work  who searches for the decent job he has yet to find; the voice of the mother who puts her children to bed at night without any food in their stomachs; the voice of the child who sells newspapers  of the shoeshine boy  or of the child who stands on the street-corner selling anything to take a crust of bread back to his family  his childhood and his education cut off  forced to be an adult before his time; the voice of the ill without medicine and without the need to be ill; the voice of the poor man without a roof over his head  or a bed to sleep in  or shelter for the night.Those are voices I want to make heard in this Hall  which houses the conscience of mankind. That is the flag I want to raise. That is the cry I wish to be heard in all corners of the world: There is suffering in the world  and we have to end it.Fortunately  in Panama there is a fresh breeze filling us with hope and optimism. We are breathing the air of freedom in a climate of democracy. We Panamanians today control our future. Democratic institutions are working. Democracy must respond to the material and spiritual needs of the Panamanian people.The three duly established branches of Government are working independent of one another  in an awareness that the concentration of power is a danger we must avoid by all means. We have abolished the army because the Panamanian people does not want any more armies - much less the cost of one. Only a few days ago  in an unprecedented act in our history  the civil authorities proclaimed the retirement of 142 officials who had been a part of the former army. In that way we are demilitarizing the structures charged with the maintenance of public order. In Panama today there no generals or colonels. There are no lieutenant-colonels either.There is full freedom of speech and total respect for human rights. The gaols house only common criminals. Only Panamanians who do so of their own free will live outside their homeland.In the economic sphere  we are already feeling a resurgence of suppressed energies. Confidence on internal and external matters is growing. In the banking sector  restrictions that had existed for two years on certificates of deposit were lifted a few months ago with no adverse effect on the liquidity of the system. On the contrary  bank deposits grew in 1990.The construction industry  which directly and indirectly generates many jobs  is being reactivated  as seen by the increase in the number of construction permits issued this yea?  Tourism in Panama and hotel occupancy are increasing daily. The volume of business of the Colon Free Zone has increased considerably. We shall soon have a new law permitting the establishment of industries in multi-sector zones for export. We have an aggressive policy to stimulate our exports.We are arranging our public finances  putting things in order and facing - responsibly - the huge external debt we inherited. We are putting into effect a modest but efficient public investment programme that satisfies the most urgent needs of the community.We want political democracy to be accompanied by economic democracy. All opportunities should be open to all citizens. We believe in economic growth  but also in human development. Our main concern is unemployment and the poor. We have a very large unemployed labour force - men and women - many of them heads of household  with a high level of education hoping to find decent jobs.We have to meet enormous housing  health  nutrition and education needs  above all for the children  who are the future. We fully aware that investment in our human capital is a priority if we are to achieve sustained economic development  to benefit all sectors of the population.We must bring about a successful democracy that really meets the needs of the population. I know that is this task we can count on the help of the Governments of the developed countries of our continent  Europe and Asia and the goodwill of international associations in terms of financing and technical co-operation. This help and co-operation acquire a new meaning in the post-cold-war world  which we celebrate in 1990. I shall return to this subject later. So far I have spoken of Panama’s recent history and its present experiences  because they explain our firm positions on many items on the international agenda and because we consider that the United Nations should be the sounding-board for the ideals and aspirations of the men and women of the world. I believe that our experience is enriched to a greater or lesser degree  by all the countries represented here.First  because we have suffered at first hand  we have established by law the principle that we shall never recognise any Government originating from a military coup against a legitimate regime elected in popular elections or a Government holding power as  result of electoral fraud or its prevention of elections provided for by the domestic 1m of the State in question. We shall make no exception; we shall be inflexible. We who deceives and rejects the will of his people will find no encouragement or support from either my people or my Government. Secondly  we are concerned about the present situation of democracy throughout the world and especially in the countries of the American continent. We unreservedly support all measures conducive to a rapid solution of any electoral problem. We are pleased by the readiness of the Security Council and the Secretariat to find a viable solution to the case of Haiti  especially because Panama did not have the benefit of the same treatment when it needed it recently.Thirdly  we support all actions that will contribute to ensuring political  civil and human rights  guaranteed by international conventions. We are committed under the San Jose Convention to respect the competence and decisions of the Central American Court of Justice  which we are sure will become the highest guarantor of the human rights of all the people of our continent. We also believe in the work of the bodies dealing with civil and political rights within the United Nations  which will receive the full and constant support of the Panamanian Government.Fourthly  we shall use all the means available to us to fight the drug traffic and its financial instruments  because our country was one of the direct victims of the drug economy  as a result of the actions of the military Government. We have taken measures in our domestic legislation to combat the laundering of drug money  by requiring that all bank transactions exceeding a certain amount be registered. We are willing to co-operate in international efforts in this regard. We are signatories of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  which should soon be submitted to our legislative branch for study and ratification.Fifthly  we agree on the need to supervise the production of arms worldwide and the trade in arms for terrorist and anti-democratic purposes. We  who played a part in the arms trade under the military government  are drawing up measures to prevent the illegal movement of arms and military material. We must stop this deadly trade  as the Federal Republic of Germany recently suggested here.Sixthly  we believe that this Organisation and all the bodies linked to it should continue their work on priority matters of universal concern  such as the freedom of the individual  the eradication of poverty and human development with participation  to give a human perspective to economic growth. Action taken by the United Nations  together with parallel action at the national level by leaders truly committed to the achievement of their peoples' well-being  will lead us  in what remains of this century  to make up for lost time.We should welcome the twenty-first century in a more constructive environment  in which people are less anguished and less anxious and are more satisfied with what they can achieve by their own efforts and with God's help. I should like the General Assembly soon to declare a Decade on Poverty  dedicated to concentrating our efforts to stop the increase in poverty  illness and illiteracy in our world and to reduce them to a minimum.We are taking part in this forty-fifth session of the General Assembly in a year of extraordinary transformations  which have brought about a rebirth of the United Nations as an organisation with renewed functions and tasks. At the end of the cold war this Organisation in emerging into a world in which peace and international co-operation are truly feasible. Free of the tensions between the super-Powers  the United Nations can now devote itself fully to promoting social peace  human development and respect for human rights. The road is open for enhanced action leading to positive results. In this post-cold-war environment the time is right for ending one of the last legacies of that past era: the exclusion of the Republic of Korea from this Organisation. The Republic of Korea is willing to contribute  as an active member  to promoting world peace and international co-operation  and it should not be excluded for a moment longer. Its full participation will represent an important commitment to facilitating the process of reconciliation in the Koreas Peninsula in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Charter. Panama confidently supports the incorporation of the Republic of Korea into the Organisation as soon as possible.We also support implementation of Security Council resolutions aimed at solving the question of Cyprus in order to eliminate the last vestiges of the cold war.In the post-cold-war environment there is a sombre black cloud. We arc meeting at a time of grave crisis in the Middle East. The future of a nation and the lives of thousands of innocent people hang by a thread.I wish to take this opportunity to express the unconditional support of my Government for the commendable actions taken by the Security Council in defence of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence. The level of co-operation it has achieved  its serious deliberations and the worth of its decisions have raised the authority of the United Nations to unprecedented levels. It has won universal respect. The cruel invasion of its neighbour by Iraq has reminded us how fragile peace is in our world. This crude aggression has not only provoked our condemnation  but has shown  as never before  the interdependence of the nations of the world. We have recognised that the loss of freedom  no matter how small the country where it occurs  can jeopardise social peace and prosperity even in larger countries. The Government of Panama has faithfully complied with measures adopted by the Security Council to put an end to the Gulf crisis. It also firmly supports the actions taken thus far under United Nations authority and is willing to support any additional measures it may authorise.I wish to note that Panama has made much progress in the last few months end will continue to do so. Panamanians want to see Panama sovereign over all its territory - in undisputed possession of all its resources  developing the  all for its own benefit primarily  but also for the benefit of the world. I reaffirm my Government’s complete respect for the 1977 Canal Treaties and my country's international obligations.I wish to see Panama respected by all nations  and we will achieve this because Panama respects itself  and the Government respects its people. We participate  without fear or complexes  in all our international relations because we are confident and aware of our own worth.I am especially pleased to announce a historic fact: at the head of the administration of the inter-oceanic waterway there is  for the first time in history  a Panamanian citizen designated by my Government. Observance of the corresponding provisions of the Canal Treaty shows the intention of the Government of the United States of America to fulfil all its obligations and commitments under the 1977 Treaties. We view this willingness on the part of the United States with optimism  even though the problems which we must still discuss with the United States are many.The reference to our inter-oceanic waterway leads me to define our concept of the Panama Canal in the twenty-first century. It is a Panamanian canal  and it will be managed by Panamanians  but based on the multilateral interests of all its users. We will take into account the needs of the world and  most especially  the needs of the friendly countries of the hemisphere. For this reason  the Government of Panama will periodically consult with the Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean so that Canal policies will take into account the interests of all.I wish to have good relations with all countries. I wish to have even better relations with those countries which share similar interests. Panama will prosper and will enjoy peace because its people is hardworking and because Panamanians share in the ideals of democracy  justice and freedom  and always seek the truth.May God always enlighten all Panamanians so that we do not deviate from this path. May God enlighten the Governments of the world so that they share the aspirations  ideals and hopes of the Panamanian people and its Government."
"114",5527,"PER",45,1990,"﻿In greeting you  Mr. President  and in congratulating you on your well-deserved election in circumstances of special significance for international peace and security  I reiterate Peru's commitment to the United Nations system and to the norms and principles of international law.It was no coincidence that the first action taken by Mr. Alberto Fujimori as President-elect of Peru was to approach the United Nations system with the firm intention of reintegrating Peru into the international financial community. President Fujimori intended that gesture also to express recognition of the decisive role the United Nations plays in maintaining international peace and security  the rule of international law  respect for human rights and the promotion of effective solutions to the difficult social and economic problems affecting the developing world.The evolution of world political events over the past 12 months has taken on the pace characteristic of historical turning points: 1989 and 1990 symbolize changes in the international structure comparable only to those of 1789  1914 and 1945.The cold war has ended. Bloc politics is on its way out. The physical  political and economic geography of post-War Europe has also changed  promising unimaginable consequences - a situation that could not have been foreseen only a few months ago. Those changes  which affect the political  military and social structures of the European continent  go hand in hand with profound reformulations in the field of ideas and political and strategic doctrines. The dynamics of such changes are harbingers of the twenty-first century in our own time.The changes in Eastern Europe are the expression of an essentially peaceful revolution that  along with the globalization of the world economy and the ongoing evolution in technological progress  entails the rise and consolidation of four principal peaceful trends in the new international situation.First  the cold-war dichotomy based on the supposed inevitability of conflict  which pitted competing strategic doctrines against each other  is being replaced by realities that have made bloc-oriented dogmas obsolete. Those realities are finding expression in the rise of a more hopeful logic  one of conciliation  dialogue  understanding and co-operation among the great Powers. Thus  the so-called East-West conflict has evolved into a new system free from ideological antagonism in which the differences between socio-economic and political systems tend to diminish. Those factors  along with initiatives and agreements on the limitation of nuclear and conventional arms  clearly give the North a degree of stability unprecedented in this century. They represent the winds of a qualitatively new kind of détente that we salute and welcome in a spirit of solidarity with peoples that are rightly rejoicing in reunification  in reconciliation  in progress towards peace and security and in prospects of economic union and improvement of their standards of living.Secondly  a dispassionate and well-balanced assessment of the world economic and social situation tells us that the end of the cold war has not yet had positive effects for developing regions. The international economy continues unable to bridge the gaps created by existing disparities. The impact of economic globalisation and interdependence is not yet balanced. The developing countries continue to face increasing and more radical marginalization.For the first time in this century a well-co-ordinated system of guidelines for a truly macro-economic international policy has begun to be formulated among the industrialized economies  the international financial system and the competent international organizations  within the framework of structural adjustment.However  the developing countries have so far been only passive actors in that process  despite the fact that their economic policies must necessarily take into account external factors that are  in many cases  basic to their own development. There is therefore an urgent need to integrate the developing countries  through an ad hoc mechanism based on consensus  into the international macro-economic decision-making process and  in particular  to introduce into comprehensive schemes for adjustment and stabilisation elements that can recast development theory and take account of goals for social progress designed to halt and reverse the spiralling and inhumane increase in dire poverty.Thirdly  as the Secretary-General stresses in his annual report to the General Assembly  at the apex of those two trends - balance and detente in the North  on the one hand  and  en the other  imbalances and growing poverty in the South - we find a Janus-like international situation that wears both the face of hope and the face of dangerous unrestraint.A number of complex factors have been added to the imbalances in the South and the legitimate despair to which the vicious circle of poverty and recession might lead. Such factors could unleash new and unforeseen conflicts in a regional context. Further contributing to that situation are the negative factors of uncontrolled and increasing arms transfers. While trends towards disarmament and détente grow stronger  the spread of technological and industrial know-how finds expression in the proliferation of centres of production of increasingly sophisticated weapons. The qualitative improvement in arms production has brought about the risk of new conflicts in this third world.Lastly  looking at Janus' positive face  dogmatic ideologies are being rejected by peoples everywhere and we note that the sole ideology on which universal consensus exists is that of human rights. Individual liberties  political  social and economic rights and the rights of peoples - in short  all the inherent rights of the human being - have become universal. Democracy has become the common heritage of mankind.The spectacular progress achieved in this essential field of political and social life in recent years  particularly with regard to individual liberties and civil and social rights in Eastern Europe  or  as in the case of Namibia  the right the people  stands in sharp contrast to Janus' other  pessimistic  face  reflecting as it does the deterioration of the economic and social rights of the peoples of the third world and the inadequate level of international co-operation in the fight against dire poverty. When we see increasing levels of hunger in a world producing food surpluses we know that humanism cannot remain a mere abstraction. We must also bear in mind that human rights should not be proclaimed exclusively for future generations of the developing world but also for all men  woman and children who at this very time are enduring the affront of poverty that is their daily lot.At the same level of international social problems  nation States are facing new challenges  new forms and modalities of aggression  conflict and violence. Terrorism and the illicit traffic in drugs have become deadly factors in international relations. The illicit traffic in drugs is a phenomenon which affects most parts of the world: we are seeing the emergence of a veritable democracy  and we are suffering from this as much in producer countries as in those affected by consumption and illicit traffic. This is not just a matter of the dual danger inherent in drugs trafficking and narco-terrorism; it is a matter of an economic power threatening the very fabric of society and generating unacceptable pressures and imbalances in the economic and political structures of States.Peru is one of the countries most affected by illicit production  and my Government is resolutely committed to intensifying the struggle to eradicate it. However  we are convinced that we will not win this battle by using repressive measures alone: there is a need for strategies to promote crop substitution and a drastic reduction in consumption. This is a struggle where international responsibility is shared  in which the international community and the countries most severely affected by consumption must play their proper parts  given the extraordinary scale of the problem.The Cartagena Declaration  signed by the Governments of Bolivia  Colombia  the United States and Peru  is a substantive step forward  but if it is to become reality  all the undertakings made must be implemented as matters of urgency. Given that the United Nations Conference on the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and the new Convention on drugs have made provision - as another substantive expression of the worth of multilateral concertation - for a wide range of measures to combat  as priorities  the production and illicit traffic in drugs  it is imperative that an international conference should be called on the subject of the consumption of drugs and the laundering of the income from the drugs traffic. Peru in the present crisis in the Persian Gulf  the Security Council has defined international legality  and ray Government strongly supports the demand that Iraqi troops should withdraw from Kuwait. We hope that the consensus that international law must be respected will in the end make possible a peaceful solution to this serious situation.In this progress towards strengthening the United Nations and increasing its effectiveness  the international community is finding new opportunities for dealing with complex situations in the economic and social fields. We do not expect the serious problems of the South to be solved only through multilateral action. That would be too much to expect. However  while it is acknowledged that the economic problems of developing countries will have to be solved essentially by their own means  it is equally true that there is a need for a multilateral approach to problems such as inadequate financing for the stabilisation process  depressed prices for commodities  trade restrictions  reverse resource transference  limited transfer of technological innovation and  basically  serious questions of poverty and the deterioration of the living standards of the people. It is indispensable to reappraise  within a multilateral framework  the variables of social development and the role which a renewed strategy of co-operation for development must play in the new world economic situation. Multilateral definitions in this area cannot be too specific  but they must establish appropriate guidelines in order to make it possible for regional  subregional and bilateral agreements to produce effective solutions.Peru has established a new Government  which was democratically elected by the majority of its people  despite the threat made by terrorists to violate the social and political rights of the Peruvian people and despite a serious economic and social situation. Heedless to say  the economic and social situation in Peru shows symptoms of an emergency of such dimensions that  above and beyond compromising its economic basis  has clearly expressed itself in social conditions that demand a concerted effort of national unity to overcome the crisis. Therefore  my country's new Government has appealed for a national consensus calling on all the political and social forces to join together to overcome the present crisis and to eliminate illegal drug trafficking and terrorism. The seriousness of the situation we Peruvians face can be judged by certain clear signet in a region of the Andes  the poorest region in Peru  infant mortality has reached a rate of 114 out of 1 000 - between 1987 and 199C the total gross investment was less than the amount required to offset the depreciation of the infrastructure  factories and equipment in the country - between 14 May 1980 and 27 July 1990 the Peruvian people were victims of some 18 000 terrorist attacks and this same homicidal activity has violated the fundamental right to life of almost 18 000 persons who have died as a result of political violence.Consequently  despite the inevitable stringency  the programme of economic stabilisation has been received with understanding by the Peruvian people  who  in their best ethical tradition  have decided to face the monetary cost of this stabilisation patiently  while maintaining their hope for better times and the trust engendered by a leadership that is seeking to restore a moral meaning to political affairs.It is in such circumstances that nations emerge as agents of their own destiny. This is the case of the Peruvian people  who  in the arduous task of overcoming the crisis  act with the same dignity and the same sense of solidarity as that which characterised ancient Andean civilisations  which build societies where well-being  justice and efficiency were shared values.In order to overcome the crisis  three programmes have been outlined and are being implemented in the most efficient way possible: a programme for economic stabilisation  a social emergency programme  and a programme to neutralize the effects of the drought. It is indispensable for the success of the stabilisation programme that the Government  the church and the non-governmental organizations should be able to carry out the social emergency programme effectively. The social gap in Peru has widened 55 per cent of its population live in dire poverty and 32 per cent in conditions of deprivation.This social gap has been worsened by the negative effects of the drought in the southern Andes and  for the time being  by the temporary impact that every economic stabilisation programme inevitably brings about at first especially when it is commensurate with the magnitude of the imbalances to be addressed. It is important to note that the social emergency programme reflects not only the demands and needs of the Peruvian people but also the international consensus that is emerging with regard to the Peruvian situation in its effort to establish stability  while at the same time preserving the human aspects of the Peruvian economy.In a way that is in keeping with the political consensus and national unity  austerity measures have been proposed which involve an intense fight against corruption! an austerity that is understood not only as a reduction of government expenditure  but also as a means of restoring the ancient principles which are inherent in our Andean tradition and which are in keeping with a way of life that we must preserve in order to strengthen the traditional values of our people for the future.This is the challenge which we Peruvians are ready to face in calling for a national consensus and through a moral and political commitment. We are convinced of the active support for these efforts by the international community and  most especially  by those friendly nations that are enjoying greater stability and prosperity as well as by international organisations  non-governmental agencies and organisations committed to co-operation for development and emergency assistance. We are confident that we have the support of all of them. We hope the response will be commensurate with the needs and the enormous efforts of the noble and exemplary Peruvian people.As a special request of the President of Peru  Mr. Alberto Fujimori  I would like to put on record the warm gratitude of the Government and the people of Peru for the valuable assistance and support given by the Secretary-General of our Organisation  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. We firmly believe that the measures he has instituted to establish a broad scheme of co-operation with Peru will reach their lofty goal.I also would like to extend our gratitude to the Governments and international organisations that have already given their co-operation and support  especially in regard to food. For the Peruvian people  overcoming this situation is not only a government responsibility  but also primarily an ethical and moral commitment of national scope.  This is the sum· commitment that  with regard to the struggle against terrorism  inspired President Fujimori to stress the respect for human rights  which is rooted in our historic traditions and recognized in our constitutional structure. President Fujimori was categorical when he stated: ""The terrorist violence faced at this time by our young democracy cannot justify  in any case  the systematic or sporadic violation of human rights. The anti-terrorist fight my Government will wage will be framed by and carried out according to the principles of the Constitution and the laws of the Republic. This perspective will be applied with fairness and justice  both to those who presently commit offences against our- society and to those who protect it"". We are obviously familiar with the moral difference between them. Mankind is on the verge of the third millennium of our era. In spite of events and situations that threaten the possibility of having a safer and more just world  there are global trends that make us more optimistic. Peace  justices and security are interrelated values. We hope that the new international situation now going shaped takes them into account in an unprecedented agreement of solidarity between the poor and the rich  the weak and the strong."
"115",5574,"PHL",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of President Corason Aquino and the Philippine delegation  I extend to you  Sir  and to the people and Government of the Republic of Malta  warmest felicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your country reflects the rich Mediterranean blond of races and cultures and is therefore a microcosm of this Assembly  over which  with much deserved honour  you now preside. Likewise  I should like at this point to thank His Excellency Joseph K. Garba of Nigeria  the outgoing President of the General Assembly and to congratulate him on work well done. There were many accomplishments during his time not the least of which was the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  which produced a significant consensus declaration on economic co-operation - so important in our guest for peace.It is a year since we last met. Each year of events has its own character. We may call this year  1990 - this first in the United Nations Decade of International Law - the year of the reality of freedom and the possibility of peace.Some may think this characterisation naive in the contest of the threat to peace in a critical area of the world. But the facts are there.The dream of one democratic Europe was once thought to be an absurd fantasy. For the only formula was thought to be the destruction by war of monolithic repression. And everyone knew it would have to be a nuclear war  which no one could win.The idea of a totally democratic and therefore peaceful Latin America was once thought to be an empty illusion. There were too many odds against it. There was that theory  for instance  long ago proven bankrupt but still persistent  that democracy is an invention that suits only the developed West. And there was that super-Power policy  now happily  amended  to encourage military dictators because it is easier to deal abroad with one man than with a messy democratic regime.The dream of a successful settlement in Cambodia and therefore of peace in South-East Asia was until only a month ago thought to be impossible. It seemed useless to try to unravel the intricate ideological and historical intertwining in that unhappy land  or to find a graceful exit for the intervening Powers. Those Powers had fostered surrogates  and those surrogates had found their own domestic differences aggravated by policies designed in distant foreign capitals. Yet all these impossible dreams have in this concluding year found either actual  or at least inchoate  reality. The democratisation of Eastern Europe  though not yet total  is real. For the first time in history  all of continental Latin America is democratic. The initial instruments for peace in Cambodia have been executed  and the intervening Powers are finding their graceful exits and divided nations are being remedied today Germany; tomorrow  we hope  Korea.It is the confluence of three historical factors that has produced this pioneering prospect for universal peace. The first in the rise of the power of the peoples of the world. One by one  these peoples have spoken  and this is their simple but non-negotiable demand: ""We want democracy. We want peace."" That was the message of our Philippine people-power revolution of 1986. And since then it has resonated through the public places of the world  toppling dictators and defenestrating repressive ideologies It is never people who propose war; it is Governments. Therefore peace  universal peace  will be possible only when all the peoples of the world are free and when it is their voice that commands the structure of every Government.There is a second factor in the success of the peace process. Efforts for peace have failed before  but where they have succeeded persistence has been a dominant ingredient. In Eastern Europe and in Latin America the people never gave up. In Cambodia the leaders never gave up. The Jakarta meetings and the Paris Conference  Ali Altas and Roland Dumas never gave up. The permanent members of the Security Council never gave up.There is that third factor. It is the United Nations. This perseverance of the United Nations""  in the language of the Secretary-General's report of September 1990  has produced peace and democracy in Namibia a quarter of a century after the General Assembly resolution and a dozen years after the Security Council action.We sense the coming death of apartheid in the wake of peaceful United Nations initiatives. We see the rise of the new democracy in Nicaragua; e cease-fire in democratic El Salvador; a political solution in democratic Guatemala; a referendum in Western Sahara  the promotion of a consensus among guarantor Powers in Afghanistan.The inventory of the Secretary-General's successes is long indeed. Then  is only one sombre cloud in the world and it hangs over that region we have come to call the Middle East. Perhaps the first step towards understanding that region is to give proper recognition to its objective geographic position. The region called the Far East once possessed only a relative colonial Euro-centric identity until it cam· into its own as East Asia. Why ""Middle East""? Middle between what? The term was coined only in 1902 by a Western expansionist. The region is West Asia and North Africa and it is time to recognise then as objective absolutes.The people of Mast Asia and North Africa must be no different from those of Eastern Europe and Latin America in their human aspirations. Their demand  if self-articulated  would be irrevocable freedom and peace. Last week. President François Mitterrand spoke to this Assembly on guarantees for ""the democratic expression of the Kuwaiti people's will"". Why  indeed  should the rhetoric of national responses to the crisis in that region be devoid of any mention of those values while the rest of the world is awash with the tidal wave of democracy and peace?We hear of violations of borders  of threats to territorial integrity  of mass displacement of human beings  of disruption of the oil market  of devastation of economies and of destruction of lives. These are grave acts and the Philippines has from their inception joined the United Nations in their condemnation.We have accepted the Security Council resolutions and implemented them  even as we have joined other Asian Governments in appreciating the positive attitude of the Iraqi Government towards the evacuation of our workers  and even as we appreciate the assistance to our evacuees by Jordan  Saudi Arabia  Iran and the United Arab Emirates  by Spain  Japan  New Zealand and by the United Nations agencies  particularly the International Organisation for Migration and the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation  which have been doing their work with the assistance of the European Community and the United States of America. The United Nations and with it the significant Powers of the world are joined in confronting this threat and in searching for a formal for peace.But perhaps we should be hearing more suggestions that this crisis - with its Chinese character combination of danger and opportunity - might be an occasion  after territorial sovereignties are restored  to attune that region to the marching beat of our new worlds democracy  freedom and peace for all.This is a rallying call for all to bring peace to West Asia. The call is for all and why not? It is the concern of all when one nation invades another  when hundreds of thousands of workers are displaced  when fuel costs bring poor economics to their knees.But many of us are already prostrate on our knees and it is not just the West Asian crisis that has brought us down to this abject position. Time and again we have come to this Assembly for relief. I do not speak for a country in arrears when I make this plea in behalf of all the debtor nations of the world. The Philippine debt is inherited from a dictator. But it is an inherited obligation and we honour it. The Philippines is a faithful payer of principal and interest. We indulge in no radical posturing. We impose on ourselves no unilateral moratoriums.To service our debt our country must divert over 40 per cent of our annual budget for payments on our debt and almost a third of this is for foreign debt service. Since 1986 we have sent out annually $1.7 billion more than we receive. How shall we resolve debt? It is valuable to reschedule debt. But it is even more precious and human to forgive debt.The makers of policy must agree to resolve the question: Who is entitled to debt relief and debt forgiveness? Is it possible to fix standards rather than leave the answer to the strengths and weaknesses of negotiators and financial markets? They must agree to alternative adjustment programmes to promote growth that will suit both planned and free economies.The Philippines profoundly appreciates the relief it is receiving through the operations of the Brady Plan  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the makers of policy must develop new modes to carry but global solutions  for the present mechanisms are not equipped for such a momentous mission.The IMF traditionally approaches short-term problems  like balance of payments  with an average span of 18 months. But the structural and financial horizons of transnational debt can span a generation.The World Bank has primarily concerned itself with financing projects and  more recently  with programmes. Yet it is only in the contest of an aggregate panorama that the financial obligations of nations can be amply appreciated.It is now almost a decade that the debt crisis has been thundering across our planet. The assault is overwhelming us because our defences are isolated and our strategies fragmented. We propose a global counter-attack by forces that will transcend geography and ideology.If the whole world can be summoned to confront the invaders in West Asia  why may we not summon this same world to confront that invader from the nether world of international finance  that monster created by debtor and creditor alike? Are we not entitled to marshal the cerebral talents of nations for this confrontation?At Versailles  in 191S  the victorious allies of the First World War refused to condone the enervating obligations of the defeated Germans and Germany went to the radical right for a solution. That solution produced the Second World War. The Allies  again victorious in 1945  remembered Versailles. At London  they forgave 70 per cent of the German interest payments. At that time the principal on that debt amounted to $1.5 billion or roughly $8 billion in today's terms.The same bold visionary leadership that condoned that debt also conceived the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Sank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The allies condoned 70 per cent of the interest payments of a defeated nation whose aggressiveness had already devastated half of Europe and shaken the world. In victory and in order to nip at conception another monstrous aggression  the allies forgave debt. In victory and for peace  anything was possible.Again  last week President Mitterrand said verbatim  that if Iraq were to withdraw from Kuwait  ""everything might become possible"". May we not claim the same possibility for countries guilty of no devastation and no invasion  guilty only at most of some improvidence in borrowings and in fiscal management? Did President Mitterrand mean to include the condemnation of their debt as one of the ""possible""?Before victory and in search of peace  before devastation even takes place  is it possible to be human and to speak of a tabula rasa. to give the world a fresh beginning? Only last Sunday we filled this historic Assembly Hall with Beads of State  Heads of Government and the children of the world. Children read in many tongues from the ringing Declaration of the Summit of the child.There was something that was not declared about the child of today which I now respectfully submit once more to the Assembly. The third world now owes $lo3 trillion. Therefore every child in that world is born not only  as some theologies profess  with original sin but also with original debt  up to $1 000 at the moment of birth  which at 10 per cent compounded interest reaches $7 000 at age 21. In this glorious year of the child is it not time to redeem the original debt of that child? The Philippines will not renege on its obligations  but neither will it cease to live up to its obligation to plead for universal justice."
"116",5634,"PNG",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Government and peopleof Papua New Guinea  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of theforty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that with your ableleadership and guidance the Assembly will deal with its work in a positive andconstructive manner. I also wish to place on record my country's appreciation ofthe contribution made by your predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria to the work of the Assembly last year.We acknowledge that the world of today is highly volatile and interdependent and the need for an organization such as the United Nations is more important todaythan ever before. New challenges are now being faced within the framework of theUnited Nations system. The United Nations  we believe  provide the appropriateforum  or the international community to solve problems through consultation anddialogue  without the need to resort to violence. The achievements  over theyears  of the United Nations system are commendable  particularly in the areas ofdisarmament  decolonisation  the environment  economic development  social justice and the maintenance of world peace. The United Nations can contribute further to international stability and social harmony  but this can occur only through goodwill and with the tolerance and understanding of all member nations. Papua New Guinea is committed to the United Nations and what it represents  and will continue to play its part in achieving world peace and harmony. Complex problems and challenges continue to face us this year  but the Assembly is convening at a time of great hope  a time of profound changes in relationships between nations. We have witnessed a marked improvement in East-West relations  particularly between the Super-Powers. The era of the cold war is vanishing  bringing hope  opportunity and  for some  uncertainty. Massive shifts in the world political order will invariably be reflected in changing economic relationships. We acknowledge with satisfaction the comprehensive report by the Secretary-General  particularly with regard to the United Nations involvement in the achievement of independence for Namibia and progress in negotiations for peaceful settlements of regional conflicts in Cambodia  Afghanistan  Western Sahara  Central America  South Africa and  more recently  the Persian Gulf. The report also addresses other pressing issues such as human rights  drugs  disarmament  the environment  trade  finance and debt servicing. Although major conflicts and tensions may appear to be peripheral to us in the South Pacific  we are not immune to their effects. We feel their impact on our economy  our international obligations  and our moral convictions. I speak today in full awareness of the international media publicity  both positive and adverse  that Papua New Guinea has attracted over the past two years. The increased activity in our petroleum and mining sectors  the closure of the Bougainville copper mine in May last year and the subsequent unrest in that province of our country have focused attention on Papua New Guinea. Unfortunately for Papua New Guinea  the Bougainville and law-and-order crises have tended to attract more attention than the many positive developments taking place in the country. Like many developing countries we have our share of problems  and we are addressing them with energy and determination. Initiatives have been taken by my government to promote economic growth  to further develop education and training opportunities  particularly in tertiary and technical areas  and to generate employment and income opportunities. At the same time. we are developing the capacity of the public service and strengthening law-enforcement agencies. As a result of the closure of Bougainville mine  my government  with the help of the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and other international and national aid agencies  has developed an integrated structural adjustment programme to assist Papua New Guinea through a difficult series of short-term problems. Among other things  the programme will ensure that major resources are progressively developed for the benefit of the country and its people. A first round of negotiations with Bougainville leaders produced an accord and the basis for the restoration of services by the national Government to that troubled island. My Government is committed to continued peaceful dialogue with the people of Bougainville that together we can achieve an amicable settlement of the crisis and a return to normalcy. The South Pacific Community is made up predominantly of small  island States  scattered throughout a vast ocean. For a long time our interests and well-being have been accorded the lowest priority by world military and economic Powers. We are vitally concerned about our region. Like others  we in the Pacific wish to develop under conditions of peace and security. Most Pacific nations depend on a small number of agricultural and marine products for their livelihood and export income. For these reasons we concluded the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty  The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific region  and the Convention for the Prohibition of Drift-net Fishing in the South Pacific. We therefore strongly deplore nuclear activities and the dumping of toxic waste   which threaten our fragile ecosystems. We also view with deep concern wanton exploitation of our resources. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It also ushers in the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Papua New Guinea urges that the progress of decolonisation should be accelerated and strengthened as part of the present favourable disposition surrounding the work of the United Nations. We are pleased that positive measures are continually being pursued in New Caledonia by the French authorities to provide a framework for a peaceful evolution of the Territory towards an act of self-determination and independence. We urge that any act of self-determination should be consistent with United Nationsprinciples and practices  and that all options  including independence  should be open.In order that a well-informed decision may be made  the Administering Authority and others should further expand their assistance for education and training  in particular for the Kanak population.  New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Therefore  it is incumbent upon the United Nations to continue tomonitor developments in New Caledonia. It is our express hope that the Administering Authority will facilitate regular visits to New Caledonia by inviting visiting missions of the United Nations. Apart from New Caledonia  there are other Pacific islands still under the shackles of colonialism. It is our hope that the Administering Authorities concerned will accord genuine self-determination to these countries. We in the Pacific have always been aware of the importance of protecting the environment. Indeed  the cultural and physical survival of many of our countries depends on the proper management of that environment. The Convention for the protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region  to which I referred earlier  is a clear indication of the importance we attach to this issue. We are greatly concerned that  in spite of ominous warnings about the future of this Earth  expected climatic changes and predictions of dramatic rises in the levels of the sea  gases responsible for the greenhouse effect continue to be emitted without strict regulation. It is our fervent hope that countries  particularly industrialized countries   will effect significant cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases  including the establishment of obligatory emission reduction standards. We continue to oppose the disposal of toxic waste at sea unless it conforms with standards Prescribed under the London dumping convention. The United States has taken stringent precautions in destroying chemical weapons on Johnston atoll. We take little comfort in suggestions that Johnston atoll should be the permanent disposal site for the American chemical weapons destruction programme. We urge the United States not to use the facility as a permanent site for the disposal of chemical weapons and toxic waste  and I express our firm belief that it should be closed done once the current operations have been completed. We will also continue strongly to oppose French nuclear testing at Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls. Pacific islanders have close affinity to the sea  and their dependence upon its resources needs no emphasis. Papua New Guinea is  therefore  pleased with the progress made on the elimination of driftnet fishing. We welcome the decision taken by Japan to cease drift netting a year in advance of the date stipulated in resolution 441225. We urge the Government of Japan and other distant water fishing nations to enter into negotiations with us on acceptable arrangements. Papua New Guinea's desire to participate meaningfully in the resolution of regional problems brings us into regular interaction with member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has taken many important initiatives  particularly in the South-East Asian region  which we have fully supported. We would like to acknowledge with satisfaction the leading role that both the Soviet Union and the United States have played  in recent years  to reduce tensions in the world. Their efforts and those of other States in the United Nations Security Council deserve our full support. Papua New Guinea is aware that progress made in the search for solutions to problems in Cambodia  Afghanistan  Western Sahara  the Middle East  the Korean peninsula and southern Africa is directly related to the convergence of views between the super-Powers and the permanent members of the Security Council. Papua new Guinea welcomes the announcement by Viet Nam to withdraw its troops completely from Cambodia. we commend the efforts of the ASEAN group of countries  Australia and the United Nations Security Council  in devising the united formula for the resolution of the Cambodian problem. Papua New Guinea believes that United nations involvement is necessary in order to ensure free and fair elections in Cambodia. In the Korean peninsula  my Government looks forward to the re-unification of North and South Korea. We support initiatives by both nations to reach a peaceful re-unification of Korean people  and urge them to continue on the path of reconciliation. In the same time  we support the admission of both North and South Korea to the United Nations as full Members. We believe this will facilitate dialogue and hasten the re-Unification process. The question of northern Sahara appears to be nearing resolution. The Secretary-General's settlement proposals  announced  on 11 August 1988  offer the chance to resolve this thorny issue once and for all. Members of the United Nations have a responsibility to see that the people of Western Sahara are able to exercise their right to self-determination. Thus  the organization and the supervision of a referendum by the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity must be allowed to take place. The situation in the Middle East continues to cause us grave concern. My Government has always maintained that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland  just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secure borders. These two conditions appear to be prerequisites if a lasting solution to this problem is to be achieved. We have strongly condemned the use of force as a means of solving disputes and  in this context  Papua New Guinea continues to be alarmed at and condemn Iraq's invasion and continued occupation of Kuwait since 2 August 1990. As a member of the United Nations  my Government is committed to supporting the trade and economic embargo against Iraq sponsored by the United Nations Security Council. We urge all members of this Assembly to continue to co-operate in seeking a peaceful solution to this crisis. My Government believes strongly that international pressure and sanctions have resulted in the gradual dismantling of the apartheid system. Developments in South Africa offer reason for guarded optimism. After years of oppression and injustice  the creation of a genuine non-racial democracy may at last be a real possibility. We have a continuing responsibility to encourage the process of reconciliation and democratic reconstruction. We are saddened by the recent riots in the black townships involving the rival groups of the African National Congress (ANC) and Zulu Inkatha movements  which have left so many people dead. It is our firm conviction that sanctions should be continued until apartheid is completely dismantled. Papua pew Guinea applauds the achievement of Namibia's independence and commends all patties who were involved in this exercise. There are many changes taking place in the world economy today. The move towards a single-market Europe in 1992  regional initiatives such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Group and the shift by Eastern European countries towards market-oriented economies have serious implications for developing countries. The continuing global economic recession have had a considerable adverse impact on the economic and social well-bring of all nations. Inflation  high interestrates  a change-rate instability  rising unemployment  slow growth andprotectionism have all taken their toll on our national economies. On a positive side  Eastern Europe's economic transition could offer new opportunities for developing economies through increased demand for their commodities. We believe that closer co-operation between developed and developing countries now are more important than ever. The benefits from new markets in Eastern Europe need to be evenly shared if open trading relations are to be maintained. The possible harmful impact on the financial resources available to the developing world must be minimised. The formation of the Asia-Pacific economic co-operation group is intended to develop closer co-operation between countries in the Asia-Pacific region  and also to accommodate developments taking place in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. The Lome IV Convention  which was signed on 15 December 1989  contains new concepts and ideas  which make it different from the three preceding arrangements. Lome IV contains increased financial packages for Africa  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries  and includes now provisions for structural adjustments and assistance to ACP countries facing severe balance-of-payments difficulties. It is of considerable importance to ACP countries that the levels of development assistance agreed to in Lome IV remain unaffected by the opening up of Eastern Europe's wider contacts in the rest of the world. Any adjustment or restructuring of the world trading and financial system must not adversely affect   the position of the developing countries. The shifting of focus as well as the diversion of financial resources for developed countries to Eastern Europe  would greatly disadvantage the economies of the developing countries  whose claims to a more equitable distribution of the world's resources have been outstanding for decades. It is important that an open world trading system be maintained if economic prosperity is to be distributed  fairly. A strengthened general Agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT) is essential if we are to provide a stable framework for the expansion of trade  and to make possible the full integration of Central and Eastern Europe  as well as developing countries  into the global economy. we believe that the highest priority on theinternational economic agenda is the need for a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of talks at the end of this year. Difficult political decisions will have to be taken in order to achieve far-reaching and substantive results from all the items to be discussed at the Uruguay round.  The remarkable political and economic changes that are taking place betweenthe super-powers in respect of Central and Eastern Europe  and those that are taking place in the Asia-Pacific region  the Middle East and elsewhere  point to the emergence of a new world order   with shifting alliances and economic groupings. Papua New Guinea is confident that the United Nations will address these issues and devise measures that will allow member States to cope with the uncertainties that lie ahead. We continue to support the United Nations in its unique role in the resolution of conflict  and in the building of a strong framework for international co-operation. Over the years we have supported the work of the United Nations because we believe it to be vital to the continuing development of a peaceful and prosperous world community. Finally  we assure you  Mr. President  and the Secretary-General of our continued support for efforts to maintain end develop the work of the United Nations."
"117",5680,"POL",45,1990,"Allow me  Sir  to add my congratulations on your election to the presidency of this important session. Let me also express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  our deep respect for his tireless service to the Organization. And it is with great pleasure that Poland welcomes Namibia and Liechtenstein in our midst. During the year that has elapsed since the last session we have witnessed the end of the cold war. The world has changed beyond recognition. However  we now face a novel danger: the armed conflict in the Gulf region  which constitutes an immense challenge to the delicate fabric of new global relationships. The key issue of the United Nations political strategy is the prevention of the use of any means  and particularly the use of force  against the existence and independence of any State. This includes the territorial integrity of States.I have used the term “key issue” because respect for the principles and rules I have mentioned is the premise of any international action and effort with a view to putting into effect the global goals and tasks of the organized international community. The United Nations will be unable to have even modest achievements in any of the basic areas of world co-operation if aggression goes unpunished  frontiers are violated and States are annexed.Therefore  in considering the effects of Iraqi aggression against Kuwait  we should realize that it is the very sense and the very purpose of our Organization that are at stake. We are at a critical moment. yet we have some reasons for optimism. One of them is there fact that the Security Council is  at last  in a position to exercise its lawful powers  which in the past had so often remained dormant in spite of international frictions and conflicts that called for resolute action. There has always been - but especially during recent years - much talk  inside and outside the Organization  about the adaptation of structures and methods at the United Nations. In the case of the Iraqi war against Kuwait  the Organization was able to put the powers inscribed in the Charter to their proper use. Allow me to quote the distinguished French jurist the late Judge Guy de Lacharriere  who  discussing the problem of changes in the Organization  rightly asked: “Would not the application of the Charter be the most important reform?”. This is what is in progress now and it should be supported as our standard procedure. If an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations  the Charter  including its Article 51  gives ample room for action aimed at restoring State independence and existing frontiers. Another reason for satisfaction is the international response to the Security Council resolutions dealing with the Iraqi aggression.Poland is implementing them fully and will take any further action that might be ordered or authorized by the Security Council. We have prevented imports from and exports to Iraq and occupied Kuwait  and we have taken other measures in conformity with the Security Council decisions. It should be noted that Polish companies and enterprises have lost a lot of business through the interruption of trade with Iraq and Kuwait. Our support for  and participation in  the United Nations actions has cost us  as of today  $570 million  and we expect this sum to increase at the end of the year to $1.4 billion. These losses come at a moment which is crucial to our economic reform  and they are serious blow to our national effort.However  I think that certain national and international values cannot be assessed by reference to any measurable or calculable price. They should be fostered and cherished whatever the cost. Without them we lose any sense of purpose. One such value is solidarity among men and women in both national and international dimensions. During the past decade the concept and the ethics of solidarity have had an unusual impact on public life in Poland  and this in spite of the obvious counterweight created by the realities of everyday politics. I think that by introducing solidarity as the basic notion of public activity  Poles have shown that in our world of unlimited egoism  violence  and the incredible richness of some and the inhuman deprivations and humiliating poverty of others  there is a better road ahead. The Polish idea and practice of solidarity has had its international impact by contributing to the creation of circumstances propitious to the great event of our time: the fall of totalitarianism in Europe and the resulting unification of Germany. On the day of unification  the Polish nation extends its best wishes and its cordial thoughts to the German nation and looks forward to the forging of a community of interests with its western neighbor. Of course  there is a real need for new regional arrangements  and especially one that would respond to the lessons of the present crisis in the Persian Gulf.Indeed  Poland regrets that up till now the conflict could not have been resolved by peaceful means within the family of Arab nations. With that family  we have always had friendly relations and various ties  and we wish to maintain them  provided the international rule of law is respected.For these reasons  bearing in mind its relations with Islam in past centuries  and  obviously  being aware of the fact that the present is different from the past  Poland supports the working out of stable and far-sighted policies towards the Arab countries  and generally the Islamic countries - I refer to policies of States participating in the Helsinki process.However  the more immediate answer today lies in the application of the United Nations Charter. The problem  politically and economically  is global. here we come to the international dimension of solidarity  that is solidarity among peoples and nations. In this spirit  Poland has decided to participate in the multinational effort and to send a hospital ship and a field hospital to the Gulf area.In condemning aggression and occupation we must also remember that other violations of international law have taken place. The law prohibits the taking of hostages in whatever form this might happen. Human rights of foreign nationals in Iraq and in occupied Kuwait should be vindicated. Let me  finally  say that in our eyes Kuwait continues to exist as a State  in spite of the invasion and in spite of what has happened after it. It is a rule of both United Nations law and general international law that: “No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.” (resolution 2625 (XXV)  annex  para. 1)The Republic of Poland adheres to the primacy of the rule of law in inter-State relations. It is with deep satisfaction that I have listened to the words of Mr. Francois Mitterrand  President of the French Republic  on the rule of law in the international community. I subscribe to those words. The United Nations Decade of International Law should enhance the rule of international law and encourage the progressive development and codification of that law. During the Decade  more attention should be focused on the important work of the International Law Commission and on the extent to which it fulfills its mandate. The Commission should not engage in topics and discussions which rather belong to the academic field. It should take up the gray legal issues of our time  and at the same time it should elaborate specific law-making treaties on problems promoting the regulation of such issues. In that task there is also room for the Commission’s co-operation with other international agencies. Protection of the environment is a case in point. Within the Assembly the role of the Sixth Committee should be enhanced. In particular  both the International Law Commission and the Sixth Committee could have a part in the Assembly procedures whenever the Assembly intends to adopt a law-declaring or law-influencing resolution. Generally  the present role of the Sixth Committee is too static.One of the safeguards of the rule of law is the functioning of international tribunals. Even the most acute political disputes have their legal aspects  and they can be resolved by judicial bodies. Such settlement no doubt relieves tension and contributes to the elimination of conflicts among States where classical diplomacy proved has impotent. The present considerable number of cases brought before the International Court of Justice at the Hague augurs well for States’ respect for law. As promised last year in this Hall  Poland has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Hague Court. Poland supports the idea of establishing an international criminal court or other mechanism with jurisdiction over persons. Poland attaches great importance to the protection of human rights as a factor in the preservation of peace and democracy. We shall soon adhere to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We have accepted the competence of the Human Rights Committee under article 41 of that Covenant. We are prepared to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and to develop further the human dimension of the Helsinki process. We are considering joining the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.Poland has been actively engaged in work on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. A few days ago the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament  the Diet  adopted a law authorizing the Head of State to ratify the Convention. The developments of the past year have reaffirmed the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping. Co-operation among many States  including the permanent members of the Security Council  has enabled the United Nations to carry out those responsibilities. Poland has made a contribution to peacekeeping efforts. More than 16 000 Polish soldiers have served under the United Nations flag in the course of the past 17 years. Poland is ready to continue to participate in peace-keeping operations. Poland supports the plan on Cambodia and declares its readiness to join the international mechanism envisaged for the implementation of that plan. In that context  it is worth while recalling that the United Nations definition of peace is not negative: According got the Charter  peace does not mean the mere absence of armed conflict. In this increasingly interdependent world  it would be an oversimplification to see military conflicts  nationalism and armaments as the only threats to our common security. The disparity between rich countries and poor countries  between abundance and poverty  is another fundamental challenge to the United Nations. The absence of growth in developing countries  massive migration  low living standards which encourage drug trafficking and violence  acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  transboundary industrial pollution: all of these are threats confronting mankind.  A new deal consisting of debt reduction  technology transfer  credit lines  direct investment and access to markets seems to be the answer for countries caught in a vicious circle of retrogression  sociopolitical instability and financial crisis. External indebtedness stands in the forefront. In our view  there is an urgent need for imaginative debt reduction  including schemes aimed at preventing further polarization between creditors and debtors and at reintegrating debtors into the world economy and world trade. Another vital question relates to the environment. His Excellency Mr. Fernando Color  President of the Federative Republic of Brazil  has just made inspiring comments on that question. I should like to refer also to the views just expressed on that problem by Her Excellency Mrs. Danielle de St. Jorre  Minister for Planning and Foreign Affairs of Seychelles. The growing interdependence between economic development and the environment should always be present in our minds. Poland welcomes the Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992. The recent Conference of Baltic States  held at Ronneby  Sweden  was a good example of the regional approach to the problem. Many countries have suffered heavy losses as a result of the present conflict in the Gulf area. His Excellency Mr. Francois Mitterrand included that problem in his four-point proposal. We should create an international mechanism whereby the additional proceeds of oil exporters would be transferred in part to those oil-importing countries which have suffered acutely as a result of the conflict. Finally  I wish to say a few words about the changes in Central and Eastern Europe. The one-party system  with its unworkable  centrally planned - or rather misplanned - economy  has given way to parliamentary democracy and the market economy as two interconnected factors. Political freedom and economic reform cannot live without each other. The resistance to totalitarianism in my country  as an expression of the longing for freedom  dignity and independence  led to the rise of the Solidarity trade union. The Solidarity trade union rejected the use of force  yet the movement for reform was victorious. The process thus started has now become irreversible  despite hardships inherent in the transition. Poles as a nation and Poland as a State have become sovereign again. We speak with our own voice and have taken our future back into our own hands. The legacy of Yalta has thus been relegated to history. The once bipolar world is becoming a multipolar world where the notion of East and West is losing  at any rate politically  all relevance other than geographical relevance.The transition to a market economy in Central and Eastern Europe is coupled with a structural readjustment. There should be a substantial reduction of debt  a comprehensive technical and capital aid package and improved access to markets. Such a program might draw on the ideas of the Marshall Plan. A year ago  after a long period of economic stagnation  Poland embarked upon the difficult road to a market economy  at the cost of unemployment  temporary recession and the ensuing decline in living standards. Primarily  the transition is our own responsibility. None the less  when the success of unprecedented evolution and peaceful change is at stake along with the stability of our part of Europe  external support may prove critical. As th apolitical rift in Europe fades away  it would be an all too great mistake to allow economic divisions to be consolidated.Mr. President  a few days ago in a newspaper interview you rightly said that previously  political ideologies had wrecked the functioning of the Organization. We are now  I hope  entering an era in which ideologies will be less and less vocal in international politics and in which the role of the ideological factor in relations among States will be greatly reduced and will disappear. We welcome that development. It should enhance the significance of international morality. Her Excellency Mrs. Danielle de St. Jorre just referred  very pertinently  to morality. The presence of morality will  I am sure  prove to be the strongest stabilizing element at a time when the United Nations has become more credible. "
"118",5751,"PRT",45,1990,"﻿I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  and to express Portugal's confidence in your high personal skills  which will help guarantee the positive results expected of this session.I would also like to convey my country's appreciation for the effective Manner in which Mr. Joseph Garba discharged the important functions of President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.With the notably greater role played by the United Nations on the· international scene  particular mention is also certainly duo to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for all he has done to bolster continued and successful efforts for world peace and development.In the past year  profound world-wide changes have taken place. I especially welcome the delegation of Namibia  whose presence in this General Assembly attests to the fundamental role played by the United Nations in the process which led to that country's independence.I also welcome Liechtenstein as a new Member of the United Nations  whose contribution to international co-operation is highly appreciated.	We are witnessing a far-reaching unfolding of events in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and an acceleration in the pace of history  which is leading to the unification of Germany and making the observance of the principles of democracy and the respect for human rights a living reality throughout the European continent.Today  the end of the cold war  the consequent detente in East-West relations  disarmament and the new formulas to achieve co-operation - all these are decisive factors of strategic importance. An emerging multipolar world  however  entails the risk of proliferation of regional conflict. And just recently  the principles that ought to govern the freedoms of the peoples and the sovereignty of the Member States  such as international law and the Charter of the United Nations itself  were brutally violated when Iraq  in an irresponsible act  occupied Kuwait.The response of the international community was an exemplary one  as demonstrated by the unanimous decision of the Security Council  which immediately condemned the invasion and annexation  and subsequently imposed an embargo. Peace and security must rely on full compliance  on the part of all nations  with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and it is urgent to enforce strict observance of law and legitimacy and to restore full sovereignty to Kuwait.Portugal  both at the national level and within the framework of a co-ordinated effort in the European Community  the Western European Union and the United Nations  will continue to support all endeavours aiming at the total withdrawal of Iraqi military forces from its occupied neighbour.We also think that the United Nations resolutions must be fully complied with and  if necessary  that further measures should be taken by the Security Council. We favour a peaceful solution to the conflict  which can only be possible with an attitude of determination and the respect of principles on the part of the whole international community.It is my conviction that the crisis that has broken out in the Gulf with the military occupation of Kuwait will not affect the climate of world-wide understanding and dialogue that is being established throughout the world  as demonstrated recently at the Helsinki summit meeting  by the positive changes occurring in Central and Eastern Europe  the developments in southern Africa and the real progress made in the field of disarmament. Portugal has tried to contribute to this new climate  in the European and world contests. Changes in the East European countries and consequent acceptance of the fundamental values of democracy and rule of law made it possible for the Government of Portugal to host  last March in Lisbon  within the framework of the Council of Europe  the first meeting of all the foreign ministers of Europe. I trust that the spirit of dialogue which prevailed will be strengthened.Moreover  Portugal is participating fully in the political co-operation within the Twelve  thus reinforcing its capacity to take part in world affairs.Likewise  we are committed to contributing to European integration in the political  economic  financial and social fields. The reinforcement of the Community's mechanisms of intervention will contribute to a gradual strengthening of a European identity and will translate into a renewed factor of security and stability  not only for the European continent  but also for the world as a whole.I would stress  in this context  the forthcoming unification of Germany  a process that reflects not only the current positive evolution in the political and military situation in Central and Eastern Europe  but also the persevering will of the German people and the strong commitment of all Western allies to the task of safeguarding the values of freedom and human rights.All these changes have led to the development of novel strategies for the Atlantic Alliance  which remains a factor of importance to Western cohesion.On the European continent  other factors are indicating a renewed confidence and hope in the future  as in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The 35 States participating in CSCE were able to create the conditions for new schemes of co-operation  straightforward relations and freedom of movement that will prove of great benefit to the individual. To that end  the maintenance of ties with the United States and Canada are indispensable to the building up of security in the future Europe.A most promising outcome of the new climate in East-West relations is the progress made in the current negotiations at different levels for a substantial and balanced reduction in armaments between the two super-Powers and among military alliances in Europe. Portugal supports the efforts towards a reduction of United States and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons as well as the negotiations that are taking place in Vienna with a view to reducing conventional forces in the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. The outcome of these talks will be an important factor for stability and confidence in Europe. My country deems equally very important every endeavour for a total ban on the manufacture and possession of chemical weapons  and we call for strict compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and for speedy accession to it by those countries which are not yet signatories.I believe that a new world outlook  made possible by the rapid evolution of history and by detente  requires that efforts for establishing a basis of confidence and stability include greater co-operation in multiple domains  the kind of co-operation that has as its main goal the peaceful development and progress of mankind.Portugal is definitely committed to the building of a new Europe but  for historical reasons  it maintains close relations with other peoples and continents.Before the end of this century  we will celebrate 500 years of the Portuguese discoveries in Africa  the Americas and Asia  which are the symbol par excellence of the encounter of different cultures and civilisations. By bringing various peoples together  introducing the most varied cultural expressions to one another and establishing the principles of international sea trade  we made a decisive contribution to redrawing the map of the world. We have today special ties with Portuguese-speaking countries and communities around the world. These preferential relations  with Brazil and with African countries that have Portuguese as their official language  are historical factors  but they are  above all  elements of political  economic and cultural interaction  mutually beneficial  which contribute to international stability. The group formed by the five Portuguese-speaking African countries is today a reality and one more intervening factor in Africa to be reckoned with  when the destiny of the continent is being shaped; furthermore  these countries now assume decisive positions in the process of political democracy  economic liberalisation and respect for human rights and liberties in Africa.I should like to make a special reference  as an expression of hope  to the ongoing process of negotiations in which the peoples of Angola and Mozambique are at present involved  in the search for peaceful solutions  political stability and economic and social progress  that can  I am sure  put an end to the war and to their suffering.My Government is committed to the success of the negotiations that are taking place between the parties in the conflicts  because only peace can help the peoples of Angola and Mozambique fully to express themselves. In particular  I am convinced that  if all the parties display realism and flexibility  it will be possible to arrive soon at peaceful solutions.We are also following with interest the political and social developments in the Republic of South Africa  which is home to a significant Portuguese community. My Government supports the efforts by President De Klerk  Nelson Mandela and other South African leaders towards the attainment  through dialogue  of constitutional solutions guaranteeing respect for the fundamental rights and liberties of all South Africans. That dialogue will bring about the abolition of apartheid  the democratisation of South African society and the access of all to the benefits of progress.The recent independence of Namibia constitutes a historical fact which can foster a much-desired stability in southern Africa.Within the framework of its foreign policy  Portugal gives special importance to co-operation for development  including preferential relations with countries and peoples with which it has historic and cultural links. The enhancement of this co-operation has been possible because it rests on respect for the sovereignty of other States and on the excellent  straightforward political relationship it enjoys with the established Governments of Portuguese-speaking nations.The international community has an ethical obligation of solidarity with those countries which are experiencing difficult economic situations  and it should try to find appropriate solutions. I should like to affirm the support of my country  within its means  for all multilateral initiatives that will help ameliorate such situations  especially in the case of the least developed countries.The problem of the foreign debt should be the focus of particular attention  as it constitutes a major obstacle to economic development and to the improvement of peoples' standards of living. The solution can be found only in new and imaginative initiatives that are not harmful to economic growth  and this requires the concerted efforts of the international community  so that urgent steps can be taken to resolve this serious situation.An essentially Atlantic nation  Portugal is naturally endowed for the dialogue with other continents  and it has important communities in Europe  in Africa  in Brazil and in numerous other Latin American countries  as well as in Asia and Australia. These Portuguese communities are an important factor in the strengthening of our relations with other countries. I should like to single out Brazil  since the Portuguese settlers and their descendants in that country share with us а common language and centuries-old history making our relations especially fraternal. The vitality of the Portuguese community and the geographic and economic relevance of Brazil and the ties that bind us to that nation explain the uniqueness of our relationship.Portugal acknowledges that dialogue and close communication with the People's Republic of China are essential to the stability and progress of Macao and its population. Macao  a link between the Portuguese and China  is an example of long-tem peaceful relations  which  I am sure  will remain intact after the transfer of the administration of the territory by the end of 1999.The international community is the main beneficiary of the current trend  thanks to which the United Nations has actually been able to start carrying out the tasks and fulfilling the hopes expressed more than four decades ago by its founders. As we approach the end of this century  however  there are still matters that require urgent and concerted action.I am referring  in the first instance  to the Arab-Israeli conflict  to which a solution can be found only through an unequivocal recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people  along with indispensable assurances of security for all the States in the region.Latin America has experienced serious problems regarding stability and violation of human rights  in addition to economic shortcomings. There are  however  signs of the strengthening of democratic institutions and a greater awareness of the importance of the process of regional integration  which deserve the active support of the international community.My government also lends its support to the United Nations efforts towards finding peaceful solutions for the present conflicts in Western Sahara and Cambodia.The assistance of a climate more conducive to resolving conflicts that have dragged on for years provides an opportunity of which the international community should take advantage to its fullest. As an example  the dialogue in which the two Koreas are currently engaged  as well as their eventual membership in the Unite'Nations  constitutes a major stabilising factor for that region of the world.The fundamental rights and freedoms of the peoples must not be handled in a selective or discretionary way. The use of double standards in the application of essential principle  can lead to inconsistent action and to tolerance of potential violators and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The international community cannot endorse conquest by force or territorial gains won by blatant military invasion with the intent of imposing a policy of fait accompli.In the case of the invasion and occupation of East Timor  non-compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  combined with accommodation to a de facto situation  has set a grave international precedent - unfortunately  a precedent given further credence by the invasion and annexation of Kuwait.Portugal has systematically called the attention of the international community to the need for respect for the rights of the East Timorese people  as well as for their cultural and religious identity. We act in accordance with the responsibility incumbent upon us  recognised by the United Nations  in conformity with its Charter and pertinent principles and resolutions. It is for my country a moral  historic and constitutional imperative - based on the unanimous consensus of all our political parties - to defend  by all legitimate means  the rights of the people of East Timor  particularly the right to self-determination and to its identity as a people. One cannot expect Portugal to refrain from strongly denouncing the systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Timorese  which continue to occur  according to reports from unbiased and reliable sources.Portugal has been completely .open to dialogue and to the search for a negotiated solution with all the parties directly involved  in accordance with resolution 37 30. We have co-operated closely with the Secretary-General in his mediation efforts to achieve that goal. I should like to reiterate  unequivocally  our willingness to pursue that co-operation  in order to achieve an internationally acceptable  just and comprehensive solution. Only this could bring real peace to the martyred people of East Timor and allow them to voice their concerns; otherwise their legitimate rights are not respected.The efforts of the Organization must be felt in various domains  with particular relevance for human rights. Everything should be done to achieve general compliance and observance of the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Sights.The growing interdependence among nations and continents has taken on an important dimension and significance  particularly with regard to the protection of the environment. Problems in this area are frequently global  and  therefore  it is urgent that all participants take responsibility for a joint solution.The drug problem is another world scourge to which no country is immune at the present time. An effective weapon against drug trafficking on an international scale is therefore a priority  and only appropriate international co-operation can successfully carry out this struggle in defence of human dignity.The growing number of refugees resulting from the various conflicts or natural disasters presents another challenge that requires co-ordinated and effective joint efforts by the international community as a whole. Relaxing East-West tensions should not make us forget that there are serious structural imbalances between the various countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It should be the task of the international economic bodies and the richer countries to adopt measures and programmes to help effect the transition to a multiparty democracy and a market economy in the countries that abandoned authoritarian systems of planned economy of their own free will.We have followed and supported the political and economic reforms under way in the Soviet Union  -which are a testimony to President Gorbachev's realism and an important contribution to the new world climate.Portugal has alerted its partners to the importance of proper and sympathetic handling of North-South relations  since the contrasts at the level of economic growth and welfare and political stability are notoriously deep-seated and tend to increase in an alarming way  generating regional conflicts or serious political and social destabilisation.	The initiative that I proposed within the framework of the Council of Europe for the creation  in Lisbon  of a centre for global interdependence and solidarity has begun to take shape. I consider it to be indispensable for us to arrive at a genuine contract of solidarity between the countries of the North and the South to attain a harmonious and comprehensive development of all the regions of the world  without which there can be no true stability and security.Today there are 180 million people that speak Portuguese. They live in seven countries on three continents  and in numerous communities all over the world. The universalism and tolerance that characterise our history and our culture are at the basis of Portuguese foreign policy and explain our vocation for establishing ties with other peoples.I should like to conclude with a word of praise for the United Nations and its successful pursuit of the most noble aspirations of mankind. Today  the speed and dynamics of history do not allow solutions that might jeopardise peace  security and development. I therefore believe that the United Nations initiatives should be reinforced  since it is only within the framework of this Organisation that we can find the universal formulas that are needed to create a more secure  stable and prosperous world - the world that we all share."
"119",5797,"PRY",45,1990,"﻿At the outset I should like to congratulate the President on his election to his high office at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Because of his great intellectual and moral qualities we are convinced he will be able to conduct our work with the utmost competence and resolve.We extend the greetings of our Government to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  and express our satisfaction at his excellent performance with regard to the task entrusted to him.We also wish to join with those delegations that have expressed satisfaction at the admission to membership in the United Nations of the principality of Liechtenstein and the Republic of Namibia. We have come to this forum convinced of the continuing validity of the major purposes and principles set forth in the Charter. The important changes that have taken place in the world make it possible to predict an era of peace and good will among people and of increased understanding between the super-Powers and co-operation  and assistance among all nations.In this international context the United Nations is acquiring new importance as a forum for the co-ordination of national and regional activities and as an instrument indispensable to world peace and security. The work done by the Security Council has been essential to the strengthening of the Organisation  and its recent action has reaffirmed the need for multilateralism.The Republic of Paraguay shares and fully supports the thrust of the Security Council resolutions clearly and categorically condemning the invasion of Kuwait and adopting measures to deter the aggression.The rights of independence  territorial integrity and free exercise of sovereignty by a State are essential to the very existence of the international legal order. Without full and complete respect for such rights  peace among the community of nations is inconceivable. For that reason Paraguay has not only publicly condemned that aggression against a Member State of our Organization but  in strict compliance with the provisions adopted by the Security Council  also has taken measures we have already reported. We take this opportunity to encourage the Secretary-General to undertake new efforts to solve the conflict within the framework of the United Nations.Paraguay  which has always had very close links of co-operation with the Federal Republic of Germany  cannot fail to express its satisfaction with the decision of the German States to reunite in a single great nation. We hail the trend towards the normalization of internal relations in the Republic of South Africa and we support any reform which  with the consent of the various sectors that stake up South African society  will lead to the full integration of all of its citizens without discrimination.We note with concern that solution of the problem of the Middle East .is not yet within the grasp of the Organization. Paraguay will endorse any initiative that will lead to the peaceful solution of the differences separating the peoples of Israel and the Arab States and that takes account of the Palestinian people's right to its own homeland and the State of Israel's right to live in peace within its own borders.Signs of a possible negotiated end to the long-standing conflict in Cambodia have been strengthened by the decisions of the parties to accept a peace plan and a broad solution with the help of the United Nations. Paraguay is pleased to support those steps and urges the parties concerned to take advantage of this historic opportunity for peace and reconciliation for the Cambodian people.We also wish to take this opportunity to express our Government's solidarity with the constant efforts of the Republic of Korea to achieve through dialogue reconciliation of the Korean people in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We hope that in the near future the people of Korea will be represented in our midst.The question of disarmament continues to be a priority issue for our Organization. The new climate of confidence and dialogue established between the super-Powers gives us hope that part of the resources used for the production of armaments can be redirected towards helping development. Peace and security can be achieved only by taking the needs of people into account and considering the causes and sources of violence. Given the dimensions of various world problems  we are all very much aware of the dangers of nuclear confrontation. The need to give full effect to human rights and fundamental freedoms has been one of the main concerns of the democratic Government of my country established after the elections of 1 May 1989. Political will has made it possible for our country to be counted among those States Members of the Organisation that fully respect human rights. My country's Government is making great efforts to adapt its legislation so that it may be among the most advanced in this respect and to disseminate fundamental principles in order to train its people in knowledge of a respect for human rights. To that end we are being assisted by the Organisation. For the first time  with the co-operation of the United Nations  we held a seminar on human rights last July. Our national Government attaches the greatest importance to the well-being of children and therefore welcomed with satisfaction news of the convening of a United Nations summit conference at which practical measures can be discussed and decisions adopted with a view to solving problems affecting children. On the national level end in our bilateral relations  specific measures are being adopted to strengthen our country's legal and institutional instruments in order to control the illicit production and traffic of dangerous drugs more effectively. At the same time  co-operation programmes are being established within the legal framework of the agreements we have recently signed with neighbouring countries and with the United States for more effective joint action. Along the same lines  Paraguay ratified the United Nations Convention against illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.We believe that in our country and the world at large  tangible progress has been made in the struggle against the illegal traffic and consumption of drugs. We will continue our struggle to ensure that by educating our youth and creating better social conditions  the consumption of drugs will no longer be attractive. Our Government  committed to a better future for mankind  is bent on helping to adopt all measures to preserve our natural resources for future generations  and expresses its determination to adopt and implement all measures necessary towards that end.In 1992  500 years after its discovery  America will once again express its hopes for a better world for humanity when the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development is held in Brazil. Thirty years ago  in 1960  we launched the first United Nations Development Programme and we prepared an action strategy. Nevertheless  the problems of the developing countries are far from being solved. We still have serious obstacles to the expansion of our trade. Instead of a growing transfer of resources from the industrialized nations to our countries  the opposite is true. The prices of our commodities are declining in real terms and all our efforts to capitalize are thus fruitless. Technical assistance and the transfer of technology assists countries of average development  which need it most  our ever-dwindling financial resources and external debt are some of our problems that seem unsolvable or only partially solvable.We are fully convinced that it is indispensable to deal with the social and economic problems of our international society in a global fashion by adopting measures that will effectively change the very structure of the world economy  thus creating a new  more just international economic order. No future strategy can have definitive results if it does not include structural reforms.With the end of the East-West conflict we can conceive of a community of nations investing all its strengths in a new type of struggle  in which North and South  united in common ideals  will strive to put an end to the main causes of human suffering» We aspire to a world of integration  co-operation  assistance for development  and not merely a world of peaceful coexistence.For Paraguay integration is a comprehensive factor for development as the best political and economic means to achieve a future for Latin America. That is why we have accepted an invitation to participate in a process begun by Argentina and Brazil  and also involving Chile and Uruguay. Paraguay's pro-integration position is expressed not only in the declaration of principles set forth in our national Constitution  but also in our deeply rooted links with our neighbours on the American continent  both in commercial enterprises such as power-generation and infrastructure  as well as in joint efforts such as the Paraguay-Parana waterway. We hope that this decade will be known in America as the decade of integration  and we are sure that it will benefit our peoples. America must comply with the historic mandate of unity.President Bush's America’s initiative has been welcomed by the countries of the hemisphere  and expresses the spirit of unity and continental solidarity and the intention the Government of the United States to help developing countries. In that respect  the countries of the South American common market region have adopted a joint position with regard to arriving at a specific agreement with the United States Government.Since the advent of democracy  a freely elected Government was established in my country under the leadership of President Andres Rodriguez  with full respect for human rights and legitimacy. One of our first tasks has been the reform of legal and institutional instruments  allowing us to ensure full exercise of democracy in our country. We can thus point to the repeal of repressive laws; the adoption by our National Congress of a new electoral code incorporating Paraguay's legislation in institutions appropriate to modern participatory democracy; the convening in 1991 of the first direct municipal elections in the history of Paraguay; and the restoration of a sincere climate of tolerance and dialogue in our country between all political parties  without ideological prejudice. We have respect and guarantees for the right of assembly. Workers' associations are free to express themselves through trade unions  and there are no political prisoners in our country. In the economic sphere  the Government has accepted the responsibility of redressing the country's imbalances by adopting the necessary economic  financial  monetary and exchange policies.The solution to some problems makes it possible to solve other problems that were overshadowed by the first. The major political and economic reforms that allow us to see a new Paraguay  one filled with hope for greater well-being and happiness  have made it possible to better appreciate the existence of problems that the national Government is today determined to resolve. For that  we need the co-operation and understanding of the United Nations and of friendly nations at a higher level of development.The major changes that are taking place in the world reaffirm our faith in the destiny of mankind. With the fall of walls and the opening of borders  humanity is moving towards a future in which it can exercise its inalienable rights. The changes that have occurred  in America and Europe in particular  constitute above all a triumph of liberty and the right of people to choose their own future and to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.America  our America  is experiencing a unique time of democratically elected governments that answer to the demands of the people and have begun to move towards integration. America would like to have a single homeland  the fulfilment of its hopes and dreams.We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations. It will continue to be the primary instrument to preserve world peace and  above all  to guarantee the liberties  independence and integrity of peoples and nations  enforce the law  and achieve acceptance of the solution to all disputes."
"120",5862,"QAT",45,1990,"﻿Allow me  Sir  to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your election is a recognition by all of your extensive experience in the affairs of the United Nations and of the important role played by Malta  your country  in the international community. We have every confidence that you will carry out the responsibilities of your high office with the ability and efficiency for which you are known. I also wish to extend my thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria  and commend the objectivity and efficiency with which he conducted the deliberations of the previous session of the General Assembly.I should also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  and commend his ceaseless efforts in the interests of peace and the settlement of international conflicts. His continuous and persistent search for solutions to those conflicts entrench the principle of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means set out in the Charter of the United Nations with a view to establishing international relations on peace and security.My country appreciates these efforts and extends to him its full support in line with its previous policy of supporting the Organization and upholding its principles  believing in its mission of establishing international peace and security on the strong bases of truth and justice and of mutual understanding and brotherhood among all nations  great and small  rich and poor.I take this opportunity to welcome  in the name of my country  the reunification of Germany  which will contribute to the cause of peace.We meet in this regular session  at a time when the international community faces extraordinary circumstances it has not been faced with since the Second World War. I speak to you with my heart full of grief because the current crisis constitutes a deep rift in the structure of our Arab house; a rift that not only puts the entire house in unthinkable danger  but also threatens  as never before  the security and safety of the whole world. The flagrant Iraqi invasion of peaceful Kuwait took the world by surprise. It is an event so grave that it has destroyed the concept of Arab concord  created a new division among Arab countries and added a new artificial problem to the problems already existing for which the Arab States were working together to find solutions. Moreover  this invasion runs counter to international law and custom and to the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter and those of the Charter of the League of Arab States. It all happened so unexpectedly that it defied all the reasonable norms that should govern international relations among the nations of the world  let alone the States that are linked by brotherly neighbourliness and close bonds of faith  heritage  purpose and common destiny  as in the case of all Arab States.Before the invasion  the Arab Gulf States were seeking wholeheartedly to establish the basis for an Arab system in the region that would provide its peoples with economic and social security and serve as a component of a broader and more comprehensive Arab security within the framework of the international security system.Since the inception of the Arab Gulf States Co-operation Council  its leaders have been persistent in their striving after those noble goals. Then  suddenly  came the Iraqi aggression against the State of Kuwait to thwart all those efforts end disrupt  God knows for how long  the work towards the establishment of a stable system for the security of the Gulf States  the Arabs and the world.The world of today is not the world of great and medium States alone but also of small States which enjoy  under the Charter of the United Nations  the same sovereignty as the others  have the same privileges and assume the same responsibilities without distinction between great and small States. Our world today is brimful of manifestations of co-operation among nations  great and small  reflected in regional groupings  common markets and customs unions and  above all  in the United Nations itself.Therefore  the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait constitutes a deviation from the standard conception of the international community structure and turns the wheel of history back to ancient times when strong States used to devour their smaller neighbours and with impunity erase them from the map of the world. Those days have gone forever and the world can no longer tolerate such aggression.Today all nations  great and small  equally denounce and condemn aggression and demand the elimination of its consequences. In fact  the special responsibilities of the super-Powers make them duty-bound to set a good example for others until truth and justice prevail so that all  great and small  might live in the comfort of peace and security.In the welter of the thick dark night that has fallen on our region and the world since August  a ray of hope appears through a prompt international and regional and swift response both to this brutal aggression. The international community  regardless of its differences  was able to take a unified  clear and firm stand regarding the Iraqi invasion of the trusting and peaceful State of Kuwait  which used to participate wholeheartedly  and with fruitful commitment  in all fields of international co-operation at both regional and global levels.The world has unanimously rejected the aggression and its consequences  demanded that it should be removed  all its consequences eliminated and that everything should be as it was before the aggression took place.This unanimous international stand which became crystallised so quickly and effectively  is the first of its kind in modern times. It is  perhaps  a sign of the emergence of a new world order in which all contradictions and polarizations will disappear; where all the States of the world would work hand in hand to maintain universal peace and security as was envisioned by the authors of the Charter.On the Arab level  resolutions adopted by the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council and by the League of Arab States  have been circulated to members as official documents of the United Nations. Those resolutions are an expression of the denunciation of the Arab world of this grave event that shook the foundations of its existence  since it was a flagrant violation of the Charter of the League of Arab States which provides for respect for the territorial integrity of its Member States and for their independent existence. Accordingly  the States in our region have exercised their legitimate rights and have taken all the necessary measures to protect their sovereignty and defend their security in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.Those Arab resolutions are similar in content and spirit to the eight resolutions adopted  on a world level  by the Security Council  as a clear expression of international legitimacy and the noble principles of the Charter  especially the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for the territorial integrity of all States and the non-use of force in international relations.The Security Council resolutions clearly and strongly express what ray country expects from the international community  that is a rejection of aggression and a firm resolve to eliminate all its consequences by using all means available to the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter until this serious threat to international peace and security vanishes from the world horizon  and until the principles of right and justice and the rule of law in international relations has been established.World events  especially the moat recent ones  have underlined the pivotal role of the Organisation in dealing with international problems and in asserting the Organisation's principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter  which determine the framework for co-operation and mutual understanding among Member States  demand respect for the sovereignty and independence of States  and call upon nations to live together in an atmosphere free from fear and intimidation. The Organisation therefore has become an indispensable and effective instrument of multilateral diplomacy  which has proved to be the only way to deal with the world's political  economic and social problems we are facing today.It is promising that we have seen in our world the emergence of international détente  particularly between the super-Powers. We have also witnessed the end of the cold war and we have seen political changes in a number of countries  which are two factors that are considered to be a decisive step for the future of humanity.However  we need to remind ourselves that the reality of the situation is not as it seems. There are still problems in certain regions of the world that require speedy solutions. Hence  it would only be right to say that the solution of those problems requires international co-operation and that the role of the United Nations would be inevitable in promoting such co-operation.We have to recognise that no matter how much optimism prevails in the world  humanity will never enjoy peace and safety until the chronic problems have been solved  in particular the Palestinian problem  which has been on the agenda of the General Assembly since its inception.The strange thing with regard to the Palestinian question is that while the world moves in one direction the Arab-Israeli conflict moves in a different direction  that is fraught with tension and confrontation  despite the tens of resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly confirming the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  and despite the continuing struggle waged by the Palestinian people in defence of its rights and its dignity with the support of all the nations of the world. We salute the intifadah of the Palestinian people and give our total support to its struggle and its hopes that this struggle will bear fruit so that this people may attain its right of self- determination  as have other peoples in the world. Israel  however  still persists in ignoring those rights  thus flagrantly disregarding the United Stations resolutions which were adopted in line with the provisions of the Charter and with the right of peoples to self-determination.The State of Qatar lends its full support to every well-meaning effort aimed at helping the Palestinian people attain their inalienable right to settle their problems and to have their own State  in conformity with the principle of self- determination set forth in the Charter and with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.In Lebanon  the tragedy continues and the Lebanese people still suffer the horrors of a war that seems without end. We welcome the political developments that took place last year as well as the recent constitutional changes approved by the Lebanese Parliament  which would ensure equality among the people. We commend the efforts made by all parties concerned to reach a just and speedy settlement to this tragedy and to begin building a prosperous future for this sister country.The Taif meeting provided a good opportunity for our Lebanese brethren to meet as representatives in their own parliament. This created an atmosphere that inspired concord and confidence for restoring Lebanon's national unity. That  however  cannot be achieved unless Israel withdraws from the occupied parts of Lebanon and  indeed  from all occupied Arab territories.Israeli occupation is a stumbling block in the way of peace and security for the whole region. We appeal to the United Nations  and especially to those Member States  who under the Charter have assumed special responsibilities for maintaining international peace and security  to make the efforts necessary to establish justice and to right the wrong by ensuring the full and speedy implementation of all resolutions adopted by the Security Council calling for the termination of the Israeli occupation of those territories. Notwithstanding the international détente  there are still several hotbeds of tension that cause trouble in international relations and continue to threaten regional security in a number of the world's regions of the world.As we turn to the question of Cyprus  we commend the silent efforts made by the Secretary-General jointly with the parties concerned to solve the differences and reach a settlement that would ensure for both Cypriot communities a safe and stable life together.We cannot fail to express our pleasure at the positive developments that took place in Central America as a result of the efforts on the part of leaders faithful to their countries and to their causes  seeking a just and peaceful settlement for the problems of the region in a way that would ensure for its peoples stability  prosperity and a secure livelihood.As for South Africa  the State of Qatar has consistently condemned the policy of apartheid. Now  it welcomes the changes that have taken place in that country with a view to eliminating the consequences of that policy. Yet  we regret the clashes that are being used as an excuse for the return to certain oppressive measures. We sincerely hope that all efforts will continue with a view to ending the policy of apartheid and eliminating all its consequences so that the African people there will be able to exercise unconditionally their legitimate rights.The drug problem is getting worse every year because of increased demand and increased production of drugs in many parts of the world. Drugs have become one of the most serious threats to the political  economic  social and cultural structure of every society both in industrialised and developing countries. It is essential therefore to strengthen international co-operation in fighting this social plague. Industrialised countries must contribute to those efforts. In fact  because of their wealth and advanced technologies their responsibilities in this area should be greater. My country recognises the importance of protecting the environment and preserving clean air  soil and food and  consequently  ensuring human safety. We also realize that if we fail to take such measures  the environment will deteriorate to the point that it will be unable to sustain life  not only in one region but throughout the world. The atmospheric changes and the pollution of water  oceans and seas go beyond political boundaries and may lead to disastrous consequences. We hope those problems will be the subject of in-depth study by the United Nations Conference on Development and Environment that will be held in Brazil in 1992. My country attaches special importance to this question  since such studies would be most helpful to the efforts my country is making to protect its environment and to improve its environmental studies and efforts.In the field of economic development  my country welcomes the outcome of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly on the revitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries in the aftermath of political developments and the improvement of relations between the super-Powers. My country recognizes that those developments deeply affected international economic co-operation and enhanced the efforts made by the industrialized countries in giving assistance to developing countries  to help them develop their economies and to join in the march of economic and social progress. In support of international efforts in that connection and in solidarity with fraternal Arab States and other developing nations my Government has decided to forgive all debts and the interest thereon owed by such nations  in the hope that that decision will contribute to mitigating the heavy burdens that shackle those nations and  thereby  further the progress of their development efforts.The world stands today at the threshold of unprecedented changes. It must seize the historic opportunity now within reach  in order to deal with problems it has been struggling with for several decades. The world is no longer so preoccupied with ideological and political problems that it must ignore such more important issues as the eradication poverty  disease and illiteracy  the root causes of backwardness. There are no more obstacles to prevent the industrialized countries from making concerted efforts to provide assistance for economic and social development.The thinking of the super-Powers is now directed towards finding ways and means of using the funds that will be released as a result of disarmament in the wake of the ending of East-West confrontation. Today there is hope that detente will result in the channelling of such surpluses  which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars  to economic and social needs. There is today a duty to formulate an international development strategy that should take into account the needs of the developing world and  in particular  the vital interests of developing countries  which must be helped if the new world order is to be viable and sustainable.One of the questions that must be addressed seriously in the light of the new developments  is the existing imbalance in international economic relations. The imbalance between poor and rich is increasing at a time when it is in the interest of the entire world that prosperity be extended to all the peoples of the earth thereby ensuring the necessary balance in living standards and living patterns for all nations.I would share the pessimistic view the Secretary-General expressed in his report to the special session of the General Assembly when he characterised the 1980s as the lost decade of development. I also support his recommendation that we must seize the opportunity offered by international detente to agree on new concepts of international co-operation in the new decade.The developing countries are very eager to co-operate in finding effective solutions to the economic and social problems which beset our world and  to that end  we reiterate our belief in the feasibility of negotiations between developing and industrial countries to build international economic co-operation on sound and rational senses that would take everyone's interests into account Accordingly  my country considers that the role of the United Nations is essential in establishing those desired sound and rational bases  and we hope that that role would contribute effectively to the realisation of the necessary economic growth and be a prelude to the transfer of technology and scientific research in the interests of development in the developing world.By the same token  we hope that mutual understanding and concord will continue to prevail in the international political climate and that the present detente will be a first step towards further progress in the disarmament process and the reduction of nuclear weapons  leading eventually to their complete elimination  so that peace and understanding may prevail in the world.In that connection  we support the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. We are of the opinion that the international community's acquiescence in Israel's acquisition of nuclear weapons  encourages that country to pursue its nuclear armaments programme and  consequently  to persist in its political obduracy. It has so far refused to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty  which was the subject of a Review Conference held recently at Geneva.It is a fact of life that the world will never enjoy real political détente without economic security. We all know that the economic crisis continues and that the problems besetting most developing countries cannot be solved without help from the industrialised countries. The international community continues to be confronted by the debt problem^ which defies all solutions. We believe that no solution can be found until the industrialised nations reduce their restrictions on trade and modify their monetary policies. In that connection  we consider that the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris is a good beginning  one that  we hope  will open the door to other measures which may lead to solutions to the chronic problems of economic development in the developing countries.Those problems can be properly addressed only within the framework of the United Nations· It is  therefore  incumbent upon us to lend our full support to the Organisation and to place our full trust in it in order for it to be fully effective. Thus  it will benefit the whole of the international community and pave the way for justice  mutual respect and world stability."
"121",5908,"ROU",45,1990,"﻿It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly the United Nations for the first time. I have come bearing a message of friendship and solidarity from the people of Romania. Indeed  I feel at home here  in this family of nations  pursuing the same goals of peace and co-operation  aimed at bettering the lives of individuals and communities. In this endeavour  we are fully convinced  Mr. President  that under your guidance the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly will be able to meet the historic challenges with which we are faced in these times of change. I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly and to wish you every success.Romania is fully committed to the ideals of the United Nations. More than ever  we now understand how dangerous isolation is  how contrary to our people's interests were the former tendencies to surround us with a barbed wire fence of false ideas and assumptions. Those old policies in Romania were skilfully designed to push us backwards  and to cut short our aspirations to human dignity and freedom. Nothing is more important than freedom. There is no reality that has more obviously been at the basis of mankind's efforts through the ages than freedom. We know this all too well in Romania and we cherish the idea that freedom is the only ground in which all the other aspects of a truly dignified human life can take root. Freedom gives sense to democracy that more than fulfils the aspirations of the majority. It gives rights to minorities and to those who dissent as well. This is how we now think and feel in my country and what we work for. At the same time  we know how far we are from truly implementing these values in our political and social life. The heavy heritage of the former dictatorial regime still hinders our efforts. Disunity and mistrust  lack of a civil society and education  the total destruction of this social framework  the erosion of the status of public servants  the loss of dignity of the working man by deprivation and alienation of profits  the humiliation of the whole nation by dictating its needs and wants - all that has left us empty and uncertain.The dispersal of national energies has led to dissimilarities and violence  deplorable to the extreme. As always  the Government bears the responsibility. It is a matter of both perception and reality: the reality of less cohesion and the unsubstantial perception of a guilt that does not exist as such. In spite of all that  any act of domestic violence distresses us. Clashes of different social groups on the streets  politically exploited by interested forces  are terrible events designed to Ьо1Л us back.Our only hope is in the fortitude of the Romanian people and its commitment to freedom and democracy. Starting everything anew  we know how difficult it will be to cope with all these situations  but we are determined to win. On such a road it is easy to make mistakes  and we certainly have. But our good will and determination to overcome the present state of affairs must also be taken into account. We are the first to acknowledge errors and to be grateful for having these pointed out. Nothing is more difficult than battling with one's own limitations and deficiencies. We must destroy our own ""idola mentis"". Every now and again revolutions begin like that. Before finding the true God  Abraham destroyed the idols of his father and his family. To believe in the truth  one should start by not believing in the false. There is no alternative. It is a radical and painful change when this is experienced in practical terms  in terms of a whole nation  and in terms of every individual.What happens now in Romania is unique in history. It is a matter not only of changing a few institutions and dignitaries  but of restructuring mentalities and changing the whole fabric of a society. We strive to free the initiative of the individual  to open up new vistas for the imagination and energies of our nation  in order to enable us to contemplate the future with confidence and real hope.As a Latin country  Romania professes an unabated belief in the law and in legal institutions. Our Latin roots have held us fast to this belief that the nightmare of totalitarianism was not able to destroy. In domestic and international affairs  we favour the rule of law  and for that reason we profess a strict respect for the Charter of the United Nations. Our policy is aligned with that of the United Nations. For that reason  we rejoice at the end of a division from which Europe suffered for so long. Nations are now indeed able to unite and manage crises that otherwise might hamper their efforts to reach a common goal. This was demonstrated in August  when we quickly responded in the Security Council to the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. Romania played a role in the adoption of the resolutions that are now so well known  and we viewed our position as one that reflected the common will of the Organization.Romania took that as its policy to view major problems as concerning all of us  with decisions to be taken on a common ground. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  my country feels that it must represent not only its own interests but those of the large majority of the United Nations as well. We will work for the Organisation. We will faithfully respect the status of the international public servant. We will strengthen our ties with all Member States on the basis of just and stable international relations. We do not support either past or present decisions that affect the way of life of entire peoples  and we will favour reconsidering resolutions that have such connotations.We are happy to note that major conflicts in the world are about to come to an end. They were either conflicts left over from the Second World War  as was the case with Berlin  or ideological ones ignited by parties and factions in a contest for power. The universality and prestige of the Organization will help in resolving all controversies peacefully. Mo one can disregard the moral pressure of nations united. We were happy to welcome among us Namibia and Liechtenstein  both countries friendly to Romania. We warmly congratulate the people of Yemen on achieving the unity of its country  and we heartily support the memorandum of the 12 European nations on the reduction of the confrontation between the two Koreas  another vestige of the cold war. We are pleased by the political dialogue of the two Korean parties at the prime-minister level  and we express the hope that the Korean people will be fully represented in the United Nations vary soon.At this very moment one of the most important events in contemporary history is taking place. The unity of the two German States is completed. No should all be aware of the majesty of this day. It marks indeed the end of the Second World War and of its aftermath. The grin consequences of the divergent trends is the world plagued our efforts long after the actual cessation of the shooting war in 1945. The war of ideologies was a prolongation of the confrontation on the battlefields. This rostrum was very often the focal point of bitter rivalries  and we are therefore proud to have been present here in this Hall of nations when the President of the United States proclaimed!""Now is the time to set aside old debates  old procedures  old controversies and old resolutions. It is time to replace polemic attacks with pragmatic action.” That is indeed the spirit of our time. We should imbue our actions with that spirit  and not in international politics alone. It would be advisable to apply that attitude to cases of domestic conflicts as well. Everything I am attempting to express leads us necessarily to a concept that we believe should play a major role in international affairs. We night call it ""human solidarity."" This  again  is something that history has taught us in Romania wall. We have had enough experience of an abstract relationship between the individual and the State  of vague ties between entities called nation-States. The obsolete framework of the cold-war era blinded us to what we now perceive to be the basic principle of the United Nations.How could we all work here without feeling solidarity in confronting the major issues of international peace and security  the environment  the phenomenon of terrorism  drugs and the poverty still rampaging through whole areas of the world? How could we confront those major challenges otherwise than In full solidarity? The most important recent event was the Summit for Children  a wonderful gathering of Heads of State or government that stressed the will to care for our future. It is significant and reassuring to see that we are able to focus our efforts more on preserving Ingenuity and candour and less on fights and political disputes.In our view this truly new world should b· based on the rule of law. Nothing better reflects what is common to us all than a lawful world. We in Romania believe that international law is meant to bring us together  not to impose on us or to impinge on the sovereign attributes of States. We favour greater recourse to the International Court of Justice in a matter of a legal nature and to its advice in all kinds of disputes.We should like to pay tribute to the good offices of the Secretary-General  to his moral stature and his reputation for impartiality. We would like to see bin play a greater role in exercising authority and mediation in the conflicts that are still tearing apart the wonderful unity towards which we are working.There is no better way of solving the problems confronting us in the world today than by revealing the sources of tensions and conflicts. It seems that nothing can more thoroughly destabilise the world and disrupt the order so painfully achieved than poverty and an unequal sharing of the riches God has bestowed upon us. We shall have to build up a new structure for the economic system that will enable our Organisation to adopt a more coherent course in helping poor countries to develop their respective economies and to improve international trade. The spectacular developments in Eastern Europe and Romania's firm determination to achieve a market-oriented economy need the support of the industrialised countries. Our intention is to undergo a smooth transition without major convulsions and upheavals. We need help and the concurrence of multilateral factors  and we are ready to assume full responsibility in this respect. The issues at stake are of major importance  taking into account the centrality of the economic factor for all societies. Zn this regard the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  on the basis of its rich experience gained during 10 years of its existence as a United Nations instrument  can play an important role in supporting the efforts of developing countries.My country pledges to respectfully the internationally recognised norms and standards of human rights. In this fundamental matter the Universal Declaration of Human Sights is our guide. These rights belong to us all. They are our rights. We are now implementing  without reservations  the provisions of the Final Document of the General European Conference held at Vienna. Furthermore  Romania contributed to a substantial document at the Conference at Copenhagen on the human dimensions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The process of ratification of a number of international legal instruments regarding human rights has been started. Foreign observers were invited to watch  in May of this year  the first free elections held in Romania after the Second World War. In fact  we should have preferred to have the United Nations watch our electoral process. There are countries that might need support in this regard. We should be glad to see the United Nations playing a more formal role in efforts to establish the foundations of democratic Governments through free elections  Authoritative experts from around the world might assist a Special Co-ordinator for Electoral Assistance  as was suggested here.The totalitarian regimes increased the heavy burden of ethnic strife and conflicts in eastern Europe. My country is no exception to this situation. We are in the process of change in the area of the rights of ethnic minorities also. We want a pluralistic society with full respect for all human beings. We consider everybody equal  individuals and communities. In Romania  we have already createdthe framework for political manifestation and representation by all so-calledminorities. By law  all national Minorities have proportional representation and a rostrum from which to make their voices heard. Of course there are intricacies of inter-ethnic relations  well nourished over the centuries by separate interests  and their consideration will require great wisdom and patience. We will work hard. We will dedicate all our energies to having a good and united country for all our citizens. We truly confess that we do not know the sip code of paradise  but we feel justified in hoping that our people will again provide an example of inter-ethnic peace. There is no other way. These are the basics of life nowadays in any respectable country in the world  and we will not give up one inch of our Determination to respect the freedom and well-being of all our citizens.Romania welcomes the changes in Europe as a first step towards harmonising the well-known dimensions of security: political  military  economic and humanitarian. These changes have brought us to the threshold of a new chapter in the CSCB process that will lead us to a more reliable security system  broader co-operation and better understanding among nations. The summit meeting to be held in Paris nest month is meant to take far-reaching decisions. The CSCK ministerial meeting concluded yesterday at New York highlighted the determination of the participating States to ensure the full success of that historic meeting and made an important contribution.The positive course of events on the continent could be stimulated by subregional approaches. We hope that the Balkan States  with their traditions of co-operation and having common interests  could play an active part in accelerating the process of establishing a pattern for European security and co-operation. With this aim in mind  Romania has recently suggested the founding of a Forum for Security and Co-operation in the Balkans that could improve relations among countries in that region as an integral part of the CSQS process.Along the same lines  we propose a project for co-operation among the countries bordering the Danube. Our intention is to make better use of that great European waterway a project that might include protection of the environment of the Danube  development of trade and economic co-operation  management of the water flow of the Danube  co-operation in the field <ь transportation and development of tourism.Other important initiatives relate to developing multilateral co-operation in the Mediterranean and Black Sea areas. The broad support given the initiative to organise a conference on security and co-operation in the Mediterranean at the current CSCE meeting at Palma de Mallorca is based on the general idea that ensuring peace and stability in that area in of critical importance for the attainment of the goal we are pursuing on the European continent. In our small  interdependent world that is true of the Mediterranean also applies to other areas of the earth.We believe that the processes enhancing closer relations and co-operation among States  as well as the strengthening of the concept of common interests. In the new world design  favour the development of regional and subregional co-operation. In fact  the Charter itself places great emphasis on regional bodies  which  in our opinion  should be encouraged.It seems to me that Romania is still a country that arouses a lot of controversy. The same is true of its President and the current administration. This is only natural in times of change  when one emerges from a nightmare and  still has its images in the eyes. I want to make it clear here that the glory we really want is that of bringing about peace  stability and freedom in my country. Again and again  we will state our firm belief that freedom of the individual is the starting point of everything. The standards have been set up in the Universal Declaration of Hunan Sights.  That is our message; that is the commitment the Romanian people mandated me to convey to the Assembly. As the great Romanian poet Mihail Eminescu wrote a century ago ""Thorough the length of time  different and still the same.Their yearnings and their hopes ere of one kind composed"".In conclusion  I should like to stress again that we shall be on the side of ell those working for the fulfilment of the great ideals of the United Nations.

"122",5954,"RUS",45,1990,"﻿First of all  Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high post which you occupy. This is not only a tribute to your very great personal qualities but also an acknowledgement of the role of Malta in international affairs. I must also express our special gratitude to the unflagging efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Peres de Cuellar. His inexhaustible faith in the capabilities of the Organisation  his perseverance and his capacity for innovation have done much to enhance the authority of the Organisation. The Soviet delegation agrees with the basic ideas contained in the report o£ the Secretary-General on the work of the Organisation for the past year.Lastly  we wish sincerely to welcome the delegation of the Principality of Liechtenstein and congratulate it on the admission of that country to the United Nations. We shall co-operate with it in all spheres.From the exceptional vantage point of this forty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly one might look back in amazement at how strikingly the terrain we have covered in just one year differs from the familiar landscape of the preceding four decades and more. Politically  this has been not just a calendar year but a light-year in the history of the world. The ""cold war""  with its accompanying stress psychoses and anticipation of disaster is no longer a part of our life. Gone is the strain of daily confrontation  propaganda squabbles and reciprocal threats.This has been a year during which pieces of the Berlin wall were popular souvenirs. And now there is no longer a physical division of Europe  and a final line has been drawn under the Second World War. The unification of the two German States is being completed. The ""German question"" that ""great"" and ""classical"" problem of world politics which only yesterday seemed intractable  has been resolved calmly and to mutual satisfaction. On behalf of the Soviet people  of all Soviet citizens  I wish to offer our sincere and heartfelt congratulations to the German people  the German nation  on this tremendous event in the history of that State and of that people and in the history of Europe.Almost imperceptibly  the military blocs have lost their enemies. They are beginning to build their relations on a new basis  moving away from confrontation  which is being eroded by disarmament  by reductions in defence spending  by the expansion of confidence-building measures and by the emergence of collective and co-operative security structures.Unprecedented progress has been made in the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts by political means. In southern Africa  the United Nations plan for the granting of independence to Namibia has been implemented. The situation concerning Nicaragua has been settled  and a dynamic search for peace is under way in Cambodia  Afghanistan and other hot spots of the globe. We should not forget Angola  Ethiopia  Cyprus  the Korean peninsula and Western Sahara. All this is being done with the most active participation of the United Nations.These positive changes in the world  we can say without exaggeration  have been propelled by the new nature of the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States  which are evolving from co-operation to interaction and partnership. The meetings of the Presidents of the super-Powers in Malta  Camp David and Helsinki have been major events in world politics.The political environment is being clearly defined by the world-wide recognition of the supremacy of universal human values. Democratic forms are becoming consolidated in running the affairs of States and in the conduct of international affairs.The United Nations  too  is being reborn. We are pleased to note that the ideas of President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union concerning the role of the Organisation in a changing world have been found to be in harmony with majority opinion and with the demands of real life.The central concepts of today's politics are co-operation  interaction and partnership in solving extremely severe global problems such as economic backwardness  poverty  social inequality and environmental protection.Had this session taken place before August 1980  we should have had every reason to say that mankind had emerged from a narrow and dangerous passage and had wide and glowing horizons ahead of it.But now our field of vision has been obscured by the dark cloud of the aggression against Kuwait. On that ""Black Thursday""  Iraq flagrantly violated the Charter of the United Nations  the principles of international Law  the universally recognized norms of morality and the standards of civilized behaviour. Iraq has committed an unprovoked act of aggression  has annexed a neighbouring sovereign State  has seized thousands of hostages and is resorting to unprecedented blackmail  threatening to use weapons of mass destruction.There is also another dimension to Iraq's action. It is a blow directed essentially against all that mankind has recently achieved  all that we have been able to accomplish together by adopting the new political thinking in determining our future.An act which one can unquestionably describe without exaggeration as an act of terrorism has been perpetrated against the emerging new world order. This is a major affront to mankind. Unless we find a way to respond to it and deal with the situation  civilization will be set back half a century.Iraq's actions are having and will have the gravest consequences for the Iraqi people itself and for millions of men  women and children in many countries of the world  for their hopes and their future  a large-scale war may break out in the Persian Gulf region any day  at any hour. From this rostrum  we should like to appeal once again to the leaders of Iraq. We are making this appeal as their old friends and as a country that has found the courage to condemn its own wrongdoings against certain States in the past. We call upon them to change their thinking and to obey the demands not only of law but also of common sense  to take a responsible and humane attitude  above all towards the Iraqi people  who  we are convinced  yearn for peace  tranquillity and good relations with their neighbours. We also trust that at this time of grave trial the Arab peoples and States will live up to the hopes of Mankind and help to find a way out of the Persian Gulf crisis. This would make it possible to deal with other hotbeds of conflict in the Middle East and at last to find an equitable solution to the Palestine problem.If the world has survived to this day  it is because at tragic Moments in its history the forces of evil were always opposed by the forces of good  arbitrary power by the rule of law  treachery and baseness by honour and decency  and violence by strength of spirit and faith in justice.Today is no time for rejoicing  but one cannot help feeling a certain satisfaction at the unprecedented unity of the Security Council and at international public opinion's unequivocal assessment of Iraq's behaviour. This gives us confidence in the ability of the United Nations to deal with this grave international crisis. As is clear from the positions taken by Members of the Organisation  the Security Council has a mandate to go as far as the interests of world peace require. I have no doubt that today's meeting  on which agreement has already been reached  will again demonstrate the unity and determination of our collective organ  the Security Council  in such situations.Some may think that Iraq is being judged by a different standard  one higher than that applied to other countries even in the quite recent past. My answer is this: it is good that we have reached this point. It is a good thing that we have adopted a universal human yardstick of good and evil  that we have started calling aggression by its proper name and consider it necessary to condemn and punish its perpetrator and to help the victims of injustice.These days are a trying time  a test for the Organisation. If it passes this test it will immeasurably enhance its prestige  gain new experience end new capabilities. There is no doubt that it will make use of them to promote the restoration o£ peace and justice in other conflict situations and to ensure the implementation of its resolutions bearing on all the regional problems to which reference was made by previous speakers.As approach based on mankind's common interest does not permit any other course of action. From now on the world community intends to act by a single set of standards.International relations are being freed from the vestiges of the ""cold war"" which for many years had a negative effect on the world's legal order. We are again becoming United Nations and are returning to our own global constitution - the Charter of the United Nations - to those of its provisions which were forgotten for a while but which experience has proved to be indispensable for the most important and most necessary of our tasks  the maintenance of international peace and security. The establishment of the principles of new thinking in world politics has enabled us to start implementing the effective measures of persuasion and enforcement provided for in the Charter.In the contest of recent events  I should like to remind those who regard aggression as an acceptable form of behaviour that the United Nations has the authority to take measures for ""the suppression of acts of aggression"". There is already ample evidence that that right can be exercised. Of course  before that - and I reiterate ""before that"" - all political  peaceful  non-military forms of pressure must be exerted on the aggressor  obviously in combination with economic and other enforcement measures.In a way  the Persian Gulf crisis is not only a tragedy and a dangerous threat to peace but also a serious challenge to all of us to review the ways and means of maintaining security on our planet  the methods of protecting law and order  the machinery for controlling the processes which affect the state of human civilisation  in the broadest sense of the term  and the role of the United Nations. It cannot be otherwise in today's world. Only in this way can we make the period of peace lasting and irreversible and follow up on our initial success in bringing about u healthier climate in international relations.Life poses new tasks. What will be needed first and foremost is  in our view  an effort to gain a theoretical and conceptual understanding of the political  military  technological  economic  ecological  humanitarian and cultural realities of the modern world and of its human dimension. The world is becoming consolidated around universal human values. Partnership is replacing rivalry. On this basis  relationships are being built among many countries that once looked upon each other as adversaries and rivals.Partnership is not merely a fashionable term. It became evident during the latest crisis and underlay the close and constructive interaction among the permanent members of the Security Council. But the decline of East-Nest rivalry as a real or perceived factor in international relations may bring new figures and new phenomena to the arena of world politics. One such phenomenon we shall probably have to deal with is that of claims to regional hegemony.Among the issues assuming a critical importance for the future of mankind are the non-proliferation of nuclear  chemical  bacteriological and missile technologies and  more generally  the disproportionate growth of the military sector in the economies and lives of some countries or States. Even in the past the doctrines of the ""balance of terror"" and ""nuclear deterrence"" were questionable means of maintaining the security of the world. In the new conditions of today they have simply become irrelevant.We need to define the criteria of defence sufficiency. After the Iraqi aggression it would seem difficult to talk about this. After all  what can be sufficient in the face of the irrational? On the other hand  this aggression has once again underscored the validity of the argument that no country should have the exclusive prerogative or absolute freedom to determine its own level of armament. Any other approach would result in an unbridled arms race and all-out militarisation; we must look towards different principles  towards accommodation to the concerns of others and towards a balance of armaments at the lowest possible levels.We in the Soviet Union have the unfortunate experience of having built up an excessive military capability  and we know very well what that costs. This was due more to an erroneous assessment of the situation and a desire to protect the country against any eventuality than to any evil intent or aggressiveness. At the time  we and our rivals took an unduly ""arithmetical"" approach to the concept of military parity. Of course  parity is needed for global stability  but it should not go beyond the limits of reasonable defence needs.We have drawn and continue to draw appropriate conclusions for ourselves. It is now common knowledge that militarisation is wasteful for any country and can be ruinous when taken to extremes.In the longer term  the world community will need to monitor the military power of States  arms supplies and transfers of military technology. Such an approach will be in everyone0s interests and will strengthen stability and trust. Otherwise we shall constantly be confronted with armed conflicts and attempts at intimidation and blackmail. Above all  it will be necessary to keep a close watch on those countries that are making determined efforts to build up the offensive capabilities of their armed forces; we must not only observe what they are doing but also call upon them to explain why it is being done and why it is necessary.Of course the United Nations itself will have to play the primary role in this. But the Organisation will need effective support from regional security structures  which are already becoming a reality in Europe and which we hope will emerge in Asia and the Pacific  in the Middle East  in Central America and elsewhere in the world.We might consider the idea of introducing at the global and regional levels the international registration of certain types of armaments that are produced or acquired. There is unquestionably a need for transparency in this area.We need to agree on principles governing the sale and supply of arms. Such attempts were made in the past  but unfortunately they were not carried through to their logical conclusion.In our view  the Geneva Conference on Disarmament must be urgently requested to address this issue and to submit recommendations to the General Assembly at its next session.Two years ago the Soviet delegation raised the issue of reactivating the work of the Security Council's Military Staff Committee  Recent developments convince us of the need to return to the original idea conceived by the creators of this Organisation and of its Charter.We know why the Military Staff Committee has never become a functioning body. During the ""cold war"" the Committee did not and could not have a role to play. How  however  we see that without substantive recommendations from that body the Security Council is unable to carry out its functions under the Charter. The architects of our Organisation proceeded from the harsh realities of the Second World War and were right in assuming that if the Organisation was to be effective in keeping the peace and preventing war  it must have the means to enforce its decisions and  if necessary  to suppress aggression and must also have machinery for the preparation and co-ordination of such actions.The Soviet delegation believes that the Security Council must take the necessary organisational steps to be able to act in strict conformity with the provisions of the Charter.It should begin by initiating steps to reactivate the work of the Military Staff Committee and to study the practical aspects of assigning national military contingents to serve under the authority of the Council.The Soviet Union is prepared to conclude an appropriate agreement with the Security Council. We are sure that the other permanent members of the Council and States that might be approached by it will do the same.If the Military Staff Committee had worked properly  if appropriate agreements had been concluded between the Council and its permanent members and if other organizational aspects of countering threats to peace had been worked out  there would now be no need for individual States to act unilaterally. After all  however justified they might be  such actions provoke a mixed response  create problems for those States themselves and may not be acceptable to all.By contrast  there is no reason to object to actions taken by the legitimate international ""law-enforcement bodies"" - the Security Council and the Military Staff Committee.We also should not underestimate even the psychological effect of the Security Council's acquiring structures and forces to counter aggression.I should like to emphasize that the use of force is possible only as a last resort. We must rely on non-military  political means and pursue our objectives in a peaceful manner. Today  ore than ever before  it is these methods that are becoming effective.The latest crisis has dramatically illustrated the importance of preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.To be frank  the situation is becoming most alarming. Let us face its cracks have appeared in the nuclear non-proliferation regime; difficulties are being encountered in expanding the zone of application of the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It is time to trigger the emergency systems and face the question in all seriousness in order to save the situation. As a matter of the utmost urgency  nuclear tests have to be stopped. If testing is stopped  we have a chance to survive "" otherwise the world will perish. I have no doubt whatever about this. We need to tell people about this frankly  without taking refuge in all sorts of specious arguments. Perhaps we should invite the parliaments of all countries to express their attitude regarding nuclear explosions and nuclear tests. We could organize a world-wide parliamentary referendum.What else has to happen in order to set in motion at long list the elimination of chemical weapons? The process must be completed by the conclusion of a convention. The Soviet Union and the United States are setting an example by doing this on a bilateral basis. But what about the others? It is really odd that while there is no person  no politician who would publicly call for retaining toxic agents  things are essentially at a standstill and we still have no convention.Perhaps we should ask for a roll-call vote here in this General Assembly Hall and see who votes against the proposal? If everyone is in favour  it will be a simple matter to set up a binding schedule for completing work on the Convention and to establish a time-frame for the destruction of chemical weapons. Similar problems  mostly concerning verification  arise with regard to biological weapons. Swift and decisive action is needed on all these issues. Yet the debate at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament let us honestly admit  proceeds in a calm and leisurely manner. Can we accept this? Even as dangerous developments are gaining critical momentum in the world  the Geneva negotiations are continuing at a pace that was set at the time of the ""cold war"".I think the negotiators at the Palais des Nations at Geneva should roll up the blinds. Let them see what is going on outside and let people know what our disarmament pundits are meditating upon.I do not want to offend anyone. I know that those working there are honourable people. But what is to be done? The time has come to cry out to act decisively and firmly.I cannot fail to mention yet another aspect of security.The world community should also consider the possibility of various ""unconventional situations"" arising from the mass taking of hostages and cases of blackmail with threats of the use of particularly dangerous and destructive weapons.These problems will have to be addressed at two levels: technical and legal. We could start by setting up a group of experts for special contingencies under the auspices of the Security Council.The group could include outstanding anti-terrorism experts  psychologists  nuclear scientists  chemists  physicians  disaster-relief organizers  experts on the physical protection of facilities  and the like.Recommendations concerning the management of ""unconventional situations"" should be made known to a limited number of people. The Security Council may find it necessary  upon recommendation of the Military Staff Committee  to establish a rapid-response force to be formed on a contract basis from units specially designated by different countries  including the five permanent members of the Security Council. This idea also deserves consideration and discussion. But technical methods alone are not enough to deal with such things. In our view  it is extremely important to institute a new norm in international law which would declare that any person who threatens to use weapons of mass destruction for purposes of blackmail  to take hostages or to engage in mass terror is guilty of a crime against humanity. Work on this has been under way for a long time somewhere in the labyrinths of this Organisation  but its end is not yet in sight.What we need  however  is to create  as soon as possible  a moral and legal environment in which anyone guilty of grave crimes against humanity  of participating in acts of mass repression  hostage-taking  terrorist acts or torture  and those guilty of particular cruelty in the use of force  could not escape punishment and would not be absolved from personal responsibility even if he acted under orders.The principle of suppressing aggression and threats to peace should  in our view  be complemented by the principle of individual responsibility and by commensurate punishment.The Persian Gulf crisis is causing major dislocations in the entire system of the world economy  as other speakers have pointed out. Their full magnitude is difficult even to assess at present. It is clear that the consequences will be severe for the economies of the developing countries  particularly the poorest ones. Merely stating this is not enough; action must be taken without delay It is necessary to establish  as soon as possible  an international mechanism  even if only a temporary one  for example  under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank  to mitigate the adverse consequences of this crisis for countries which are in a particularly vulnerable position. We are of the view that sounding out the economic repercussions of the crisis should be primarily the function of the United nations; the Organisation should be the centre of action in situations affecting the interests of many countries. History  particularly modern history  teaches all kinds of lessons. They must not be ignored or underestimated. One of them is that security can hardly be lasting unless it is supported by economic growth combined with spiritual health and by traditional cultural values combined with new technologies and with a concern for the environment. Co-operation in the 1990s must therefore be geared to the resolution of the entire set of global economic and environmental problems  λ new ""poverty curtain"" this time between North and South  must not be allowed to descend. If it does  the resulting division of the world may prove fatal to our civilisation. We have no time to lose  λ global strategy for development and for solving problems common to all mankind is needed now  and the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organisation rightly makes this point. The United Nations  supported by its specialized agencies and by outside intellectual resources  should set about formulating such a strategy.An interdependent world calls for a new level of multilateral economic partnership. Co-operation on a bilateral basis and in selected areas is no longer enough; it is global co-operation that is needed.The special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation clearly showed that everybody would gain if each group of countries were to adjust its approaches and show willingness to forsake individual or group self-interest in economic co-operation  setting as its highest priority the interests of the common good  a global self-interest  if you will  which would no longer be selfish. We welcome the provisions of the Declaration of the special session which support the integration of the Soviet Union and East European countries into the world economy. We hope that the United Nations will give concrete expression to its support for this process.The Soviet contribution to these efforts will certainly be growing as we move ahead with perestroika at home  deepen our economic reform and change over to a market economy. We have firmly opted for a closer association with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAST)  IMF  the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a view to joining them as soon as the necessary internal and external conditions are established. It is true that we are rather late  but none the less we have come to a firm position on this very important matter.We also see a unique contribution that we can make to the development of international co-operation. For geographical and other reasons  we are in a better position than others to serve as a link between Europe and Asia and to contribute to the establishment of a single Eurasian space in the economic  scientific  technological  environmental and other spheres. This will certainly be facilitated  for instance  by Soviet transport systems  main lines already in existence  and communications equipment  including space communications.Scientific and technological progress has become a major factor shaping the world's future. The global nature of its implications places in a new perspective the need to co-ordinate the policies of States in this area. The United Nations and its system of organisations can and must  in our view  assume a leading role in these efforts.This is an area in which trust among States is of special importance. Without trust  barriers to international scientific and technical co-operation cannot be dismantled. We think that the international community should take a stand against monopolists in the field of science and technology. Otherwise  it will be difficult to deal effectively with underdevelopment and the many problems of the developing world. If we succeeded in strongly focusing the global development strategy on scientific and technological progress  we could substantially mitigate such alarming trends as the brain drain  the growing migration of professionals  and the rising cost and borrowing scope of research. The United Nations would do well to take the lead in organising a global forum on the role of thought science and technology in addressing the problems of today's world. The Soviet Union is prepared to take the initiative in holding a major international forum of this kind in our country.Much has been said lately on environmental issues. We even run the risk of talking away our future  for up to now - I emphasise that this is at the global level - there has been much talk but little action  while the destruction of the environment is outstripping our preparations to deal with the environmental threat.I hope that even as we continue to prepare for the 1992 Conference on the Environment and Development in Brazil  we shall be able to start implementing specific environmental protection projects. In our view  one of the priority measures would be to establish a United Nations centre for emergency environmental assistance. We have submitted to the Secretary-General a list of Soviet scientists and specialists whom  at the request of the centre  we would be ready to send to areas of environmental disasters at our own expense to serve as members of international expert teams. We are well aware that a healthy environment requires considerable investment at both the national and the global level. As we see it  the way out of the problem is reduction of military expenditure and conversion of military production. There is no alternative. The figures are well known. Bight hundred billion dollars must be spent before the end of this century to avert environmental degradation and destruction - almost the same amount as is spent by the world for military purposes each year.The urgency of environmental-protection problems has been highlighted by the Chernobyl tragedy. We are grateful to the Governments and the various agencies which are joining in the hard work of dealing with the consequences of the disaster. On behalf of the Soviet people  I also wish to express our gratitude to all international  governmental and public organisations and private citizens who have offered their help to the victims.Our special thanks go to the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and to those countries and organisations that have shown such a touching interest in Chernobyl's children  inviting them to cone for rest and medical treatment and gladdening the hearts of the children with their concern and their warmth. The Secretary-General's decision to designate a Special Representative for Chernobyl disaster relief has also been greatly appreciated in our country.The multi-dimensional approach to security supported by our Organisation brings into focus the interrelationship between the security of States and the well-being and freedom of the individual. The human being is coming to the fore and the human dimension is becoming a universal yardstick for any international undertaking. For us and for the United Nations the security of the individual  of every citizen  and the protection of fundamental human rights are inseparable from national security and from international security as a whole.I think the time has also come to look at regional conflicts from the standpoint of human rights. Those rights include the right to life and personal safety  as well as the right to en-joy fundamental freedoms and to participate in the democratic processes of one's society and one's State.The main task for the international community is to create conditions in which people would be able to make a free choice. Disputes must be settled not in the trenches of war but through the ballot-box  both regionally and within the individual countries and States.Speaking about the future  we should also like to respond to those who have been following with understandable concern the developments in our country. True  our domestic situation is not at all simple and is still far from stable. We can readily understand that concern: ours is an enormous country  with enormous potential  and the stability of the Soviet Union has a great influence on the state of the world.But whatever the complexity of our situation  one cannot fail to see that it is evolving against the background of the emancipation of all the peoples and all the citizens of our country  their active involvement in the political arena and the reaffirmation of their national identities. They are opening themselves to the world  and the world is discovering them.That this process is accompanied by some difficulties and even some costs should not cause excessive alarm  because the Soviet people and the democratic forces that are assuming responsibility for the future of our Union are aware of the Soviet Union's place in the world and of its responsibility for the maintenance of global stability. This awareness is shared by all the peoples of our multinational country  and they will all act responsibly  realising that stability in the world will also mean peace in their own home.In working for the renewal of our society  we have seen how important it is to defend democratic principles at all levels domestically and internationally.I should like to say in particular that if attempts to embark on the path of democracy were to end in failure or  worse still  in collapse  it would have grave consequences for the world's future  not to mention the risk of chaos and new dictatorships. Preventing that should be in everyone's interest.As we meet for the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  we are speaking not so much of the Organisation's maturity as of the beginning of its rebirth  its restoration according to the blueprints of 1945. Wiping off the grime left by the ""cold war""  we see a work of collective wisdom. The United Nations was conceived as an instrument of action. Henceforth  we must all ensure that our words are bound to joint - and I emphasise ""joint"" - actions. Now is the time precisely for that. The philosophy of today is a philosophy of action.This is the sixth time that I have spoken from this rostrum and participated in the work of the General Assembly. It has certainly been a great school  a first-rate school. Where else can one become so closely involved with the entire gamut of human problems and encounter such a constellation of personalities  intellectuals  professionals and scholars  whose brilliant qualities are epitomised by the Secretary-General of our Organisation  Mr. Peres de Cuellar?I consider myself very fortunate to have met and worked here with outstanding political leaders and great personalities during the years when the United Nations returned to being what it was meant to be - a centre for harmonising the activities of nations.

"123",6001,"RWA",45,1990,"﻿It is a great honour for me and for the entire delegation of Rwanda to convey to you  Sir  our sincere and warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session.Your election bears witness to the esteem in which you are held by the international community because of your outstanding personal qualities and your qualities as an experienced diplomat and  through you  this is a signal honour to your country  the Republic of Malta  which has always shown firm determination to contribute to a constant strengthening of relations of co-operation with all peace- and justice-loving countries. The Rwandese delegation at this session of the General Assembly wishes to assure you that it will make its modest contribution to ensuring the success of your noble task.I also wish to express our deepest gratitude to your predecessor  who guided with confidence and wisdom the work of the forty-fourth session and the seventeenth and eighteenth special sessions of the General Assembly of our Organisation  Mr. Joseph Garba  since he is indeed a worthy representative of his country  Nigeria  and of all of Africa. I should also like to pay a most sincere tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who for nine years has shown skill  tireless will  foresight and a spirit of balance in carrying out the incredibly difficult and complex tasks entrusted to him. We wish him continuing success and we wish that every day he may further enhance the high esteem in which our Organisation is held among nations.Ten years have already passed since my first statement to this body  in 1980. I note with satisfaction that during that period certain political conflicts of deep concern to the international community have developed along most favourable lines. Let me express on behalf of the delegation of Rwanda and on my own behalf our great joy at seeing the delegation of an independent Namibia among us. It is thanks to the outstanding leadership of President Sam Nujoma that the Namibian people was able - after three decades of armed struggle - to accede to the independence and the liberation of its country. My country  Rwanda  was delighted to welcome the admission of Namibia to the great family of the United Nations on 23 April 1990.I wish to take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to the Government and the people of Namibia  who are now engaged in the most difficult but commendable task of national reconstruction. The Rwandese Republic has always encouraged and supported all initiatives aimed at the reunification of the German nation and heartily endorses the positive developments concerning that issue. In this regard  the Rwandese Government and people welcomed with great joy the news of the crumbling of the Berlin Hall  which took place that memorable night of 9-10 November 1989  marking the end of an unacceptable split the German people had been experiencing for more than 40 years.On 3 October 1990  the German people will solemnly and joyfully celebrate their reunification  which has been particularly helped along by the events which have wrought such changes in Eastern Europe. It was with great satisfaction that the Rwandese Government welcomed the reunification agreement signed 31 August 1990  a sovereign decision reflecting the firm will of the German people to pool their efforts to build a more prosperous nation  a nation still further strengthened in its desire to build a better world.I reaffirm Rwanda's steadfast support for German reunification  and I most sincerely hope that all other nations rent by division will  like the German people  firmly commit themselves to follow this happy course in order quickly to put an end to their tragic situations It is in that spirit that the Rwandese Republic greatly appreciates and supports efforts designed to promote the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.Rwanda equally encourages the pursuit of direct negotiations  conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General  on the question of Cyprus. I am convinced that the solution to this problem must be found within the framework of the application of universal principles enshrining respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States. These two positive events  namely  the independence of Namibia and the crumbling of the Berlin Wall  of which the entire international community is proud  are the result of detente between East and West. Indeed  the end of the ideological struggle between the two super-Powers has allowed for the birth of a new era of democracy and freedom throughout the world  and in particular in the countries of Eastern Europe. We hope that the peace dividends will be converted into tools for the socio-economic development of the most disadvantaged countries.It is my duty  in addition  to emphasise that Rwanda firmly supports the negotiations begun between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South African Government  designed fully to dismantle the horrendous apartheid system  which has always been deplored from this rostrum. Given the tangible progress and courageous concessions made on all sides  there are grounds for hope that South Africa will very soon see the advent of an era of multiracial democracy.A plethora of old and new conflicts are striking various regions of the globe  with most of them concentrated in Africa  Asia and Latin America. We commend and support all efforts - bilateral  multilateral or international - aimed at putting an end to these devastating and economically painful rifts.Despite the positive results around the globe and the tireless efforts of the United Nations through its Secretary-General  one notes  unfortunately  that the international community has not yet solved all its problems  and certain new conflicts are darkening the backdrop of the international political scene.Indeed  the international community is now faced with s new conflict  born in the Persian Gulf  between Iraq and Kuwait  which has turned into an international crisis.Thus  defying all conventions governing international relations  Iraq invaded Kuwait on the night of 1 August 1990 and later declared its annexation. Rwanda believes that this invasion represents a glaring violation of peaceful coexistence and respect for the sovereignty of all States. It is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations which  in paragraph 4 of Article 2  states: ""All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State  or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.""Rwanda therefore energetically condemns this invasion and supports all the resolutions adopted by the Security Council  in particular those demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait  declaring Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void and imposing economic sanctions against Iraq with a view to putting an end to its territorial ambitions. We believe that only dialogue can avoid the futile bloodbath that would arise as a result of armed confrontation between the forces now in the Persian Gulf.Moreover  Rwanda believes that the crisis in the Persian Gulf should not make us forget the Palestinian problem  which has been with us for more than 40 years.In this tragedy in the Gulf  caused by behaviour attributable to another age  one cannot but note the extent to which the moral authority of the Organization has been strengthened thanks to the spirit of solidarity  a harbinger of hope for the future.The fragile situation in Liberia remains most alarming  since it is characterized by an inter-ethnic fratricidal war and by the total deterioration of the political and administrative structure. We therefore approve the measures taken by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOHAS) to put an end to this tragic situation. Like the efforts made by the international community to settle the crisis in the Persian Gulf  we believe that it should mobilize all necessary resources in order rapidly to resolve this tragic crisis in Liberia. At a time when we note the improvement in international relations and the prevailing climate of detente  we are unfortunately obliged to recall that the international economic situation does not at all lend itself to optimism  given the structural crisis which continues to exacerbate the already very deep gap between the industrialized and developing countries. The international community must do its utmost to transform into a more equitable and balanced order the current unjust international economic order  is characterised by structural imbalances. It must prevent the tragedies happening in poverty  which today  near the end of our century  is still the world's problem  and make still more vigorous and determined efforts to halt the conflicts and tensions existing among peoples and States. The Government of Rwanda continues to support efforts aimed at reactivating the North-South dialogue and strengthening South-South co-operation.Africa remains that continent where problems of underdevelopment are raised in terms of great human anguish and where the economic prospects of most countries which are in the category of least developed countries are gloomy indeed  particularly for those  such Rwanda  which are facing various structural handicaps that are exacerbated by numerous current economic conditions. Indeed  those countries  the most disadvantaged on our planet  are helplessly watching an accelerated deterioration of the living conditions of their people  who are increasingly becoming prey to the scourges of poverty  famine  malnutrition and ignorance.Rwanda  which has suffered along with its African peers  once again appeals to the international community for greater solidarity and more effective mutual understanding  given the problems battering the African continent. Airing these familiar problems  s should note those which most severely affect the economies of ◦nr countries  namely  the crucial problem of foreign debt  the collapse of raw-materials prices  the deterioration of terms of trade and the decline in public assistance for development.Indebtedness is a problem causing grave concern to the so-called developing countries in general and to the African countries in particular. Foreign debt is in fact  a heavy burden  a bottle-neck in the development process  since it has the negative effect of reinforcing the combination of factors which diminish the capacity for repayment while the imbalances in international trade grow worse  We urgently request that the search for solutions to the economic crisis of the third world in general  and of Africa in particular  should mobilize all the intellectual and moral resources required and take into account all aspects of the problem  without forgetting or overlooking the social aspects  for it is peoples  more than States  that must remain the major beneficiaries of the remedial measures to be advocated.An effective programme of economic recovery and growth must be concerned with rewarding the management and economic-recovery efforts made by countries  instead of merely being limited to prescribing immediate miracle-working recipes. The experience of several sub-Saharan countries in this sphere shows us that it is important to establish programmes that are suited to the realities and specific conditions of each country and  above all  are drawn up with the assistance of the recipient countries and populations. While it is true that the recovery of the world economy requires joint international action  it is even more true that the drastic measures sometime conceived in abstractio and imposed on the developing countries entail an extremely high economic  social and political cost those programmes  which often give solvency priority over all else  have created extremely difficult end often socially unacceptable situations  and have always led to an irresistible process of further indebtedness whose price future generations will have to pay.But we must also recognise that the revitalisation of our economies  a revival of exports  the growth and consolidation of the private sector  the reduction of public expenditure and the infusions of currency necessary for importing cannot take place in the present critical situation of the economies of the third world without assistance from fresh currency sources. For that reason  given the real economic difficulties which have become crushing  especially during the last two years  Rwanda began discussions in 1989 with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on the key ideas for a programme of economic recovery and growth  a programme adapted to the realities and the needs of my country will soon be signed.Allow me to say a few words about the difficult question of the environment. Rwanda believes that the entire international community is involved in this matter and -that a surge of international solidarity is required to mobilise all resources needed to preserve a healthful and viable environment for the human race.Everyone recognizes that ecological problems have now become matters of global concern  but there are still differences of opinion concerning the causes and responsibilities involved in the deterioration and the protection of the environment and concerning the measures to be taken in that area.In the countries of the third world underdevelopment  poverty  misery and ignorance are the major causes of environmental deterioration  whereas in industrialised countries that deterioration is due to their patterns of consumption and production. Therefore there is reason to hope that these positions will be harmonized in the context of preparations now under way for the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development.The Rwandese Republic voices the hope that in the critical area of the environment the international community will be able to close ranks and mobilize the intellectual and technical resources required to find solutions that will guarantee the survival of our planet. For its part  Rwanda  which has made the preservation of the environment one of its major priorities within the framework of its policy of food self-sufficiency  has undertaken significant actions in this area  such as the national campaign against erosion  the national reforestation effort and the national environmental strategy  to give only a few examples. The road is still long  of course  for a great deal remains to be done. This is why we are counting on international co-operation to meet the environmental challenges our country is encountering.My country  Rwanda  attaches particular importance to the preservation of its natural heritage and to environmental protection. The strengthening and maintenance of ecological balance require us to demonstrate further concern  day by day  for our national parks  our rivers  our lakes  our natural preserves  our forests  our habitat - in a word  for all the elements which make up our environment. Turning to the important question of democracy  a key element for generating · peace and development. I should like to explain my country's objectives to the General Assembly. Since the beginning of 1989  well before the political upheavals in Eastern Europe  Rwanda has been giving careful consideration to updating its political system. First on the agenda is the formulation of a new political manifesto  a national political charter redefining and setting forth in depth the new democratic rules as devised by the people of Rwanda and guaranteeing respect for democratic process and national cohesion.In the long term we shall also be reviewing our 1978 Constitution to establish a clear separation of powers and  above all  to enshrine the supremacy of the State over any political organization. A wide-ranging national dialogue will enable all the active forces of the Rwandan nation to state their position on all aspects of today's political issues.No less important than the problems I have already mentioned is that of my compatriots living outside Rwanda. As I have repeatedly said  the question of Rwandese refugees is primarily the responsibility of the Government and the people of Rwanda. However  in the light of its well-known problems  including those due to the small size of its territory and its population  Rwanda cannot by itself resolve this thorny and painful problem. We renew our appeal to the international community to find a lasting solution along three lines: voluntary repatriation; naturalization in the host country  also voluntary; and freedom of residence.My country welcomes the first World Summit for Children  which was held this weekend. I personally hail that initiative and congratulate the United Nations and  especially  the United Nations Children's Fund  on having brought it about.We all love our children. In Rwanda's philosophy of development and of the vital essence that gives us life and hope  children hold a central place  as they do in Bantu philosophy. Children have always been our raison d'etre and our highest and most important value.As we see it therefore  the advancement of the child is everything. It is related to basic medical care  the protection of mothers  the emancipation of women and economic security. It is related to family planning  access to essential services such as water  health  education  decent housing and self-sufficiency in food. It is also related to the defence of all recognised rights of the child as defined by the United Nations Convention on the nights of the Child. In that contest  Rwanda felt in duty bound to ratify that Convention immediately.Despite my Government's undeniable efforts  supported by the international community  and the genuine successes we have had thus far  Rwanda's situation with respect to the advancement of the child remains precarious. That is primarily because of the pressures of population density - amounting in some places to more than 1 000 people per square kilometre - on our agricultural resources. Kith unpredictable weather  this threatens  despite all our efforts  to push us ever closer to a permanent food shortage  which will  of course  affect the health of our children first and foremost.It remains precarious also because Rwanda and the great majority of other African countries cannot but feel the ill effects of our depressing economic situation and of the ceaseless succession of crises  each one worse than the last. In a flash these sweep away as much as three quarters of our export earnings  and thus of the resources we need to plan our development.The Declaration and Plan of Action of the Korid Summit for Children must address some of the fundamental constraints that violently block the thorough and lasting amelioration of our children's lives. Otherwise we risk missing the core of the problem that right to be the subject of that historic summit. These are the points I wanted to cover today. In conclusion  I reaffirm that the Rwandese Republic acknowledges the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace and justice and in the fight for solidarity and a better life for all the world's peoples. The people of Rwanda will never cease its support of the Organisation's quest for lasting solutions to the problems of our day."
"124",6046,"SAU",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  it is my honour to convey to you and to this august assembly the greetings of the guardian of the two holy sites  who had wished to be with you mid to speak to you in person. However  the conditions prevailing in the region have required that he remain in the Kingdom. We has entrusted me with the task of conveying to you the position of our Kingdom on the most important event in our region and the world at large. Mr. President  it is my pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency off this forty-fifth session off the General Assembly off the United Nations. It is a tribute to you personally and to your country and its important regional and international role. I am fully confident that your presidency off this session will be an effective factor in achieving the objectives to which the international community aspires in these difficult international circumstances.I avail myself off this opportunity to extend thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  the President off the forty-fourth General Assembly off the United Nations. We conducted its deliberations  as well as the deliberations off the special sessions during the past year with efficiency  wisdom and effectiveness  for which he deserves praise and appreciation.It also gives me pleasure to express thanks and appreciation to His Excellency  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his persistent and distinguished efforts in the service of the cause of international peace and security  and his endeavours to develop the role and effectiveness of the United Nations for the realisation of the high objectives for which it was established.It is also my pleasure to welcome Liechtenstein to the membership off this international organisation  coupled with our hope that its entry will consolidate the effectiveness and universality of joint international action  and our wishes to its friendly people for prosperity and progress.We stand here today on the threshold of an overwhelming danger with a situation that teeters between the drums of war and the bells of peace. Coming to you from the heart off the Arab land  the cradle of Islam  the seat off the two holy mosques and the abode off the messenger off God  I cannot but set out by saying ""peace be upon you."" That is the call for peace and friendship exchanged by every Arab and every Muslim when they meet.We would have wished for the continuation of the march of peace that accompanied the previous session of the General Assembly. Since we net here last year  there have been glimpses of hope and the emergence of the beginnings of a new international order  whose mainstay is co-operation between countries  and understanding between peoples. The intifadah of the steadfast Palestinian people in the occupied territories was illuminating the road towards the hoped for solution. It captivated the hearts of peoples and touched their conscience. The Iraq-Iran war came to an end  and we had begun to look forward to a new era of peace and concord in the region of the Gulf. Namibia won its independence  and the march towards the elimination of apartheid in South Africa began. International conflicts began to move towards resolution. We carried the banner of establishing co-operation in the region  a region vibrant with suffering and hope  so that States should enjoy stability and so that peoples should live in prosperity. However  catastrophe took us by surprise. Events took place that were thought to be impossible in the past.As we stand with you today in this international forum  grief overcomes us for what the State of Kuwait  a dear and neighbourly sister State  is being subjected to.	·We listened  as did you  here  a few days ago  to His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed M-Sabah  the Emir of the State of Kuwait  who conveyed to us in his historic statement a vivid and comprehensive picture of the catastrophe which befell brotherly Kuwait. The eloquent words of His Highness have stirred everybody's conscience. In this esteemed international gathering  they have evoked feelings of participation  firm solidarity and effective support. When the sudden aggression of the Iraqi regime dispersed the people of Kuwait  violated the country  pillaged its assets and want far beyond all the limits of trust; when it invaded and occupied the brotherly neighbour  Kuwait  and amassed forces on the borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  Iraq deviated from the Arab order based on the charter of the League of Arab States and deviated from the world order by violating the Charter of the United Nations.All peoples and Governments of the world have rejected the aggression. It has been condemned by the League of Arab States  deplored by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and reproached by the Non-Aligned Movement. As for the Security Council  it has monitored the invasion and occupation  rejected it in all its aspects from the very first day and adopted the necessary resolutions to oppose this invasion and erase its effects.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken a firm stand in rejecting this aggression  with all its consequences and effects. The rulers of Iraq bear the responsibility of its results and consequences. Today  Saudi Arabia declares from this rostrum of international legitimacy that it stands with the whole world in opposition to the continued occupation. From this rostrum we extend a salute of admiration and esteem to the people of brotherly Kuwait  and from this rostrum w® declare our firm rejection of the occupation by any State of the lands of another State by force of arms. We declare our firm insistence on the immediate unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the territory of Kuwait  the restitution of Kuwait's legitimate Government and the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.We had spared no effort in trying to contain the dispute that transpired between the two neighbouring sister States  Kuwait and Iraq. The Kingdom hosted a number of eminent officials from the two countries at the Jeddah meeting. Our objective  arising from the national responsibility of the Kingdom and the dictates of its Islamic religion and lofty Arab ideals  was to arrive at a solution in a brotherly fashion and on the basis of an understanding that would have prevented events from deteriorating.Regrettably  the Kingdom was taken by surprise by the Iraqi regime's invasion of Kuwait and the flagrant aggression against its sovereignty  its people and its possessions. We were taken by surprise  again most regrettably  by the build-up which the Iraqi regime has brought in proximity to the Kingdom's international borders.The Kingdom has risen above the wounds and the ""injustice of kinsmen"" and preferred patience in the hope that the Iraqi leadership would reconsider and withdraw. But the Iraqi leadership followed up by declaring the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq and amassed its armed forces in offensive formations along our country's borders  thus again violating conventions and laws after it had violated traditions and revoked promises  exposing the Kingdom's security to extreme danger and threatening international peace and security.We Arabs  we in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  do not break faith nor do we accept threats. Thus our leadership has taken firm decisions that will ensure the protection of both land and men  the protection of vital economic assets and the consolidation of defensive capabilities.The Kingdom was particular  at the most critical and threatening time  to initiate its steps on the basis of a genuine commitment to conventions treaties; for Saudi Arabia  which participated in the founding of the United Nations  could find no alternative for self-defence but to rely on Article 51 of the Charter. The Kingdom  which participated in the building up of the League of Arab States  could find no alternative in opposing the threatening invader but to rely on the treaty of mutual Arab defence. And as a founding member of the Arab Gulf States Co-operation Council  it could not find any alternative in facing up to the absorption of a sister Gulf State but to rely on the Gulf Co-operation Council's charter. The Kingdom  a founding State and the host of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference  could find no alternative but to rely on the charter of that Organisation. Our leadership has carried out its responsibilities and accounted for the anticipated development of events so that the Kuwait catastrophe could not recur and so that it will not be taken by surprise at the hands of adventurism.Arab  Islamic and other friendly States hurried to the support of Saudi Arabia's armed forces in performing the duty of defending the State and the safety of its citizens.We have given assurances that the presence of sisterly and friendly forces on Saudi territory is a temporary one. It was in response to our request. We have given assurances and were assured that this is a measure for defence only. It was necessitated by circumstances that were concocted by the ruling regime in Iraq and will come to an end with the reversal of the circumstances that made it necessary. In spite of this  we were very patient.In its persistent Arab desire for peace  the Kingdom participated with the Arab family in the search for an Arab solution. It responded to the invitation of President Mubarak  President of the Arab Republic of Egypt  to attend the emergency Arab summit conference - which was held in Cairo on 19 Muharram  1411 A.H.  corresponding to 9 August 1990 - which resulted in the desired Arab resolution. But the government of Iraq did not respond. Instead  it displayed an arrogant behaviour towards Arab and international legality by insisting on not reversing its annexation and occupation.We Arabs  we in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  wonder how can an Arab solution be reached of the ruins of another Arab State? How can solution be reached when the government of Iraq has blocked every avenue that may lead to it? How can we join the international march towards new international co-operation if we forgive the usurpation by one Arab State of another Arab land? To us  the acceptable solution is the one based on Arab legitimacy and on the charter of the League of Arab States. It is the solution that arises from official institution  represented by the Arab summit conference and the Ministerial Conference  of the League of Arab States. We Arabs are a people who value friendship and commitment. God has honoured us by bringing us the message of Islam. With mingled humility and pride  we have raised the banner of justice  helping the oppressed and rescuing the anxious. We have always risen above the violation of our neighbours' rights  upheld the sanctity of our brethren and felt that pillaging for spoils is beneath our dignity. Those are our genuine Arab morals and the magnanimous Islamic principles that are our code of behaviour as Arabs and Saudi Arabians. It is neither acceptable nor reasonable to apply to our behaviour or actions as Arabs norms and standards that are lower than those of other nations. God has endowed our Arab nation with the message  thus making it the best nation raised up among mankind. Our nation prescribes what is righteous and forbids what is evil. God has honoured it with Islam and thus it carried the torch of civilisation and knowledge to all the other nations and spread the principles of mercy  sympathy  solidarity  justice and fairness among peoples. Hence  the Arab nation must set an example by adhering to the civilised moral behaviour which stems from its high ideals and lofty principles.It is an honour to me to extend the profound thanks and appreciation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to our brethren in the Arab States  our brethren in the Islamic countries and to those friendly States in the five continents - exceeding 26 in number - which have come to the support of the Saudi Arabian armed forces. The Kingdom's dependence is on God Almighty above all else. Almighty God is B· who protects us and our people from all harm. We rely on the faithfulness and dutifulness of our people  and then on the brethren and friends who have hastened to protect peace in the land of amity and peace.We sought to build the strength of Iraq. We are intent on sustaining and preserving that strength. However  we want a strong Iraq that protects the Arab countries  an Iraq that would be the mainstay of Arab national security  not an Iraq that threatens the security of Arab countries and strives to undermine the foundations of Arab order.An Iraq that commits aggression against a neighbouring sister country  violates its sanctity  squanders its potential and threatens the entire Arab order cannot be counted as a force for the Arabs. Rather  it is actually a source of discord and division in the Arab ranks. It weakens and enfeebles the Arab body.We cannot allow the Iraqi regime's adventure to veil the glow of the principal Arab cause: the Palestinian cause. It pains us that attention is being diverted from the intifadah of the heroic Palestinian people  that the search for a just solution to the Palestinian cause should retrogress and that the dangers posed by Jewish immigration to the occupied territories should cause no outcry or protest. It pains us even more that the Iraqi regime  which claims a monopoly over the salvation of Palestine should follow Israel's example of occupying the land  dispersing its people and refusing to withdraw. It has even given Israel an international pretext to consecrate occupation  empty the homeland of its people and replace them with immigrants. It is for the sake of Palestine that Iraq should withdraw from Kuwait; it is for the sake of Palestine that it should abide by the dictates of international legitimacy so that we may move international legality to achieve for the people of Palestine what  God willing  will be achieved for the people of Kuwait.Irrespective of the circumstances  we welcomed the settlement finally reached in the situation between Iraq and Iran following a decade of war. We ask that it be followed by a similar step with respect to Kuwait. We who hastens to seek peace with an adversary will suffer no embarrassment if he rushes to be responsive to a brother. The serious damage inflicted by the Iraqi aggression against	haseconomic  social and human dimensions whose effects are not confined to the Middle East region. Those effects have repercussions for most of the countries of the world.The international community’s solid stand on the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait and the firm solidarity demonstrated by the countries of the world in facing up to that aggression with all its results and effects must be accompanied alto by effective co-operation with the States which have suffered as a result of the aggression  due to their staunch unflinching adherence to the Security Council resolutions  especially to those relating to economic sanctions and the embargo against Iraq.Within the framework of that co-operation and in a spirit of international responsibility  Saudi Arabia  in co-operation with its partners in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  has adopted an oil-production policy that will compensate as much as possible for the interruption of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports and will make the greatest possible effort to maintain stable and reasonable prices.The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given urgent financial and development assistance to many of the countries that have suffered due toaggression. In addition to the support announced at the United Nations for Turkey  Egypt and Jordan  we look forward to the extension of that support to include Syria  Lebanon  Pakistan  Bangladesh  Somalia  Djibouti and many other countries proven to have suffered.Countries which have stood up honourably and steadfastly to the Iraqi aggression  participated actively in implementing economic sanctions and  as a result  have borne financial  economic and social burdens deserve the appreciation and care of the entire world community. Thus  Saudi Arabia expresses its satisfaction at the steps taken by the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at their joint Meeting held last week in Washington to establish a co-ordinating group to assist the affected countries. We have expressed our readiness to participate actively in that direction. We would have liked to be able to deal in detail with the other critical issues which we have participated in addressing over the past few years  namely  the continuous search for opportunities for peace in the Middle East  the international support for the heroes of the intifadah in the occupied territories  the Taif Agreement  the hopes of Arabs for Lebanon  the hopes for a peaceful solution for Afghanistan  and many other common aspirations. However  the preoccupation of the international community with the Gulf crisis is almost monopolising the efforts of the Security Council and the General Assembly to avoid a catastrophe  We all know how the crisis started and we all hope that it will end on the basis of international legitimacy.The international position is crystal clear. There is no ambiguity or vagueness about it. The successive Security Council resolutions have articulated that position  and it was confirmed again a few days ago by the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Security Council in their joint statement following their meeting with the United Nations Secretary-General.Therefore  there is no need for vacillation between word and deed or contradictions between declaration and implementation. There is no place for alternative proposals or for the circulating of initiatives which achieve nothing but a waste of time. The soundness of any position cannot be judged by the condemnation of the invasion alone but also on the basis of the proper choice of solution. Any solution cannot be complete except by preventing the aggressor from reaping the fruits of his aggression. When the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia declares its firm commitment to Security Council resolutions  it believes in the steadfastness of the international will: the cohesion of the international stand will force the rulers of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and lead to the restitution of the legitimate Government of Kuwait. Forty-five years ago  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated in the founding of an international order which emerged from the shattered ruins of the Second World War. It participated in founding this Organization  the United Nations  which emerged after the collapse of the League o£ Nations due to the lack of the international will to stand up to the usurpation of one of its Member States.If the situation in our region today causes concern  we look to the future with determination and hope. The Kingdom undertakes to participate effectively in the vistas that will open up towards a new international order.At this critical phase through which our Arab world in passing  we must learn the lesson from what has happened in order for us to avoid the possibility of its taking place again; otherwise tragedies will recur in a region full of probabilities. The wheel of time must continue to turn  the caravan must continue to march  and the march must proceed.In looking to the future  we turn first and foremost to our brethren in the occupied Arab territories and to the dispersed Palestinian people who are scattered all over the world; and we say to them: ""Your cause is our cause. Let us rise in our hearts and by our deeds above the Arab disputes and divisions  for they are the focal place and the axis of gravitation."" We say to them: ""Stand as a solid barrier against those who attempt to exploit your feelings or to feed on your wrath in older to harm the Arab body  your body."" We say to them  ""Support legitimacy  for it is the support of your cause  the cause of all Arabs  and the base which guarantees your legitimate rights in liberating the land and establishing the State."" We say to them today  more so than at any other time  ""Let us preserve firm solidarity."" We in the Arab world  in Saudi Arabia  say that our commitment towards the people of Palestine was not born today  nor was it born yesterday. It was born with the first heartbeat of the cause. Our solidarity with the Palestinian people will continue today and tomorrow and until victory is achieved  for Jerusalem is the first of our two Kiblahs  and the Al-Aqsa mosque is the third after the two holy mosques.We regard the aspirations of our Arab nation after a better future as the first priority. We realize that this nation must invest all its material and Inman resources in the march towards development  prosperity and progress  and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will spare no effort in working towards the achievement of that objective. In the area of development  we did not fail to co-operate with our brethren in the Arab world nor did we fall short of fulfilling our obligations towards them. We have participated in the efforts for comprehensive Arab development even when our material resources were limited. Before the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran war we had more available resources that would have enabled us to offer a larger volume of development assistance. However  that long war consumed them. Despite the decline in the revenues that that war caused  it is the right of the Arab citizen to wonder today over the causes of the diminished Arab development efforts in realizing his aspirations and ambitions. Maybe we have a lesson to derive from the experience of Eastern European countries which have proved that the malaise lies in the sterility of the structure of economic policies rather than in the lack of resources  despite their significance. The solution should come through developing those structures and improving those policies while providing the necessary resources. In the face of this reality  we are required today to put the Arab house in order and organize our relations on the regional and universal Arab levels. We must reach for appropriate solutions to deal with the imbalance that has afflicted the Arab order  so that it can regain its health and required balance.Perhaps the forecast issue we should review is the method of economic co-operation between the Arab States. Although it is not our habit to boast about our assistance to our brethren  the lesson we have derived from what has happened is that co-operation should be through Arab institutions which operate in a secure  scientific manner which the Arab citizen can perceive and judge.We are part of this world in which we live. Therefore  the resources with which God has endowed the Arab world are not for our benefit alone  but should benefit the whole world at large. While we  as Arabs  acknowledge the need for the world's co-operation  we believe that the rest of the world realizes that it is necessary to co-operate with us.In the final analysis  our Arab world cannot remain alone outside the orbit of the accelerating new trends which are altering the balance of relations between States  nations and peoples.We are part of this world - a world which is today turning away from polarisation  tension and division. We are with this world in its new endeavour to overcome crises  to overcome unresolved problems and to build a new world of co-operation  understanding  freedom and peace.In this we begin with ourselves. We bear our responsibilities towards our region and this new world. 1c is a duty in which both responsible leaders and responsible citizens participate. And while rulers handle the functions of State and the citizen faces the problems of daily life  all of us must build the contours of our future path.We have always called for a unified Arab strategy which plans for a common future and which avoids volatile emotional reactions. From a position of responsibility  we call on the opinion makers  we call on Arab intellectuals to participate in this endeavour  for they have to bear their responsibilities in supporting the new Arab order as the opportunity for education opens up in the Arab nation - every Arab citizen and every responsible citizen. Every official has a duty and every intellectual has a place. We all have one objective which is a decent life for the Arab individual. The individual is the real asset  the individual is the pulse of the nation for the future. In this very Hall  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated  with the distinguished gathering of Heads of member States  in the international declaration on children's rights. We were elated by the children as they stood with us  with their innocence and enthusiasm  the children who themselves declared the children's charter  the dream of today and the hope for tomorrow.As we enter a new decade with the world - a new decade that leads us to a new century  the twenty-first century  we share in confronting the concerns of today  and we look forward to participating in making the dreams of tomorrow come true. We endeavour in our region to ensure that the revitalised Arab order should be in step with the new world order. We endeavour in our region to ensure that the gateways of the new order - the new world - should be open to the aspirations of States and the hopes of peoples - a new world of co-operation understanding and justice. This new world  which resolutely and persistently affirms the enduring rights of nations to independence on their soil  and which rejects the logic of force  annexation and occupation is a world that believes in tolerance and dialogue between nations and rejects the logic of apartheid and the methods of oppression and expulsion. This new world in the service of which the means of learning and the discoveries of modern science abound  must ensure the social and economic justice which would make possible the realisation of progress and prosperity for nations and ensure security and stability for the world.In all this  we are inspired by the Charter which we signed and to which we have been committed from the very outset.Today we continue to be faithful to that Charter. We are with the Charter of the United Nations  with the Charter of the League of Arab States  with the Charter of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council  with the Charter of the Organisation of the Islamic and we are with the Charter of the Non-Aligned Movement.

"125",6083,"SDN",45,1990,"﻿Allow me to begin by congratulating you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations in this session. Your election reflects the confidence that the international community places in you  and is a tribute to your country Malta We are very confident that under your wise guidance the General Assembly in its current session will achieve positive results aimed at the reinforcement of international co-operation and understanding among peoples. We wish you all the best in your endeavours.Allow me also to express the deep gratitude of the delegation of Sudan to your predecessor. His Excellency General Joseph Garba  a dedicated son of Africa  who has shown considerable wisdom and skill in his stewardship of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.We should also like to renew our thanks and appreciation to Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for Ms incessant efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security  indeed  for the dignity and well-being of mankind.It is  indeed  most gratifying for us to see an independent Namibia as a Member of the United Nations  following a hard and protracted struggle on the part of its people and a solid international backing which finally made its independence possible. We have no doubt that young Namibia will contribute actively to the work of our Organisation. We also welcome the Principality of Liechtenstein  the latest Member of the United Nations.We also wish to express a very special welcome to our brethren in Yemen on the occasion of Yemen's unity into one strong sovereign State. We trust that this great achievement by our brothers will reflect positively in all endeavours of the international community and organisations. Within the same framework  we should like to welcome the forthcoming unification of Germany. My country has recently witnessed a series of festivities on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Revolution for National Salvation  a revolution which  since its inception  has shown unwavering determination to offer the people of Sudan an opportunity to rise above all their sectarian and tribal differences  which wore exacerbated by the previous regime. The people of Sudan are now free to choose the political system which best suits them without any pressure or diktat.The Revolution for National Salvation has been logical in that it made peace its first priority. Peace is the necessary prelude to the improvement of Sudan's conditions and preparing it to play its natural role on the regional and international levels.Having decided not to address any issue without the full participation of the people of the country  the Revolution has convened a Conference of National Dialogue on the issues of peace in the country. All national forces participated in that Conference  and were able to make recommendations on the ways and means of consolidating the country's unity  power sharing  the distribution of wealth and the relationship between religion and the State within the framework of a federal system wherein citizenship will be the basis of belonging to a unified Sudan.The State has adopted the recommendations of the Conference  in which the peoples of both the north and the south participated  and  without any attendant  formulated upon that basis a programme for negotiations. Not surprisingly  the rebel movement accepted the programme as a workable basis for negotiation in the meeting that took place in Nairobi in December 1989 between representatives of the Government and the rebel movement. Several National Dialogue Conferences followed one another on such issues &s the economy  diplomacy  information  social development  women and the problems of education  including the issue of illiteracy. Other conferences addressed the problems of the most vulnerable groups of the population  including the problems of displaced persons  refugees  childhood and motherhood  h wider political conference is now addressing the issue of democracy. The aim is to come up with a democratic formula of full popular participation that would enable the people to exercise democratic rule without tutelage. The Revolution has taken it upon itself to ensure the human  political  social and economic rights of the people in line with the dictates of all religions and the norms embodied in the international covenants on human rights and democracy.All this has been taking place within the framework of Sudan's culture and heritage. Our civilisation has led us towards an openness to the cultures and identities of others in order to forge a common human civilisation. Recognising that human dignity cannot be realised without securing all the requirements of such dignity  the Revolution has become aware that economics is the central factor among those components. Therefore  we have made the restructuring of the national economy a first priority  the objective being to secure and liberalise all sectors of the economy with full popular participation. Development of human resources has also become the basis for comprehensive development.Towards that end  the Revolution has adopted a three-year programme of economic salvation. It has also promulgated a new law on investment. A number of Arab and foreign development partners have been invited to participate in reviewing the draft of that law before its promulgation  to ensure a feeling of security for their investments on their part.Sudan's keenness to promote peace is not limited to its national borders. The yearning for peace has been extended to embrace relations with all our neighbours particularly in the Horn of Africa. This we have done in the context of a just  humane perspective  which respects good neighbourliness  and which is based on a strong foundation of durable peace  in order to allow the people of this region to unify their wills and endeavours to develop their region. This would only b· achieved by exploring the root causes of conflicts in the region in a collective manner in order to formulate feasible solutions. I am  therefore  pleased to say that Sudan has received a very positive response from all the leaders of the sub-region  we have also been encouraged by those friends who are keen to achieve peace and security in the sub-region. I am confident that the member countries of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) will pursue their collective efforts to achieve peace and development for all their people. There is no doubt that the acceleration of economic co-operation between the countries of the region  with the support of our friends  will have a positive impact on the prospects of durable peace in the region.The successive indicators of international détente  especially over the past two years  have given rise to real hope and created opportunities in all the areas of international development  especially in the developing countries and more particularly in the least developed countries. This will naturally narrow the present gap between the North and the South. An outstanding landmark in that direction has been the guest for the reduction of arms and armaments expenditures The Middle East witnessed an easing of tension when the guns of Iraq-Iran were silenced and successful negotiations were initiated by our brethren in Iraq to reach a final solution to that war in order to eliminate all its after-effects In accordance with international legality and respect for the Charter  as well as the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. By doing this  Iraq served the cause of peace. However  there is now cause for concern. War threatens once again and the presence of foreign fleets in the Gulf is a grave development that warrants such concern  both on our part and on the part of all those who are interested in peace and who foresee the devastating consequences that may arise from shifting the conflict from the search for peaceful solutions in an Arab framework to a confrontation whose consequences cannot be predicted.Sudan's position on this grave situation is the following. First  efforts must be pursued towards the achievement of a peaceful solution to the present conflict between Iraq and Kuwait within an Arab Muslin from work that would lead to the elimination of the root causes of their differences.Secondly  Sudan is fully committed to the principles of international law and legality  the Charter of the United Nations and the charters of the League of Arab States and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Sudan has clearly and emphatically reiterated this commitment at every Arab Meeting that has been held on the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. Sudan's main concern is to avert a devastating war in the region and to spare the Kuwaiti people further suffering and enable them to resume their natural place in both Arab and international communities. On more than one occasion  we have affirmed our commitment to the Security Council resolutions on this crisis. I now reaffirm that commitment.Thirdly  Sudan wishes to express its deep regret that this should have happened between two Arab sister States. We also realise that this complex situation has developed into an imminent threat to Arab national security. This threat  as we have often said  is the intensive foreign military presence in the region  that is a prelude to the imposition of a new security order. That new security order will not take into account the requirements of national Arab security. It will be aimed at safeguarding the interests of foreign States in the region without any regard for the security of the countries of the region. It will impose upon the region a pattern of peace that cannot be compatible with the aspirations of the Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights  including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State in their homeland  Palestine.Fourthly  in the light of the preceding three points  Sudan has taken initiatives  including visits by the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation to several Arab States with the object of closing ranks and the determination to contain the crisis within an Arab framework and prevent the penetration of foreign forces into our region  we wish to reaffirm our strong desire to achieve peace and security for our brethren  the people of Kuwait. Furthermore  we are completely convinced that an approach of military confrontation will not solve the problem. We are equally convinced that it runs counter to all international norms and humanitarian principles to impose a complete blockade against Iraq  and thus deprive Iraqis of food and medicine.Fifthly  we continue to believe that this is an Arab problem and that as such it should be contained within an Arab framework. The possibilities of an Arab solution are still available despite the difficulties created by an imposed foreign intervention in the region.Fro  this rostrum we call for giving that Arab solution a further chance to achieve a durable settlement that could be made possible through peaceful negotiation and would thus avert the threat of war in the region and spare humanity the consequences of a devastating military confrontation.We should all strive with a unified will to achieve lasting peace in the Gulf region. We should also silence the drums of war which some are so intent on beating.We continue to believe that responsibility for resolving this crisis is  of necessity  collective. Mo single State or group of States has the right to take it upon itself to implement Security Council resolutions with its arsenals and infantry  marine and air forces  without such forces being part of a peace-keeping force established by the Security Council pursuant to Articles 41  42 and 43 of Chapter VII of the Charter. Any action outside those articles would amount to an extremely dangerous precedent.We appreciate the concern shown by international economic and financial organisations and a number of States with regard to the negative economic impact of the Gulf crisis especially on the non-oil producing States  and the least developed countries. We also appreciate the readiness shown by those States and organisations to mitigate the negative impact of the crisis brought about by the rise in oil prices and the resultant increase in the prices of manufactured goods and production inputs have direct affect the life and development processes of a great number of nations at a time when they need to accelerate their development efforts. We look forward to seeing this objective point of view translated into a program  of action and into inflows of resources to the developing nations. We also hope that it will be included in the resolutions that will be adopted at this session of the General Assembly.The international community is still confronted with a number of issues of great importance. We should face up to them with practical measures and a strong united political will. The explosive situation in the Middle East continues to be neglected and marginalised. Some States have made their first concern the defence of Israel. Some permanent members of the Security Council use their right of veto in a way incompatible with the principles of international law and the provisions of our Charter.Four consecutive sessions of the General Assembly have passed while the Palestinian intifidah has been escalating  and every day the Palestinian people heroically prove their firm steadfastness and determination to regain their full and inalienable rights. Adherence to international instruments on human rights and the rights of nations requires the international community to respect that struggle against occupation  injustice and oppression that trample all international and human norms. This regrettable situation makes it imperative for the international community  represented in this Assembly  to take a clear position against the increasing waves of Jewish Migrants fro  the Soviet Union and other countries and their settlement in the occupied Arab territories. We affirm our support for the id   of placing the occupied Arab territories under direct international trusteeship to safeguard the Palestine  of the Palestinian people in the Palestinian territories  to preserve their integrity  safeguard their inalienable rights and protect then from oppressive Israeli practices  which have gone far beyond all reasonable limits.The people of Sudan  along with all the other peoples of the African continent  follow with keen interest the first victories of the people of South Africa. We welcome the release from prison of the great freedom fighter Nelson Mandela and others. We also welcome the unbanning of anti-apartheid organisations including the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist congress of Azania. On the question of political and economic sanctions  Sudan calls on the international community to keep the sanctions in place against the racist regime until such time as apartheid has been completely dismantled and a free  democratic and non-racial South Africa has emerged.One of the most important pending problems before the international community concerns the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. My delegation regrets that the international community has failed thus far to adopt measures that would strengthen the security of non-nuclear States or guarantee that nuclear weapons will not be used against them by those who do possess such weapons.Conventional weapons continue to develop both in the terms of quantity and of destructiveness. They still find their way to the markets of arms developing countries. We have not yet succeeded in realising the clear relationship between disarmament and development. It seems to us that that role of the United Nations is being marginalized  in the field of disarmament. Multilateral negotiations have not been accorded the importance they merit.0n the economic level  we have not yet succeeded in implementing the major programme of action for the 1980s in favour of the least developed countries. International co-operation for the eradication of poverty in the developing countries continues to be an unattained dream. The influx of refugees contains to grow into the host countries including Sudan. We cannot ignore the heavy burden Imposed on our country by that influx of refugees  who are pouring across our eastern and western borders. The spectre of drought and the continued conflicts in neighbouring countries will generate new waves of refugees. We  therefore  call on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in support of Sudan in this important human domain in the light of the fact that the Sudanese people are offering all they can without asking for gratitude. The fact is that the Sudan shoulders some 70 per cent of the cost of sheltering refugees in spite all its difficult economic and social circumstances.The international community is still unable to combat the growing scourge of narcotic drugs in many communities throughout the world  while most developing countries continue to quake at the dangers posed by poverty  hunger and disease.Problems arising from the deterioration of the environment continue to be a source of serious concern. This should lead to greater international co-operation on reaching new goals commensurate with the gravity of the dangers arising from that deterioration.We have repeatedly affirmed that the development of the developing countries is first and foremost the responsibility of those countries. We have held to that commitment  but we continue to believe that international support is necessary in the process of development and of raising the standard of living in those countries. We in Sudan harm accepted that the responsibility for alleviating the suffering of our people is ours and have considered every possible option to deal with the economic crisis we face. This has resulted in the formulation of a three-year programme for economic salvation aired at restructuring the Sudanese economy through the revitalisation of all economic sectors  the rationalisation of the use of disposable resources  the achievement of social balance  and the alleviation of the suffering of the poorer segments of the population. We can achieve those objectives by: more emphasis on development in the agricultural sector with a view to the achievement of self-sufficiency in food and in agro-industry in general  the encouragement of an export drive through a liberalisation process  the elimination of bureaucratic impediments  and the mobilisation of all available domestic and foreign resources to increase production and improve efficiency.All this can be achieved only if we eliminate obstacles to investment and encourage the private sector to make a positive contribution to national development. Nor can such efforts bear fruit without a favourable international economic environment in which the international community accepts its responsibility vis-à-vis the elimination of all the difficulties which stand in the way of growth and development in the developing countries.The debt problems remain an ongoing problem of both debtors and creditors  Debtors are over burdened by a debt service problem which hampers their development and loads to complete and utter poverty. Creditors  on the other hand  are no longer able to recover their loans In our country  the debt burden has reached the point where it threatens the entire structure of our economy. No have adopted various measure  aimed at mitigating the chronic deficit in our balance of payments. Among those measures is the limiting of our imports to the extent necessary for development  the encouragement of exports in order to increase our export earnings and the reduction of public expenditures even though such cuts will have adverse effects which our people will have to suffer. However  those measures are not sufficient by themselves and cannot lead to an overall solution to the crisis. We hope the international community will face up to its responsibilities and increase its participation in the efforts aimed at resolving this problem  and thus match the earnestness of our policies and the firmness of the measures we have taken despite their heavy burden they will impose on our people. The problem is too serious to be left solely to the international financial institutions. In saying this  I am voicing a joint African position on the problem of indebtedness  a problem  which have clearly become a grave crisis that threatens the prospects of development and the very life of the developing nations. We appreciate the encouraging initiatives of some donor countries  toward reduction of the debt burden. We hope that this spirit will inspire the hole international community to follow their example  so that we can put an end to this problem which is a great obstacle to economic and social growth in our countries.  An effective solution for such a severe problem requires a positive response and genuine action to encourage a sufficient flow of resources and expertise to the developing countries  in order to expand their absorptive capacities and accelerate their development. Resolving the problem further requires that action be taken to improve the terms of trade in the international arena and open additional outlets for the exports of developing countries by removing restrictions on their foreign trade.All of the foregoing is required to adjust the balance of power and the terms of trade in favour of the developing countries and also to bridge the current development gap between the North and the South. There is no need to elaborate on the expected positive results from all these factors  that is  the achievement of balance in international development and the ensuing international stability and security.The effects of all those problems I have just referred to will reflect harshly and bitterly on children  particularly in developing countries. In relation to the question of indebtedness  for example  son  children will pay the price of never seeing the light of life  others will suffer from poverty and preventable diseases because their poor families cannot afford vaccines and medication. At this crucial time  it is a sign of hope and optimism that the World Summit for Children has been convened here at the United Nations. This summit meeting indicates that the international community  represented by the political leaders of all countries  is still capable of making a humanitarian gesture in the interest of a new and prosperous future for children. The summit’s declaration  plan of action and political commitment represents a historic humanitarian lead that can be put to effect only by the will and determination of the international community collectively and every country individually to implement those two important international instruments. I should like to declare Sudan's firm commitment to strive  on its own and in co-operation with others  to put children first in every casa.Sudan  while it continues to face severe economic and social problems  like many other developing countries  also suffered a number of natural and environmental disasters over the past few years. It still feels the effects of those calamities.Natural disasters and the war waged by the rebel movement in the southern part of my country have taken their toll on our food supplies  which depend to a great extent on uncontrollable climatic conditions. In the two preceding agricultural seasons  the rainfall was below the normal average. At present  signs of drought which are beginning to appear in the northern part of our country  threaten to create food shortages and therefore increase our apprehension. The situation in the neighbouring countries is no better and  therefore  we fear that there may be a new influx of refugees into Sudan in the near future. It is also possible that a one of our food nay find its way into neighbouring countries. Mindful of all this  we expeditiously requested the expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations in order to determine scientifically the food position in our country for the coming year.Sudan is proud to be the initiator of an unprecedented initiative which is indicative of its concern for all its citizens in all circumstances  be it in times of war or in times of peace. That initiative baa allowed for the first time in recorded history the smooth flow of food and Medicine to citizens in the areas of military operations through a number of safe-passage corridors  in pursuance of Sudan's desire to protect all its citizens regardless of location or attitude.All those efforts were undertaken within the framework of Operation life-line Sudan  for which we extend our appreciation to the international community represented by the United Nations  its Secretary-General and his senior relief assistants and the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund who was assigned the duty of supervising that successful operation  which stands as an example of the huge capabilities of international humanitarian co-operation. We laud the role of the international community  which became a partner with Sudan in that historic operation. We look forward to more positive international co-operation in support of phase 2 of Operation Life-Line Sudan  which relates to rehabilitation and construction in the light of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in that regard.We have discussed sincerely the international and regional problems of concern to Sudan and the international community. We have also dealt with the problems  hopes and aspirations of Sudan with frankness and sincerity  so that all these issues may figure in the deliberations and resolutions of this session. We have come here to reaffirm our unwavering confidence in the United Nations and in international co-operation for the achievement of a more just and prosperous future for all.We should like to assure all Members of the Assembly of the firm commitment of Sudan to remain an active participant in international co-operation and in the enhancement of efforts towards the achievement of world peace and human development. "
"126",6128,"SEN",45,1990,"﻿The delegation of Senegal warmly congratulates the President on his election to guide the work of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. In addition to being a tribute paid to your country for its commitment to peace and justice  this wise choice consecrates his long experience in international affairs and his intellectual  human and moral qualities. It is true that we will have to take up some sizeable challenges during this session  but we are convinced that under his guidance our work will be successful. We may count on the delegation of Senegal to be at his disposal to assist him  to its modest best  as he carries out his difficult mission.To his illustrious predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba  Minister of State of Nigeria  I would like to reaffirm my delegation's satisfaction at the effective and skilful manner in which he guided the Assembly's work at its forty-fourth regular session and its sixteenth  seventeenth and eighteenth special sessions  In so doing  he gave honour to all Africa. Let him find here a renewed expression of my delegation's warm and sincere congratulations.It is also a pleasure for me to acclaim the constant efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  to promote peace and security everywhere and to give the United Nations a stronger image  that of an Organization is ever stronger and more credible because it is capable of saying what is right and defending the independence and sovereignty of its Members.I should also like to emphasise and welcome the ever growing universality of our Organisation. The presence of Namibia and Liechtenstein in this Assembly  which we acclaim with joy and pride  is yet another dazzling illustration of this. Namibia  which today is independent  needs constant support from the international community to solve  inter alia  the problems related to rebuilding its economy and restoring its territorial integrity. Senegal has given it such support  and we have no doubt that the United Nations  which  particularly through the Council for Namibia  played a decisive role in that country's independence process will give it all the desired support.I should like  finally  to welcome the presence in our midst of reunified Yemen  and to express again our sincerest wishes for the Yemeni people's stability and prosperity·Yesterday  3 October  a crucial page in post-Second-World-War history was turned. I refer to the peaceful unification of Germany. This historic event - a symbol of success and dynamism - should mark the dawn of a new eve where co-operation and understanding will prevail over the old confrontations on our planet.Thus  the unprecedented joint efforts that have replaced stubborn antagonisms between the super-Powers herald the coming of a new political order. The wind of freedom  which had begun to blow in Eastern Europe during our last session  is now blowing harder and spreading. At the same time  the doors have been opened to solving a large number of regional conflicts  and pertly opened to settling certain others.Today more than ever before we have reason to hope that we shall see the birth of a new world order  in which solutions to conflicts will be found through multilateral diplomacy in the service of our common security.But  it is merely hope that is involved and not yet reality  because a world of peace  solidarity and justice is not yet here. One might even say that doubt is wining over our mind because of the resurgence of nationality problems in one place; the persistence of old conflicts  which continue to elude solution in another place; civil wars and threats of regional conflicts in yet other places. Global peace and collective security remain goals for the attainment of which much effort still needs to be made.We have just been tragically reminded of this by the events in the Gulf region. There  in defiance of international law and in violation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations  one country  Iraq  invaded another  Kuwait  and decided to annex it outright. Senegal  which criticized and condemned this inadmissible act  is already acting in conformity with all the Security Council resolutions  and repeats here its firm commitment to support any other measures taken within the United Nations to end the aggression against the sovereignty and independence of Kuwait  a State with which Senegal is linked by solid  close relations of friendship and co-operation.Ending this aggression means  at the same time  ensuring the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from occupied Kuwait  restoring the legitimate Government of that country  headed by His Highness Emir Sheikh Al-Ahmad AΙ-Jaber AΙ-Sabah and obtaining the immediate release of all foreign hostages.In the name of the right to self-defence  recognised by the Charter of the United Nations for all Member States  Saudi Arabia is entitled to appeal to the international community to help it defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. It was in response to the appeal of that friendly country  with which Senegal has special relations  and in order to join the concert of nations in ensuring respect for law  that President Abdou Diouf decided to send a military contingent to that country. It is  moreover  comforting to see that this crisis seems to have strengthened the international community's determination to consolidate and strengthen the still fragile results achieved during these last months  which particularly concern two essential areas: the self-determination of peoples and the respect for and promotion of human rights throughout the world. Consolidating and strengthening these gains means also resolving the age-old conflicts that challenge the establishment of e. new political order which is able to promote peace and security throughout the world.For some conflicts  such as those in Western Sahara and Cambodia  encouraging progress has already been noted towards solutions sponsored by the United Nations. Senegal is honoured to have played a leading role in these two cases  thanks to the confidence regularly shown with regard to Senegal's chairing the United Nations Ad Ho  Committee on Kampuchea  and thanks to the initiative of its Head of State  President Abdou Diouf  who  in his capacity as the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) had initiated the process for negotiations on Western Sahara in co-operation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I should like to reaffirm that my country is prepared to continue to contribute in every way to the completion of the process under way.With regard to Cambodia  we welcome the agreement reached in Jakarta on 10 September 1990 to set up a Supreme national Council  and we hope that the parties to the conflict will take this historic opportunity to embark upon the road of national reconciliation.For other conflicts  such as the one in South Africa  we seem to be at the dawn of a new era  but the foundations of the apartheid system are still in place.The release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the removal of the ban on political movements including the African national Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania  the start of a dialogue with a view to dismantling apartheid: all these things  it is true  reflect a development that must be encouraged. However  the maintenance of repressive laws  the resort to divisiveness and its corollary  the escalation of violence  which are threats to the pursuit of political dialogue  require constant vigilance on the part of the international community  all countries must ensure that pressure continues to be brought to bear on the South African regime until this process  which has begun  is consolidated and grows in order to lead to the final eradication of the apartheid system.Senegal  which initiated the decision taken on 24 February by the Council of Ministers of the OAU to recommend to its member States that they commemorate 11 February of each year as Mandela Day  in recognition of the sacrifices made by this freedom fighter  reaffirms its constant commitment to working for the eradication of this crime against humanity.In the Korean peninsula  the process of peaceful reunification  which my country has always hoped for  seems to have registered son· progress with the recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of North Korea and South Korea. It is our hope that this meeting will b· followed up by further meetings so that the Korean peninsula nay finally be reunited. In that regard and with regard to the question of adequate representation for Korea in our Organisation  Senegal reaffirms its commitment to the principle of universality  in keeping with the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.These are conflicts for whose solution we see glimmers of hope  but  to our great regret  there are others that go on and on and get worse. It is so in the case of the question of Palestine  which continues to defy the conscience of the world. My country  which chairs the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  has already  with others  defined the principles that should underlie any draft solution  as well as the framework for a global settlement.Today  it is our most fervent wish that  in pursuance of the consensus that already exists with regard to the Gulf crisis  the Security Council will take the necessary measures to bring an end to the conflict in the Middle East through restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.With regard to Lebanon  where the situation gives rise to deep anguish  we make an urgent appeal that this battered and torn country be allowed to regain its unity without foreign interference.As for the Cyprus problem  we encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his effort  with a view to having a plan of action put in place in conformity with Security Council resolution 649 (1990).In connection with Afghanistan  there is now international consensus in favour of a negotiated solution. All efforts should therefore be directed towards the beginning of an internal process that would enable the Afghan people to exercise freely their right to self-determination.I should like to say a few words about two problems in our region - West Africa. First  there is the civil war that is raging in Liberia  which grieves us terribly. My country deplores this war. The suffering of our brothers  the people of Liberia  has gone on too long. Therefore it is urgent that there be convened a special summit of the Economic Community of west African States  at which all countries in the region would collectively seek a settlement that would permit this brother country to regain its unity and sovereignty  and enable its sons finally to become reconciled and to devote themselves to the rebuilding of its devastated economy. Senegal is working to this end  in the hope that  when the time comes  the international community will spare no effort to assist Liberia.With respect to our dispute with our neighbour Mauritania  Senegal  through me  reaffirms its determination to work tirelessly for an overall negotiated solution - a solution that would permit  among other things  removal of the obstacles that this unhappy conflict has put in the way of our pursuit of subregional integration. At the same time I repeat our full confidence and our availability with regard to the mediation committee that the Organisation of African Unity has established. This is the spirit that has always guided us in respect of the much-appreciated initiatives of friendly countries.An approach to the overall problem of international peace and security  if it is to be global  must take into account also equilibrium in the field of development. In this regard  President Abdou Diouf  in 1979  when he was Prime Minister  said:""Certainly we feel that all efforts to eliminate hotbeds of tension in the world  to silence guns and to stop fighting are praiseworthy. But we are convinced that even if - and this is something for which we hope deeply – the present conflicts were to end tomorrow  the world will still be on the verge of the abyss of war so long as the gap between rich and poor nations  far from diminishing  continues to grow  throwing into irreparable  Sisyphean despair so many people who have and laudable efforts to emerge from such a situation.”  Eleven years later  those words are still appropriate; never has the economic and social condition of two thirds of Mankind caused more disappointment or given rise to more anguished questions or more pessimistic projections. Despite the courageous corrective and restructuring Measures and the Measures for economic and financial and reorganisation that have been taken in recent years by the developing countries  the situation has been especially disturbing during the past decade. The instruments of economic analysis have shown everyone that when growth in the industrialised countries continues  per capita increase in Africa and Latin America drops considerably. Add to this the deep  and increasing  suffering of the developing countries at a time when new challenges are emerging  and these things are beyond the bounds of anything we have so far seen in the international community.But while that situation is of concern to any delegation  more disturbing is the low level of the results achieved from efforts at repair. The three United Nations development decades  which carried so many frustrated hopes  are evidence of this - if evidence were needed. We all know that these promises have not been kept  that expectations still have not been satisfied. At the same time the gap is widening between the developed countries and the developing countries where poverty is an offence to human dignity  and human beings  weakened by sickness and ignorance  and heroically struggling to survive and subsist in an often hostile environments. In this regard  one might recall that  for the first time in the history of mankind  an entire continent - Africa - has seen its living standards decreasing for more than 15 years  at a time when the world was at peace. The latest report on the economic situation in Africa  published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa  shows that between 1980 and 1089 per capita income dropped by 1.7 per cent per annual and commodity prices dropped by 3.1 per cent per annum  whereas unemployment grew four times faster than it had during the 1970s. In fact  many other indicators too show a deterioration  this is especially so in the case of total debt  which now amounts to more than $250 billion - an increase of 10 per cent per annum. In addition  the present crisis in the Gulf gives rise to the risk of a considerable increase in the energy bill of the non-oil-producing countries of Africa. It is time therefore  to translate into reality the many initiatives and actions already embarked upon to find an appropriate solution to the debt problem. In this respect the report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Bettino Craxi  recommends bold and laudable approaches.For its part Africa has already proposed engaging in serious  in-depth joint efforts to prepare as adequately as possible for the holding of an international conference on the external debt of African countries. This proposal  if it is followed up and carried out  could be a first step in the search for overall solutions to the question of the debt of the developing countries. Without any doubt the debt problem in the most serious teat of our determination to avoid the errors of the 1980s  of our willingness to make the 1990s a genuine development decade and of our ability to use the dividends of detente for the benefit of all humanity.More than ever the situation and economic prospects overall require careful consideration and joint action by all because  as the first Foreign Minister of Senegal said  ""The road to universal peace includes economic justice."" We must now come up with concrete positive acts. The lessening of tensions must be followed by a redistribution and redeployment of resources. For its part  having become aware that Africa must first count on itself  Africa seeks to find its own resources  creative potential and faculties  the means to meet the challenges of the 1990s  at the three levels of economic  social and political action. It is in this spirit that the Economic Community for Africa (ECA) at the United Nations proposed an African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes for Socio-economic Recovery and Transformation (AAFSAP). This is a specifically African step which simultaneously takes account of the different macro- and micro-economic parameters  the social dimension of structural adjustment and the long-tem objective· and strategies for development. The adoption of the draft treaty establishing the African Economic Community which is to be signed in Abeja  Nigeria  in January 1991  is also part of this dynamic process.None the less our actions would be incomplete and insufficient if they were not based on a will to combine our efforts in an economic integration likely to promote interregional exchanges end the complementarily of our economies. Indeed  we need to enhance our regional potential in order to foster the emergence of truly integrated economic groupings. That is why President Abdou Diouf established a ministerial department in charge of African integration and that is why Senegal is actively participating in the work of the so-called Group of 15 at the Summit on South-South Consultation and Co-operation.Furthermore  Senegal was delighted  as was the last Summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  at the international consensus"" which emerged at the Conference on Africa held in July 1990 at Maastricht in the Netherlands. That consensus in substance advocates ""sustained African efforts backed by an appropriate and constant external financing"" through a ""global coalition"". That should take into account the long-term nature of the African debt crisis and should regroup Africa  the World Bank and other traditional partners  in the framework of a new international partnership for the coming decade.The environment requires the reflection and diligent action of the entire community of nations. That is why we place great hopes in the conclusions of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Brazil in 1992  which should  Inter alia  recommend the mobilisation of adequate International assistance for the developing countries  especially those countries in Africa that are most affected by drought and desertification. Events of the recent months have demonstrated the importance of freedom of expression in the promotion of democracy we need in a world of peace and justice  for the establishment of a new political order batter able to help us resolve our disputes and to meet the challenges of all types with which we are all confronted. We must now give human rights problems their rightful place in international life. In this context my country would like to encourage the entire community of nations to make the World campaign for human rights launched by the United Nations a resounding success.  I should like to conclude by going back to my initial comments. The present evolution in international relations may be the harbinger of a new era in which our collective security can be guaranteed by the peaceful means of dialogue and of co-operation. But it could also be the harbinger of a new era of instability if selfishness not yield to generosity and if the new spirit of understanding and of co-operation among the major Powers of the world in not applied to alienate injustice  improve economic relations among nations and resolve the many challenges confronting mankind.These challenges can and must be met. They will be if dialogue  as the means of resolving international disputes  makes headway over confrontation. They will be if  freed from the old antagonisms of the cold war  our world allocates to the war on poverty  disease  ignorance  environmental deterioration  the enormous resources thus far devoted to producing the instruments of its own destruction.  It is in this way and is this way alone that we will be able to make of this last decade of the twentieth century a decade of freedom peace and progress.  "
"127",6175,"SGP",45,1990,"﻿Permit me to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. With your illustrious background and wide experience in affairs of state and government  you will guide the Assembly through its agenda with the skills and sensitivities required of the job. Singapore and Malta achieved independence in the same group of now States within a year of each other. We are thus particularly proud to see Malta in the Chair. I would also like to place on record our appreciation to His Excellency Major-General Joseph Garba for carrying out his duties as President of the General Assembly so efficiently and diligently during the last session.We take this opportunity to welcome independent Namibia to the General Assembly as a member of the United Nations for the first time. Its presence has been long stalled and we are most happy to see Namibia finally take the seat in our Midst. We also welcome our newest member  Liechtenstein  which played an active role in many Multilateral bodies even when it was not formally a Member of the Organisation.There is no doubt that the United Nations gains strength as its membership gains universality. We WELCOME the interest shown by the Republic of Korea in joining the United Nations. We would also welcome the Democratic People's Republic of Korea if it wishes to join. Membership for the two Koreas in the United Nations need not preclude their efforts for peaceful reunification.Momentous changes are transforming the world. Historians have pronounced that the post-war era and the structure of world politics which it engendered collapsed in 1989. We witnessed breathtaking events in Eastern Europe as existing political orders gave way to new ones  culminating in the breach of the Berlin Wall on 9 November. Today  on 3 October  we see the two Germanys united as one. History will no doubt recognize and record that it was President Mikhail Gorbachev's courage and determination to initiate change in the Soviet Onion and his now thinking that transformed the historical context in which we now live and act. Super-Power rivalry and the balancing of military power and blocs have been replaced by super-Power dialogue and co-operation. In many parts of the world this has meant the easing of tensions and a greater latitude in relationships.The cold war is over. But it is not the end of history. History will go on and it will not be boring. If we are not careful  it might even be devastating. The end of the ideological cold war only reveals the vast dimensions of the problems still confronting us.Notwithstanding the auspicious climate between the East and the Host  the problems of the threats to international peace and security and the maintenance of peace and security are as pressing and as relevant as ever. Not since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 have we been faced with an international crisis of such grave proportions. In August  we were on the verge of a military catastrophe. As the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  said recently in Bogota  on 23 August  the third world countries ""continue to experience alarming insecurity  of which we are now seeing dreadful evidence"".With hindsight we can see that the euphoria ushered in by the end of the cold war could not have lasted. Even as we witnessed the peaceful political changes in Europe and a successful transition to independence in Namibia we were made acutely aware of the elusiveness of global peace. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan did not hasten the achievement of a political settlement and the fighting and killing persisted. The situation in Lebanon continued to worsen and the peace process on the question of Palestine moved at a glacial pace. Thus the learned that détente between the super-Powers need not automatically mean a more congenial environment globally. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is a grim reminder of the problem of security for smaller States in a Hobbsian world. In a matter of hours  the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait was complete.At the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly my delegation drew attention to the paradox of peace for the weaker and smaller nations. If the structure of world politics has changed irrevocably with the breathtaking eradication of the deep ideological divide  a new order is waiting to be constructed. There are undoubtedly many new players that can affect the restructuring of the international order. There is little doubt that the retreat of the super-Powers from their global role creates an opening wedge for the development of regional ambitions and encourages new aspirants to regional hegemony. This was what Iraq set out to do by force. This is what the international community must seek strenuously to prevent.The Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait is absolutely unacceptable because it was unprovoked. It was an act of blatant aggression. It was against the principles and the Charter of the United Nations. Kuwait has been a peace-loving and law-abiding member of the international community. Furthermore  it enjoyed good relations with its neighbour  Iraq. Yet on 2 August thousands of Iraqi troops backed by tanks and helicopters overran Kuwait City  taking the capital. The Security Council reacted swiftly and decisively and it voted unanimously to condemn the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait. It reacted correctly when it expressed its determination not to recognize any regime set up by the occupying Power.This was what the United Nations was created for - to maintain international peace and security and to take collective measures to prevent and remove threats to the peace and to suppress acts of aggression. For the first time in the history of the United Nations the Security Council imposed comprehensive sanctions backed by a naval and air blockade to put pressure on Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait and to restore sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity to the country. In the new post-cold-war era the United Nations rose to meet the threat and the challenge. There is no other way. The United Nations must stand united in its resolve to get Iraq out of Kuwait. Iraq must see that the whole world is against its actions  and not just a few countries.The international community must not shrink from its duty to take concerted action against aggressors who violate international law and principles. Otherwise  nations would exist in a state of permanent insecurity. It is also a tact that third world nations depend to an extraordinary degree on international bodies for the preservation of security. There should be more effective ways to prevent aggression. We should not wait till the belligerent strikes.Singapore views the annexation of Kuwait most gravely. This is especially so as one historic epoch is closing and another is unfolding. For about 40 years we established an international order where the rules of the game were understood. The super-Powers played a role in upholding that order. Today  in the fluid international situation  new players are testing the system. We must not lose the opportunity to insist now that the new international order should be one which demands the strictest adherence to the norms and the principles of international law backed by an effective system of common and collective security. If history since the Second World War has taught us anything  we should have come to the recognition that military power cannot be used to achieve political objectives and that aggression does not pay. It is the task of the United Nations to underscore this message with the weight of its collective will to deter future aggressors. In South-East Asia the United Nations played a crucial role in an analogous problem of peace and security. After more than a decade of war it is now possible to envisage realistically an end to the long tragedy of Cambodia.On 10 September 1990 a major breakthrough was achieved in Jakarta  when all the Cambodian parties agreed to accept  in its entirety  the framework for a comprehensive political settlement based on an enhanced United Nations role in Cambodia that was worked out by the five permanent members of the Security Council during the course of this year. In Jakarta  the Cambodians also formed a Supreme National Council which now occupies Cambodia's seat in this Assembly. This is the first critical stage towards a more far-reaching national reconciliation. Many years of patient work by countries in and outside the region contributed to this success. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has played a leading role on Cambodia from the very beginning. An International Conference on Kampuchea was held at the United Nations in 1981 under the chairmanship of the Foreign Minister of Austria. The Ad Hoc Committee of that Conference  led by Senegal  has played a useful role. Indonesia took the initiative to organize a series of informal meetings in Jakarta. France and Indonesia convened an International Conference on Cambodia in Paris last August which established the basic framework for the negotiating process.The Permanent Five must be commended for having had the vision and the courage to seize the historic opportunity afforded by the profound international realignments that have occurred  to work together to shape the framework of a settlement. The recent adoption of Council resolution 668 (1990) by a unanimous vote of the Council is a watershed in the Cambodian peace process.But in the most basic and important sense  a political settlement in Cambodia will be the achievement of the international community as a whole; a success for all States  big and small  in and outside the region. It is only because the international community  expressing its will in successive sessions of the General Assembly during the last decade  refused to compromise on basic principles of international law that it is possible to look forward to the restoration of Cambodian independence and peace throughout South-East Asia. Z should like to tasks this opportunity to thank all those who have steadfastly supported ASEAN for more than a decade. It was their faith in the United Nations and in international law that made the achievements of Jakarta  Paris and the Permanent Five possible. The Permanent Five framework accepted by the Cambodians in Jakarta is not a perfect document. We are dealing with political realities that are far from perfect. There are still many challenges ahead. But it is the best hope for the majority of ordinary Cambodians who have no interest in the machinations and rivalries of their leaders and their patrons and whose only desire is peace. For these many ordinary Cambodians  the United Nations offers their only hope for a better life for themselves and their children. We must not falter or fail them. If much has been achieved  much more needs to be done. Peace in Cambodia will require an enhanced role for the United Nations that is without precedent. The framework accepted by the Cambodian parties needs to be fleshed out and elaborated in many details.There should be no illusions that this will be an easy task. But the foundations have been laid. I am confident that if the major Powers and the regional Powers continue to co-operate  and the Cambodians themselves build upon the opportunity now before them  it is a task that is well within our grasp. The urgent need now is to maintain the momentum and press ahead  setting aside old animosities  working only for the good of all Cambodians  without being distracted by recriminations or irrelevant rivalries. We hope that all parties will co-operate fully in the process of elaborating the framework  without raising new issues or reviving questions that have been overtaken by events. Attempts to alter the Permanent Five framework will only prolong conflict. We look forward to the early reconvening of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia  where a final comprehensive political settlement can be signed.When this occurs it will turn the page on an unhappy period in the history of Cambodia  Indo-China and South-East Asia. It will signal the beginning of a new chapter in which the animosities of the past can be set aside in favour of co-operation for mutual benefit. The peoples of Indo-China have suffered deprivation for too long. They deserve better. Κ Cambodia at peace with itself and with its neighbours and a vibrant and dynamic Viet Ham  at peace with the region and sharing fully in the prosperity of the rest of South-East Asia  is in the interests of all the ASEAN countries  and indeed of the world. This will be a triumph for the international community and for the United Nations.All this leads us to conclude that the United Nation is poised to play an increasingly significant role  to foster and uphold a now international order; an international order which is peaceful; an international order which is just; an international order which is equal; an international order which will not tolerate larger States devouring smaller States; and an international order in which gross imbalances between nations will be reduced.My delegation is pleased that co-operation between the great Powers has facilitated the work of the United Nations  allowing it to respond in a crisis with requisite speed. But we would be concerned if great-Power unanimity translated into a great-Power directorate which would in effect shape the new international order without the necessary checks and balances. If we are to leave behind the old international order to reach out for a new order in a new era  where domination and aggression are phenomena of the past  then the voices of the many  the voices of the North and the South  the great and the small  should be heard and heeded. The United Nations  which is a microcosm of the macrocosm  is a useful forum through which the great Powers must consult the rest of the world to forge a consensus on peace and development.The United Nations in the new era will be stretched to perform additional functions as its potential is now fully appreciated by all. Some of those functions will be new; they will be innovative activities demanded by a rapidly changing world that is impatient to enjoy the promise of economic modernization and political change. There will be catalytic actions demanded for tackling the problems of the global environment  debt  terrorism  drugs and AIDS. The United Nations is best placed to co-ordinate the efforts and provide the mechanisms necessary to tackle urgent environmental issues  which are complex  multifaceted and related to issues of development. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will require follow>up action to achieve the targets of the twenty-first-century agenda. The United Nations will thus surely grow. Other functions will be those that were envisaged under the Charter by the founding fathers but were never implemented because ideological differences and mistrust got in the way.Certainly the time has come in the interests of international peace for the United Nations to sharpen its ability to deter or counter aggression by one State against another. The monitoring and decision-making mechanisms of the United Nations  as well as the machinery of collective defence  should be increasingly geared towards a policy of ""prevention is better than cure"".The United Nations has now come full circle. There was a time when its detractors were abundant and its prestige was low. Today  after a string of successes with the Iran-Iraq war  Afghanistan  Namibia and Cambodia  we have new faith in the institution. But the effectiveness of the United Nations cannot be based simply on respect and faith or even on political support. In the end the potential of the United Nations will be determined by the financial solvency of the institution. If we are to help the United Nations realise its potential it is important that all its Members should pay their assessed contributions in full. Just as it is important to uphold the Charter in natters of international law and principles  so it is equally important to abide by its rules on financial arrangements.	The United Nations may never fulfil the Utopian dream of its founders  but it can stake new beginnings in the 1990s  if all of us want that to happen."
"128",6208,"SLB",45,1990,"﻿May I  or behalf of my Government and the people of Solomon Islands  congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the forty-fifth session of the United Nations  General Assembly. It is my conviction that with your fine diplomatic skills and wealth of experience  the current session will be further enhanced by the successful and practical results we would all want.I also wish to express my profound gratitude to your predecessor Major General Joseph H. Garba of Nigeria  for his excellent leadership during the last session.I wish to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts and his dedication towards realising and upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations.On 12 October last year my Foreign Minister  Sir Baddeley Devesi  stood on this famous rostrum to voice - perhaps one could now say with hindsight - a somewhat over-zealous expression of optimism and trust in humankind and in the ability of the United Nations to influence man's desire for peace.But world events today  as exemplified by the crisis in the Middle East  bear sad witness to the flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. It has driven home to me and to my country  Solomon Islands  the frailty of man  his insatiable hunger for power  his oftentimes misplaced fervour and the temptation to dominate others outside the bounds of reason and rationality. It is even more disappointing and sad to know that while in the Gulf region last year the prospects for peace became visible with the United Nations-monitored cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  this year the ""serpent's head"" has emerged up once again in the same area of the world.Notwithstanding that  we will not apologise for our optimism in the search for peace. What was said in this Assembly last year by Solomon Islands was said in good faith and still stands true today  namely that we must give peace a chance and not merely talk or preach about it. We believe we should not resign ourselves to accepting peace as an illusion to be couched in terms of what the great English and world statesman  Winston Churchill  would term a human tragedy.My country  Solomon Islands  is a peaceful island nation. Peace is the only gift we can offer and contribute to this international body  the United Nations. We do not believe in guns or bullets  and so within the limits of our ability as a Christian nation  pray God  we have no enemies.It is in this spirit of great concern for world peace that in a note verbale dated 10 August 1990 we immediately replied to the Security Council's call  through the Secretary-General  giving the Solomon Islands Government's assurances of its support for Security Council resolution 661 (1990) adopted on 6 August 1990  and the Government's commitment to implement the resolution to the limits of its ability as a comparatively small nation  and in concert with the aims of the Charter and the ideals and purposes of the United Nations.Having said all that  and in consideration of peace in the global contest  it is probably correct to say that no two countries can have the same perception of peace now in this ""Modern world. Certainly  that would be true between a country with a highly developed technology and arsenals capacity  such as  for example  the United States  and a small developing country like the Solomon Islands with a simple village-life orientation.Peace to a super-Power would not be too meaningful without the acceptance and assurance of military strength; whereas in the Solomon Islands we would regard the manufacture and stockpiling of modern weapons of war as inviting war itself. Unfortunately  the reality of our world today would tend to draw smaller countries like the Solomon Islands into conflicts that we do not really care for in the first place  and which we know we cannot aspect to influence in any effective manner outside of our humble attempts to contribute to peace and love in the practice of sharing and caring for the needs of others.Of course  the scenario in other countries such as those of the Middle East with long historical backgrounds of warfare and with their endowments of rich oil deposits  which would enable them financially to arm themselves  would be entirely different. The only common denominator for achieving harmony in the world is peace and love  which is the only weapon Solomon Islands knows and believes in.With the present turmoil in the Middle East it could be a good thing for the world to take stock and to learn a few lessons. I venture to suggest three: first  man is a creature vulnerable to the misuse of power at any given time so we must all be alert to manifestations of this kind and help prevent such situations from arising; secondly  the super-Powers of the world henceforth cease selling destructive weapons  both nuclear and conventional  to other countries  big or snail  rich or poor  that do not yet possess then; and thirdly  the United Nations must seize the opportunity to take responsibility for world peace and not lot individual countries believe that they can take unilateral decisions over military action in the world.Only in times of peace can nations think rationally about their own needs  and about the assistance the one can give to the other. Only in peace-time can balanced judgements for aid assistance to developing countries by the more developed countries be made.In the present climate of world tension all the noble thoughts of sharing and hearing for one another have given way to amassing troops and weapons of war and round-the-globe visits in the name of diplomacy. The most powerful country in the world is now seeking financial aid from ""friends"" to contain the coats of an exercise which threatens world peace. It is ironic to so many that money became  available sore readily in time of war than in times of peace.There are  however  hopeful developments the threat of war in the Middle East has brought the two super-Powers together and in Asia the two Koreas are moving in an unprecedented way towards reunification after 40 long years. The Cambodian factions have decided to talk with the blessing of the Soviet Union and China  while Iran and Iraq have exchanged prisoners of war. These are indeed encouraging signs for peace in the future  but we need not go to war or be threatened by the prospect of war to achieve harmonious international relations.In the mean time my country  Solomon Islands  and its Pacific neighbours remain relatively peaceful. Pray God this will always be so. However  we do not wish to see our priorities  our important needs and what we value most in life - sovereignty and independence  the right to self-determination  a wholesome sea resource and no nuclear contamination of the sources of our livelihood - relegated to the back seat  pushed into the background and neglected by the world community because of a conflict and instability we had no hand in bringing about.We are delighted that Japan  a leading member of our Pacific Community  has listened to our request and has taken the lead in banning drift-net fishing a year before the date set by a United Nations resolution. We have the highest regard for and a strong belief in the goodness of man and we therefore believe that Taiwan and Korea will soon follow suit.We are moreover encouraged to hear of Japan's commitment to world peace and stability as expounded in this Assembly on 25 September 1990 by Mr. Taro Nakayana  the Foreign Minister of Japan. Japan  we have learned  in line with its Peace Constitution  is ""firmly resolved not to become a military Power that could pose a threat to other nations of the world"". (A 45 PV.7. p.26iAs a small nation in the Asia-Pacific region  Solomon Islands welcomes such a genuine commitment most sincerely.Yet another welcome statement for today's world  with the background of the Middle East crisis  in the view of Solomon Islands was that delivered by Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze  Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  also on 25 September 1990. It illuminates with common sense the abhorrence of the spread and proliferation of nuclear  chemical  bacteriological and missile weapons  which would destroy mankind and our world.As recently as last Monday  from this very rostrum  the President of the United States of America  Mr. George Bush  expressed his yearning and desire that his great country rid this world of all these diabolical weapons of war. Solomon Islands wishes to commend such admirable leadership and would remind members of the fact that these commitments are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.May I at this juncture explain that besides representing my country  Solomon Islands  I shall now speak briefly also as current Chairman of the Melanesian sub-group known as the Melanesian Spearhead Group of the South Pacific forum.We applaud the efforts of independent organisations such as the Green peace Group and we praise our own South Pacific Forum for the fight they are leading to maintain a healthy environment in our region. We cannot understand why the United States and France especially - the two countries that have stood up traditionally as champions of freedom and that we regard as friends from our colonial past - cannot lend their ears to our genuine pleas to stop polluting the seas from which we draw our livelihood and sustenance. They continue to dump wastes and test their nuclear bombs in our fishing grounds. Yet we ourselves continue to love and respect them without restraint. We give them our votes and our support at various international forums  especially here at the United Nations and its various other organs.With all due respect to the great country of France  which over the last 10 to 20 years has assured us that the Mururoa tests are safe and would not leak radiation for thousands of years to come  we have just learned with dismay from an American scientist that radioactive leaks have in fact taken place at Mururoa and that we can expect snore leaks six years after every bomb is exploded by France.France's indomitable love for the freedom of mankind led it  on 8 October 1886  to present to the people of the United States  and indeed the world  that unique reminder of the spirit of freedom - the wonderful Statue of Liberty  whose existence and beauty none of us in this honourable Assembly can deny.When can we expect France to send a replica of that torch of freedom to shine over New Caledonia and its indigenous people and the peoples of the South Pacific?The indigenous people of Tahiti  the Te Aho Maohi whose territory has been occupied by France since 1842  nuclear bombs tested on its land and its seas polluted - has been waiting patiently in the wings  anxious to be re-inscribed on the agenda of the United Nations Special Committee on the Implementation of the Declaration on Decolonisation with the aim of gaining independence and becoming a member of this community of nations in its own right. In 1946 President Charles de Gaulle unilaterally withdrew Tahiti  together with Mew Caledonia  from the list of non-self-governing nations. I believe that there is now a new drive by the local indigenous people of the ""Te Aho Maohi"" to be re-inscribed on the list of the Committee of 24  now that New Caledonia was successfully re-inscribed on 2 December 1986.Solomon Islands is pleased to have been one of the first countries to request on 10 October 1984 in the Assembly  the re-inscription of our Melanesian brothers of New Caledonia  and today we ask once again that our Polynesian brothers of Tahiti be favoured in the same manner by this world body  which believes in the legitimate freedom of man and of nations to look after their own affairs.There can be no marking time any more. The United Nations  especially at this time  has shown and committed itself to act for what is right and against what is wrong in the world  and we are obligated by our Charter to stand up for the importance of the universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination and of the speedy granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples for the effective guarantee and observance of human rights.No other indigenous island people of the South Pacific in modern times has shed so much blood in the cause of freedom and independence as the natives of New Caledonia  and all they have so far received from France with respect to freedom and self-respect is the Matignon Accord which does not guarantee them independence.May I conclude by humbly appealing to each and every one in this Assembly to look to the future with a new vision of peace and true equality of purpose. We are at the threshold of what we have been referring to lately as a new world order  with changing patterns of friendships and relationships between countries and peoples. Let us begin with love and respect for each other as individuals and fellow human beings with the right to live peacefully in this world. Only then shall we see the light ahead and give peace a chance. "
"129",6254,"SLE",45,1990,"﻿It is a privilege for me to be participating once again in the work of the General Assembly  and it gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  the congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. This is a well-deserved recognition of your many qualities as a national and international statesman. I should like also to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Garba  for the exemplary and commendable manner in which he guided the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth regular session and also the three special sessions devoted to apartheid  illicit narcotic drugs and international economic co-operation. To him we express our appreciation.We once again pay tribute to the United Nations  and in particular we commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts in the pursuit and achievement of peace in many troubled parts of the world. We congratulate him on his recent successes  particularly for his role in the smooth transition of Namibia to independence.The admission of new Members to the United Nations is always a major achievement  for it brings the universality of the Organisation - a primary objective of the Charter - even closer. With the membership of the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Republic of Namibia  the primacy of the United Nations as a force in international relations is once more reinforced. We welcome them among us end look forward to their contribution in addressing the important tasks that lie ahead.Namibia's independence does not  however  close its difficult history  for decades of pillaging have left that country's economy in desperate need of assistance. We are hopeful that such assistance will be forthcoming to ensure that the fruits of independence and sovereignty are not in any way compromised by economic instability. This is the continuing obligation which the international community must now discharge. The winds of change which started in Eastern Europe a year ago culminated on 3 October with the reunification of the German States. The crumbling of the Berlin Hall and the act of reunification have effectively pulled down the iron curtain that was the dominant political factor of post-war Europe. Sierra Leone welcomes this momentous occasion  which is indeed the culmination of the historic desire and the untiring efforts of the German people themselves to reunite their homeland. Like many of the events of 1989 in Europe  German reunification symbolises the triumph of the human spirit over artificial  and sometimes evil  forces that negate its full expression. Germany in the future will  we believe  be a force for stability and progress in a world much of which has been ravaged by conflict  poverty  disease  neglect and prejudice.This development opens new horizons for understanding and co-operation among nations and reaffirms the belief of my delegation that Korea  like the two Germanys and the two Yemens  can seek membership of this Organisation without prejudice to the desire of its people for the reunification of its homeland. Sierra Leone therefore expresses its support for the desire of the Republic of Korea for membership of the United Nations. We commend the efforts of the two Governments and  in particular  the recent meeting of the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea - an event which is bound to lead to a lessening of tensions between the two countries.As the frontiers of political change are broadened  so are we hopeful that before long apartheid South Africa will itself experience this metamorphosis. The Sierra Leone delegation continues to observe closely developments in that country following the release of the Vice-President of the African National Congress of South Africa (AHC)  Mr. Nelson Mandela  with the hope that the tread will be allowed to gather its natural momentum. The dialogue between black organisations and the South African government should be actively encouraged so that positive results can be realised. Situations that threaten this prospect should be avoided. The ongoing violence in the townships raises alarming fears - fears that the sinister agency behind this murderous upsurge has napped out an agenda which  by creating rarest and fanning the flames of rivalries  is committed to mortgaging South Africa's peaceful and democratic future to a retention of the present untenable status quo. It requires no exceptional premonition to discern that the greater good of all South Africans cannot be assured in an atmosphere that pits brother against brother. President F.N. de Klerk has shown tremendous foresight  sincerity and courage  and now he has the opportunity of demonstrating his commitment to irreversible political change by firmly arresting the violence and restoring law and order.With respect to the situation in Western Sahara  my delegation has consistently supported the joint efforts of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to secure a resolution of the conflict by ensuring the full exercise by the people of their right to self-determination. As the Secretary-General observes  it is now necessary to guarantee the success of these modalities  already agreed upon  in order to provide for an early referendum in the territory. He hope that  in keeping with the plan already approved by the Security Council  the parties to the conflict will continue to be amenable to the measures that have been taken in this direction.The tragic situation in the Republic of Liberia must attract the attention of the international community. The Foreign Minister of the Republic of the Gambia has already given a detailed account of the tragedy which gave rise to an initiative by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to put an end to the carnage and destruction in that country. This plan  in my delegation's view  offers the best hope for peace and stability in Liberia and deserves the support of all peace-loving States.The key elements of the plan address the fundamental issues  namely  the establishment of a cease-fire  monitoring of the cease-fire  setting up of an interim administration and the conduct of free and fair elections to be monitored by international observers. The plan also stipulates that whoever heads the interim administration cannot be a candidate for the presidency.These proposals have been accepted at a conference of political parties and interest groups which was convened in the Republic of the Gambia. The suffering and misery of the Liberian people engendered by this conflict has few parallels in modern African history. The displacement of whole families  and even whole communities  in a once peaceful and stable nation has created a massive refugee problem that has imposed tremendous stresses on the economies of neighbouring countries. Much of this may be unknown to the international community and  consequently  lost on the conscience of many. It is for this reason  and many more  that we commend the ECOWAS plan for support by this Organisation.As the world continues to be energised by the exciting politics of change  the quest for a durable solution of the question of Palestine becomes imperative. The lessening of tension in that region has now acquired an urgency  within the context of a Palestinian homeland and mutual security assurance for all States.The international conference on the Middle East should be convened to consider problems pertaining to the region and  in particular  the solution to the Palestinian question.The situation which has been brought about in the Persian Gulf as a consequence of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is both dangerous and unfortunate - dangerous  because it now threatens to plunge that region once again into a conflict of major dimensions  and unfortunate in its cold-war contest. For Iraq's aggression is at variance with the Charter's provisions and the freshening wind of political change sweeping across the world. It threatens to pull us back into the abyss of tension and militarism from which we are so slowly emerging. My Government has publicly declared its condemnation of Iraq's action and called for its immediate withdrawal from Kuwaiti territory. We do so again from this podium. Our support for the Security Council's handling of this crisis remains firm  as does our conviction that the purported annexation of Kuwait should not be allowed to succeed.The inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force is still a fundamental corner-stone of international law and respect for it becomes even more compelling in the evolving climate of mutual understanding and accommodation in which we all have a stake. The Sierra Leone delegation believes that a peaceful resolution of the present situation is still within reach  and that bringing this about should remain the task of the United Nations. However  whatever the coming weeks may bring  the resolve of the international community should be steadfast and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity is an objective from which we cannot deviate.The Secretary-General observes in his report that the problem of Cyprus has not shown any movement in the negotiating process as was anticipated last year  while the situation on the island continues to deteriorate. Over the years  my Government has stressed the necessity for both Cypriot communities to approach all the issues with frankness and determination for compromise. Though the road to reconciliation may be rocky  it is the only one that can be taken. Rebuilding confidence and trust is important in this journey which  we hope  will eventually lead to a comprehensive solution. The recent World Summit for Children deserves some comment  inter alia  for its remarkable organisational success and for its substantive achievement. It underlines the fact that the world is now truly a global village where rapid and enduring solutions to problems require the widest possible consensus and commitment at the highest political level.The President of the Republic of Sierra Leone  His Excellency Major-General Joseph Saidu Momoh  participated at this Summit to demonstrate his profound interest in the development and welfare of children and to underline his commitment to the idea of collective international action. Over the past five years. Sierra Leone  for its part  has embarked on a bold and decisive campaign to reduce infant mortality. The percentage of fully immunized children has risen from 6 per cent in 1986 to 24 per cent in 1988 and to 66 per cent in 1990. Our national objective is to achieve universal child immunization by the end of this year.In the Declaration and Plan of Action they adopted  the Summit leaders essentially acknowledged that the plight of the world's children is largely a reflection of more fundamental global economic and social problems. They recognized that in order to ensure the protection  survival and development of children everywhere  it is necessary to address such issues as the abuse of the environment  the international debt and the enduring economic difficulties experienced by many developing countries.This is a significant step towards global mobilization against the most pernicious of all problems - the problem of economic underdevelopment. We have reason to hope that  along with progress in disarmament and arms control  the defusing of the cold war will now make it possible to overcome the philosophical and ideological differences that hitherto impeded divisive international action in this area. Each year  the agenda of the United Nations has been strong on problems pertaining to economic development  conflict resolution and the advancement of social issues for the improvement of the human condition. Each nation  great and small  has a responsibility for mobilising the global consciousness necessary for the success of the United Nations.For many of the countries of the third world  deep in the morass of conflict and poverty  the journey from a rural agrarian environment to a highly literate industrialised society may span many generations. And although it is a journey that is slowly being made by many nations today  it cannot be fully achieved without the sensitivity and assistance of the advanced countries of the North.We shall continue to make a solemn appeal for all nations  rich and poor  strong and weak  to join in peace and harmony on this journey. This appeal is also being made in full realisation of the divine purpose of our creation and the undeniable fact that no man and no nation can completely fulfil its mandate on Earth without an underlying substratum of the eternal."
"130",6301,"SLV",45,1990,"﻿I wish to begin my address to the Assembly  Sir  by saying how pleased I am at your election to preside  with your usual skill and wisdom  over the difficult work of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  the highest forum at which the world's problems are discussed. In congratulating you  we also wish to express our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  for his work during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly; this makes it clear that the Organisation - to which we are so proud to belong and to which we feel such a sense of commitment - is continuing its consistent efforts to the benefit of the higher interests of the international community. We also wish to make special mention of the significant and important role played by the Secretary-General at this crucial tint· in history  when more than ever before  the function of diplomatic understanding requires the contribution of experienced men of vision. Zn particular  as far as BÍ Salvador is concerned  we wish to express our sincere and profound gratitude to the Secretary-General for his efforts and those of his personal representative  Dr. Alvaro de Sote  to find a political solution to the Salvadoran conflict  which for over a decade has inflicted tremendous suffering on the people of my country.This is the second time I have spoken from this rostrum from which the representatives of all the peoples of the world make their voices heard. I must candidly say that I have been greatly struck by the extraordinary magnitude and pace of the changes that have occurred in the world in the last year. The transformation now occurring in the consciousness of humanity is so significant and so far reaching in its implications that I would even go so far as to say that it is an unprecedented development in the history of the last few centuries. I wish to emphasise that it is a phenomenon of consciousness that is in question  because it seems beyond any doubt that what we are seeing is not merely a change of ideologies but the emergence of a much more dynamic and broader conception of liberty in the political  economic and cultural spheres.After a traumatic century in which virtually the entire intelligentsia of the world allowed itself to be seduced by the mirage of radicalism  sacrificing freedom on the altar of equality  the totalitarian utopia bas collapsed  leaving it quite evident that no equality and no progress have been achieved and showing that freedom  despite all the chains  is a fundamental and invariable force. The most exemplary and beautiful phenomenon we have noted in recent months is that freedom eventually prevails over any ideology that tries to adulterate or destroy it  and the individual will survives even the most sophisticated collectivist aberrations. That is true mot only for the industrialised world  but also for the developing world. Freedom is not the exclusive privilege of anyone  nor is democracy anyone's exclusive patrimony. All humans have the right and ability to be free. All peoples have the capacity to live and to develop in democracy. In the new era of human history that we are now entering  there is no longer any room for paralysing authoritarianism or destructive totalitarianism. The change that is taking place in history belongs to all of us and commits all of us.Fortunately  the simplistic catch-phrases of ideology have lost all their spurious magic. What is now prevailing is a healthy pragmatism that will make it possible to restructure the systems of ideas in a healthier way more in keeping with the dynamism of the creative spirit of humanity. The dreadful wars and bloody revolutions hove taught us a lesson that is as old as history itself but more valid and more vigorous than even violence and hatred cause only destruction  because they are the greatest enemies of life.As those responsible for the conduct of the affairs of our nations  we are meeting here precisely to work for life. The renewed interest in the protection of children is evidence of that. The widespread determination to save and protect the natural environment is also evidence of it. The universal repudiation of all forms of war and aggression testify to that end. The powerful re-emergence of the methods of peace to confront even the most difficult problems of our age demonstrates this point in a practically unanimous manner.The unanimity of the civilized world in response to the crisis in the Persian Gulf is the best sign that the world requirement of security for peace is being strengthened much more rapidly than the most optimistic forecasts could have estimated. It is vitally important that we should avoid war through all diplomatic and political means available. The international machinery is being put to the test and our Organization now has a very crucial challenge facing it. If the civilised methods prove able to resolve the crisis brought about by the repugnant and offensive act of aggression against the sovereign State of Kuwait the international order will have emerged unscathed from the supreme ordeal. If not  it will be more than ever evident that a new international security order is required and that all international machinery needs to be revised. Cur Government resolutely supports the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the crisis and fervently appeals for the effective implementation without delay of those and any other resolutions that may be necessary to resolve a crisis that so seriously jeopardises world peace and development.In this phase of contemporary history our terrible and yet so promising Central America has gradually emerged as s concrete reality in the eyes of the international community. One can safely argue that before the 1980s Central America was practically an unknown area from which only sporadic news emerged and always with an exotic overtone. In the middle of a world that is rapidly being modernised Central America seemed doomed to irretrievable historical ostracism such that it was not considered worthy of involvement in the future of civilisation. The profound political crisis of the traditional institutions  together with the major effort made by totalitarianism to seize the region - which was strategically so important in the patterns of the cold war - caused Central America to make a leap into the void. It found itself propelled from endemic anonymity to the forefront of the agenda of the world Powers and onto the headlines of the world press.The last great confrontation of the cold war occurred in Central America. Central America was the last act of the drama on which we now see the final curtain coming down. And that result of gainful conflict whose effects we are trying to overcome at the national and regional levels has also given us an international dimension that we must now put to good use in order to establish peace and consolidate our democratic processes.Contrary to all adversity and expectations  democracy is now a functioning reality in all the countries of Central America. But we cannot and must not lose sight of the fact that nascent democracies are fragile and depend to a considerable extent on international understanding and support. From this rostrum  I reiterate our request to the international community for resolute  concrete and substantial support for the Central American democracies and for Salvadoran democracy in particular.We also realise that our democracies cannot request support without at the same time earning the world's credibility. Two factors are essential in that regard. We must show that we Central Americans are actually engaged in a serious process of integration amongst ourselves for peace and development. We must also show in tangible terms that each of our societies is working courageously for democratic institutional reform and the full guarantee of human rights.We also reiterate a cordial and respectful plea to our friends  the Presidents of Central America  including Panama  for us to rise even more resolutely and energetically in the near future to meet the challenge of integration  not just economic but also social and political integration.It is not my intention to repeat the advocacy of union  as was characteristic of the past. Bather  I seek to form the outlines as soon as possible of a Central America of nationalities  which will make it possible to preserve our individual characteristics and at the same time come to terms with the reality of a world that does not forgive isolation or acknowledge self-sufficiency.If great blocks of nations can unite in a new type of nationality whose prime component is a common destiny  it would be absurd for us Central Americans to fail to find suitable formulas to confront in a united way the challenge of modernity  which is increasingly complex and competitive. The world already tends to see Central America as a block  and Central American cannot shirk that vision of itself from the outside world without running the severe risk of retaining a marginal status in history. Our priority task is to achieve general peace in Central America  which will make possible permanent democratic stability. In reference to peace  the case of El Salvador cones to mind first and foremost.Speaking about El Salvador from this rostrum of the United Nations provides an extraordinary opportunity as always and allows us to reiterate with truth and sincerity our commitment to what we Salvadorians are doing to change our society in order to make it more prosperous and more united in the immediate future. In that regard peace is now the top priority for our Government in accordance with the most profound and urgent aspiration of the national community and with the expressed sentiments of the international community.I take this opportunity to refer to peace in El Salvador as something quite concrete and feasible which is important to all of us and incumbent upon all of us. We must exclude no one from this peace effort unless we are to commit the same error as in the past that is leaving certain sectors out of the construction of our national destiny or in a marginal status.As I have insistently stated since assuming the presidency I regard myself as the legitimate representative and servant of the interests of all Salvadorians even those who do not share my pattern of values and my views concerning the country. We Salvadorians are learning - and our apprenticeship is difficult and arduous but necessary - that in order to deserve to live in peace must work seriously for tolerance and mutual respect beyond ideologies and sectoral interests. Our country is historically moving in that direction as are our daily efforts. In this respect we attach great importance to the role of the political parties regardless of ideology and turn proud to inform the international community that there is now in El Salvador inter-party machinery which has come about in the climate of negotiations now prevailing in the country and in which all the political parties  of various schools of thought  are working together.This inter-party effort  which has never been so broad or self-sustained in the history of our country  has already borne its first fruits a consensus agreement to carry out reforms and take the necessary measures to guarantee that the legislative and municipal elections of next March will be to the fullest extent possible secure and clean and have massive voter participation  so that no one can objectively call them in question.For this purpose  the inter-party commi8aion has agreed to international monitoring of the electoral process from its initial stages. My Government  with its firm commitment to endorsing the consensus agreements resulting from the elections  expresses before this universal forum its determination to ensure that the international monitoring of the forthcoming elections will begin functioning immediately with sufficient scope and freedom to leave no doubt in anyone's mind of our will to achieve democracy.In the light of the foregoing  we invite the Organization and its Member States to give us their full co-operation and to set in motion immediately  in a consistent and effective manner  the machinery for international monitoring of the forthcoming electoral process. In our country clean and honest elections are an important part of the democratization that has been under way since 1982.Peace in Б1 Salvador is not going to come out of the barrel of a gun. Peace has to be gradually forged in the political understanding of the various forces involved. Xs part of that national understanding  the negotiations between the Government of the Republic and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Force (FMLH) are a crucial factor  and they must be promoted and conducted in a reasonable manner so that they may yield permanent results for the benefit of all our people.Throughout the year that has elapsed since I had the honour of speaking from this rostrum  we have made constant efforts on behalf of political negotiations with a view to ending the conflict. I do not wish to dwell on the regrettable fact that the FMLN broke off negotiations in November last year and launched a very violent offensive which struck unjustly at the civilian population  already severely battered by war. We have come here not to complain about what has happened in the past but rather to explain the positive things that are going on.At the beginning of this year we came to the United Nations to request its assistance in restoring the negotiating process. This came about in April  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  who has at all times been eager to bring all his wisdom and energy to bear in the service of the cause of peace in El Salvador. Through his worthy representative  Mr. De Soto  we have succeeded in re-establishing the negotiating process  and this is now moving forward at such a pace that concrete results are already being achieved. Last July a substantive agreement was signed between the Government and the FMLN on the crucial aspect of respect for and guaranteeing of human rights in the country. As a consequence of that the Security Council has authorised the Secretariat to establish in El Salvador an office to do the preparatory work dealing with the verification of the agreements in all spheres that the process will produce.I wish to emphasise that our Government places the highest possible value on the verification to be carried out by the United Nations in every aspect of the agreements resulting from the peace process. We are firmly committed to ensuring that this verification will be timely  broad and sufficient  without short-cuts or ambiguities. The first guarantee for peace in El Salvador is  of course  the determination of the people to achieve peace  as indicated by the serious and constant functioning of the peace machinery  both at the negotiating table and away from that table. The other guarantee is international verification  for the effectiveness of which we are prepared to give our full support and the assurances required  now and in  be future. The verification model we have supported and agreed upon in order to end this conflict once and for all is unprecedented  and this in itself is a way of demonstrating to the world our determination to achieve harmony and our absolute sincerity with regard to the free and peaceful future of the country.Our view of peace in El Salvador comprises three fundamental elements: the strengthening of unrestricted political pluralism  in the terms guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic; the consolidation of democratic institutions  with the unequivocal pre-eminence of the civilian branch of authority  deriving from the will of the people; and sustained and balanced economic and social development which will make it possible for El Salvador to build a model of prosperity in which everyone will have an opportunity for advancement.We are opposed to the paternalism which causes peoples to become stultified and the populism which impoverishes them by deceiving them  and also to simplistic economic formulas which fail to take into account the human dimension of development. We believe primarily in the creative productive spirit of the human being and his inherent freedom  and that is why we have designed and put into effect a pattern of measures which  while gradually improving the economy  will make possible the realistic and accelerated reconstruction of the country. This obviously has a high political cost  but we are prepared to confront that  because we are guided by the interests of our nation. We also know that this way of thinking and this type of economic action now prevail in the world and this encourages us to move ahead without vacillation although we are prepared to make corrections and changes as necessary when the objective reality of our country so requires.We are aware that in El Salvador a radical change is taking place  the outcome of the most profound crisis in our history. National salvation  which is the ultimate goal of my Government involves the purification of practically all our institutions and of course the armed forces are no exception.In all honesty we can say that the civilian branch of authority is becoming stronger and stronger in our country and that  within the present process of institutional modernisation  each sector is taking its place within the orderly framework of a functional democracy.Those who want to see El Salvador as it was in 1979 want to live in the past because they are either biased or blind. The decade of the 1960s has taught us in El Salvador more than we could have learnt in all the previous decades since independence. In the first place it has taught us the irreplaceable value of democracy  which is the best school of moderation. In democracy only the moderate prosper and the best proof of moderation is strict compliance with the laws. That is why our struggle is one on behalf of rationality and understanding and the peaceful coexistence of brothers - because we have already seen for ourselves the madness of war and we do not want even the slightest root of that fratricidal madness to remain in our soil. Our Government is a full-fledged member of the civilised community of nations and in this respect we assume the international responsibilities incumbent upon us. El Salvador is at this time making legitimate use of this status by having recourse to the International Court of Justice together with our sister Republic of Honduras in order to seek a settlement to a century-old frontier dispute which we hope will be terminated once and for all in mid-19Sl. Our country as we have undertaken to do and as indeed is our obligation  by virtue of our voluntary acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court  will comply with the Court's ruling on this frontier dispute. Moreover El Salvador is fully confident that the Secretary-General of the United Nations through the Security Council  and at the request of the Presidents of Central America  particularly the President of El Salvador will continue to pursue his active mediation to resolve by political negotiations  the internal conflict still affecting our people.Ha uphold international law absolutely and unequivocally. Our confidence in international machinery to foster the peaceful settlement of all kinds of conflicts is total. As regards the domestic conflict which is afflicting us  and which we feel now is completely out of date and totally unwarranted  our position is quite clear. We want a comprehensive solution to this conflict. We hope that the FMHŁ  having become a totally political force  will participate with all the guarantees which all political parties have in the democratic life of the country  and we trust that the solution to be found to the conflict will serve  as Mr. Perez de Cuellar rightly observes in his annual report to the Organisation  to lead ""to a positive transformation of Salvadorian society"". (A 45 1. p„ ft)We look towards the past only to learn positive lessons from it  not to try to reproduce it in any way  shape or form. The responsibility of Salvadorians for this decisive phase of our history is so great that we do not believe in the simplicity of superficial solutions. All our programmes and goals look forward towards the immediate future and the more remote future. It would be suicidal to cling to vices  shortcomings and arbitrary behaviour or archaic privileges. Life is evolving  and minds must evolve also so that actions will respond to deeds and not to ideological mirages of any sort.We want to live in peace. We are working to ensure that a firm and lasting peace will take root  in which there will be no type of oppression  no type of impunity and no type of exclusive fanaticism. Democracy is our ideal  and we dedicate our full energy every day to strengthening it. Democracy is built each day more with simple facts than with spectacular posturing. In that simple  natural and democratic way  we exercise power. We also nurture power in that way  because it is not our power and not anyone else's. It is the power of the people. This may seem mere talk but  in fact  it really represents our maximum challenge and  eventually  it will be our greatest conquest: affirming civil authority  not as an arbitrary type of rule  but as the authority leading the destiny of a pluralistic society  which we already are and which we shall increasingly be  in a peaceful manner.There is no longer any reason for war to exist in El Salvador. We do not want war in El Salvador. Interpreting the mood of the people  from this rostrum  which is the highest rostrum of the nations  we would say to all the national forces  the Government of the Republic El Salvador is prepared to do its utmost  with flexibility and serenity as necessary  in order to continue to seek an exemplary peace such as the Salvadorian people deserves. In this respect  we have only two unswerving principles to uphold: the fundamental principles of representative democracy and respect for law. As regards respect for the law  we realise that it may change  of course  in accordance with the needs of the time  but change must be carried out on the rails established by the law itself. Political and social reason can motivate such change  but it can never be motivated by arbitrary wishes or the caprice of individuals or groups.Particularly  we address the FMNL and urge it to make a mutual exercise of flexibility and realistic understanding at the negotiating table. We have repeatedly said that the mere fact that we have proposed  from the first days of our tern in Government  a permanent dialogue to seek a lasting peace in our country already moves us away from the fruitless and sterile  quarrelsome notion of victors and vanquished. Rather  we believe that this war has left us all with great lessons which we should learn so that we can put into practice these lessons to secure the peace which we want and which the country needs.No one is trying to destroy anyone else  neither at the negotiating table  nor away from the negotiating table  nor after the negotiating table. Far from it. The greatest responsibility we have is to lower the level of individual and collective passions and to make a supreme effort of tolerance. Political and moral reasons provide abundant support for this attitude.In accordance with the trend in today's world  and interpreting the mood of the international community  which has been set forth from this rostrum by the morally powerful voice of our sister Republic  Costa Rica  an example of democracy in the world  we are prepared to declare a unilateral cease-fire  to be put into effect as soon as the FMNL decides likewise - and this to make it possible for negotiations to move forward in an atmosphere marked by less tension and greater trust and  in particular  to provide real signals to the Salvadorian people that the political will of both parties is now firmly and permanently addressed to peace. That would be a temporary measure of effective good will  not intended to gain breathing space in the war  but rather to cement credibility and peace until the political agreements leading to a definitive cessation of armed confrontation can be arrived at. We are sure that a cease-fire decided on unilaterally by each one of the parties  which would enter into force at the same time  would speed up the negotiations because  in the phase that we are in now  violence merely impedes that process. Violence has many times been used as an alleged means of pressure to bring about a final solution  and all it has done is aggravate the war. Let us begin to use the resources of progressive peace-making  which are those which reality demands of us  and which the people  universally  in its suffering and stoicism yearns for.As to the agreement on human rights entered into by the Government and the FMMŁ in San José  for us its validity is immediate  and we are prepared to welcome international verification by the United Nations when the Organisation so agrees. Let us hop  that this will be as soon as possible.This session of the General Assembly will be remembered for very varied reasons. It is the first which has occurred since the dismantling of the cold war. However  it is taking place at a time when there are serious prospects for a regional conflict in the Middle East in which  at this very time  there is extreme tension between the forces of reason and right and those of outrageous arbitrary behaviour and barbarity.In Europe  an impressive phenomenon is occurring. It will reach a culmination on 3 October  with the unification of Germany  which until only a few months ago seemed such a remote possibility. We welcome it and we congratulate its protagonists. This general situation of renewal and rapprochement in Europe on the threshold of 1992  when united Europe will give a new face to contemporary history  is another vivid lesson for the peoples. Two new Members have joined our Organisation - Liechtenstein and Namibia. Ha welcome both of them with deep satisfaction. In the special case of Namibia  we wish to emphasise the role played by the international community  particularly the United Nations  in the satisfactory and civilised culmination of the lengthy struggle of the noble Namibian people to achieve their independence. This is a step that provides well-founded hope to trust that definitive stability is possible in the short-term in southern Africa in the light of the principles of equality and freedom  which are necessary for a lasting solution to national and international conflicts in today's world. We viewed with pleasure the current dialogue between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  and we fervently hope that it will come to fruition for the benefit and prosperity of the noble Korean nation. None the less  we believe that there is no need to delay any further the acceptance of the Republic of Korea as a member of the United Nations  since it meets the prerequisites for membership and since  moreover  its participation would be of great value for attaining the purposes of the Charter.In another connection  this Assembly will also be remembered for the unprecedented Presidential Summit for Children and for the unanimous concern of Governments about the catastrophic dangers of environmental deterioration  the drug traffic and drug addiction. The subject of the protection and restoration of life is now very much in the forefront of mankind's consciousness  and that fact is reflected as one of the principal concerns of this body. We join in this great effort in behalf of life on our turbulent planet and we declare our endorsement now for any initiative agreed upon in this respect. In our country  we are working pragmatically for the benefit of children and are firmly committed to bringing about a drastic reduction in the levels of malnutrition and disease and in the rate of school drop-outs during our remaining years in office. We are making a frontal assault on drug abuse and are determined to save the environment  for which we have designed  inter alia  a programme of national parks that will constitute inviolable reserves for the future.The United Nations has been playing and will continue to play a primary role in bringing peace to Central America. We reiterate in this Assembly the need for the United Nations Observer Group in Central America to remain active  now more than ever  in order to guarantee the security of the region and eventually help to give final form to the peace agreement in El Salvador. We view the development of Central American and Salvadorian events with hope and realism. Our Government has declared the year 1990-1991 the Tear of Peace. Peace is on the move. We say this with firm conviction. In the last year we have worked tirelessly for peace. The Salvadorian people fervently prays and eagerly hopes that war will disappear from our land. From this rostrum  we wish to ask God to enlighten all of us so that we may soon find the only path that will lead us to the future national reconciliation."
"131",6373,"SOM",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  I should like to extend to you  Sir  most sincere felicitations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Feel confident that under your able leadership and wise guidance  which stem from your rich and varied experience in your country's public life and international diplomacy  we can look forward to the smooth and efficient conduct and successful outcome of the work of this session of the General Assembly. I would like to assure you of my delegation's unstinting co-operation in the achievement of these objectives.I also take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the outstanding stewardship of your predecessor and our brother from Africa  Major-General Joseph Garba  who contributed to the successful outcome of the forty-fourth session of this body  including its sixteenth  seventeenth and eighteenth special sessions.We pay our tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts in making the United Nations an effective instrument for the promotion of world peace  security and development. It is with profound satisfaction that we welcome the emergence of a united Germany as a sovereign  independent State. The goal of German unification has been achieved through a peaceful democratic process and in exercise of the right of self-determination of the German people as a whole. Somalia extends heartfelt congratulations to the new State and look forward to close and fruitful co-operation in the years ahead.On behalf of my delegation  I also congratulate the Principality of Liechtenstein on its admission to membership of the United Nations.Since our last session  Namibia has taken its rightful place in the comity of the world's free and independent nations. While we justly rejoice at that happy elimination of the long and arduous struggle of the brave Namibian people against an oppressive racist regime  we cannot forget that the basic structure of the system of apartheid still remains in place in South Africa. However  a number of positive developments in recent months provide hopeful signs. Most important among these developments are the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and some other political leaders  and the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania  and other political parties and organisations. Therefore  while there is reason for cautious optimism  especially in the context of the ongoing negotiations between the ANC  led by Mr. Nelson Mandela  and President F.H. de Klerk  the international community has a duty to continue to bring pressure to bear on the Pretoria regime until the latter brings about genuine reforms leading to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a truly multiracial democratic society in South Africa. Until this happens  international sanctions against South Africa must continue to be maintained.We are concerned about the large-scale violence and conflict within the black community in some of the townships in South Africa. We sincerely hope that the spirit of good will and understanding  which currently prevails in that country  will bring peace  tranquillity and harmony among the people in the affected areas.The world today is passing through a period which is full of promise and  at the same time  has a potential for conflicts and confrontation. The end of the cold war era  dominated by ideological conflict  has ushered in a new era of understanding and co-operation. The recent spirit of conciliation and compromise among the major Powers would have been unthinkable only a short time ago. Today  it is clearly reflected in the near-unanimity of approach and action among the permanent members of the Security Council towards the peaceful resolution of global conflict situations.In Europe  dramatic changes have taken place in the political and economic fields. The most vivid manifestation of this historic phenomenon is the rebirth of a single German State cut of the two separate German entities  which until recently had divergent political ideologies. It also marks an important milestone in the history of Europe.But this spirit of solidarity and unity is not manifested in Europe alone. In the Arabian peninsula  my delegation welcomes the unification of the two former States of Yemen  in the new Republic of Yemen. We congratulate the brotherly people of Yemen and wish them peace and prosperity. In the Korean peninsula  the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas have recently begun contacts with a view to initiating a climate of friendship and understanding  which could eventually lead to the realisation of the shared aspirations of the peoples of the two countries for their peaceful reunification. The desire for unification cannot be regarded as being in contradiction with the membership of this universal body  as is clearly proven by the unification of the two Germanys and the two Yemens. In accordance with the principle of universality  Somalia supports the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations as full Members.In South-East Asia  too  there is a gentle breeze of change. The recent breakthrough in the ongoing negotiations on the long and tragic conflict in Kampuchea provides new hope for peace in the region. We fervently hope that it will now be possible to achieve a comprehensive political settlement  satisfactory to all concerned  which will bring to an end the sufferings of the people of Kampuchea and enable them to rebuild their lives and their nation. We hope that the potential threat to peace and security in the region that this conflict has posed would thus be removed.Hearer home  in the contest of the progress which is being made in Western Sahara  my delegation feels confident that before long the efforts of the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity and those of the Secretary-General of the United Nations will bear fruit in arriving at a satisfactory political solution to this question.Despite these favourable developments  it is regrettable that many conflicts still continue to rage  many injustices still remain to be corrected and many problems still remain to be resolved before we can confidently proclaim that mankind has overcome its primordial instinct and is now mature enough to achieve lasting peace based on justice. In the Middle East  in Afghanistan and in Cyprus  people continue to suffer the ravages of injustice and war. In Cyprus  only inter-communal talks and a genuine dialogue can show the way towards a just solution by peaceful means. It is our sincere hope that the parties involved will take advantage of the Secretary-General's mediation offer to find a solution  taking into account the fundamental rights of both the communities.As to Afghanistan  the withdrawal of foreign troops had heightened expectations for an early resolution of the conflict. We are  however  concerned that the situation in the country continues to be marked by violence  bringing widespread suffering to the people of Afghanistan. Millions of Afghans  particularly women and children  are still in refugee camps  unable to return to their homes. We urge all the parties concerned to make every effort to resolve their differences and get on with the task of reconstruction of that territory  which has gone through years of destruction and devastation.The most persistent and the most intransigent problem is that in the Middle East. For forty years  the situation in the Middle East has been the cause of tension resulting in several wars. It has destabilised countries  caused devastation to the people of the region and destroyed their lives by denying them their basic human rights. The root cause of this situation is clear and well-known: the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to their homeland. The situation has been further exacerbated by the continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands in defiance of the United Nations resolutions and in violation of international law. The courageous uprising  intifadah  of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza is an eloquent reminder that peace cannot be attained in the region unless the rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored. Somalia has consistently maintained that the only solution to this problem lies in the return of all Arab territories and the exercise of the inalienable right to self-determination by the Palestinian people. We have always extended our unequivocal support to our Palestinian brothers in their legitimate struggle. We continue to support the convening of the international conference on the Middle East with the participation of Palestine on an equal footing with other parties. We believe that such a conference will provide a unique opportunity for negotiations on the basis of the General Assembly resolutions on the Middle East.Since last August  there has been a new and dangerous threat to international peace and security. Favourable political developments have been overshadowed by the grave developments in the Gulf. The invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq has generated a global political and economic crisis. Our proximity to the conflict area and our fraternal ties with both Iraq and Kuwait make this situation all the more tragic and painful for us. For are we unaware of the political and economic consequences of this situation. The Gulf crisis has generated world-wide repercussions  causing military build-up and economic dislocation. However  the consequences of war would be much more dangerous and far-reaching. Somalia  therefore  is fully supportive of all efforts aimed at finding a political solution to the problem.Somalia considers Iraq's action to be in violation of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that a solution to the conflict can be achieved only on the basis of the following central elements  first  immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of sovereignty and legitimacy in Kuwait; secondly  subsequent to the attainment of the aforementioned objective  negotiations should be undertaken in the search for a political solution to the differences between Kuwait and Iraq.For Somalia  the situation in the Gulf is particularly painful  for it involves two fellow members of the Arab League  the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Hon-Aligned Countries with both of whom Somalia has close fraternal ties. We therefore wish to see an early resolution of this serious crisis in the interests of the peace and stability of the region.I would now like to touch briefly upon the steps my Government has recently taken in the direction of the ongoing democratization process which it had initiated last year. On the recommendations of the Government  the People's Assembly has recently adopted the new amended Constitution which  inter alia  provides for a multiparty democracy  a free market economic system and the protection of fundamental human rights. Efforts are also under way to open meaningful dialogue with the opposition groups to promote peace and national reconciliation. The significant initiatives taken by my Government will no doubt contribute to the restoration of stability in the country and to the improvement of the economic and social conditions of our people.Earlier in my address  I made a reference to the new and welcome changes that were sweeping the world. The end of the ideological confrontation between the super-Powers has helped to create new hopes for global peace and improvement in the human condition. These developments have brought about a trend towards conciliation and understanding on the part of the major Powers  and have opened up new possibilities for substantial progress on disarmament and arms reduction. However  the improvement in the East-West political climate has failed to make any impact  has done nothing to ameliorate the rapidly deteriorating economic conditions in such of the developing world. Deeply rooted inequities and imbalances continue to afflict inter-State relations  especially between the industrial and the developing countries. Many third-world countries continue to experience economic stagnation  increased poverty and an overall deterioration in the social progress of their peoples. In many of these countries the number of people living in poverty is increasing at an alarming pace. Today more than 1 billion people live in conditions of abject poverty. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation  the number of people who now lack food is estimated to be over 900 million and the number of people with serious health risks because of caloric deficiencies is above to reach the 400 million mark.The debt problem  which emerged in almost all developing countries in the early 1980s  has since grown out of proportion and is now threatening to disrupt the social order and political stability of many third-world countries. Despite the endless and strenuous adjustment efforts and debt rescheduling by these countries  the prevailing international financial and monetary system makes it virtually impossible for the affected developing countries to cope with the burden. In his annual report on the work of the Organisation for 1990  the Secretary-General points out that in 1989 alone $26 billion was transferred from the developing to the developed countries. This alone is a serious impediment to the efforts of the developing countries and must be stopped and reversed.A number of new initiatives are in place  but what is required is a new  vigorous and dynamic debt strategy. Such a strategy must include debt cancellation as well as substantially increased resources. The problem of debt rescheduling and the net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries are closely linked to the problem facing the developing countries in the field of international trade  a viable and effective debt strategy would also need to provide for sustainable growth in developing countries  including in-depth measures designed to increase their export earning capacity.The serious economic situation of the least developed countries should be a cause  for grave concern. Increasing poverty  widespread hunger and malnutrition have become painful daily occurrences in many of these economies  we welcome the results of the recently concluded second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris. The Conference recognised the importance of national policies and their links to the international environment. Unfortunately  however  it was unable to reach an agreement on increased financial flows and on new measures to alleviate the debt burden of the least developed countries.Speaking about my own country  Somalia is today faced with serious economic problems. Like some of the other least developed countries in Africa  Somalia has to cope with the grave problem of the influx of a large number of refugees. This has caused shortages of food  and the Government is compelled to bear the heavy burden of these costs to the detriment of the country's economic growth and development.We are grateful to the international agencies  and in particular to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  for their assistance in trying to mitigate the situation. We would  however  like to urge them not only to continue the assistance but to redouble their efforts without allowing extraneous political considerations to interfere with the humanitarian cause. Let me refer to some positive developments on the economic scene. First  of course  is the positive outcome of the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to international economic co-operation and in particular to the revitalisation of the economic growth and development of the developing countries. The consensus arrived at in the Declaration augurs well for strengthened international economic co-operation. In this context we have also noted the calls from the Secretary-General as well as from other important world leaders for more orderly management of the world economy. We fully support the call for initiating a world-wide comprehensive dialogue on all complex economic issues to create a better future for mankind.The start of the decade of the i99Qs has witnessed the beginning of the end of the cold war and confrontation  especially between the super-Powers  which has  among other things  brought about a resemblance of international security. None the less  our world remains at a cross-roads.While the rivalry of the major-Powers in their race for the acquisition and stockpiling of deadly weapons has receded to a large extent  making the threat of the possible annihilation of mankind - if not of our planet itself - unlikely  a different kind of threat looms large before us and it is imperative that we take immediate preventive measures.As I said earlier  deeply rooted inequities and imbalances continue to plague inter-State relations. These have inevitably given rise to wealth and prosperity for a few while the majority of the world's population is compelled to lead an existence of perennial poverty  hunger and disease. Such wide disparities in the world's living standards are like a volcano which is bound to erupt at any moment  nullifying all the gains achieved at the political level. It should be apparent that such a dangerous situation cannot be met effectively without sustained and sincere efforts aimed at international co-operation and understanding. In the fountainhead of such a co-operative effort the United Nations will have to play an active role not only in trying to ameliorate the miserable plight of the world's poor  but also in bringing about a just and equitable world order as stipulated in the Charter.My delegation has no doubt that the Member nations  big and small  will rise to the occasion and extend their unstinted co-operation to the Organization in the fulfilment of this onerous task."
"132",6442,"SUR",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Government and the people of Suriname  I bring you greetings as well as congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session.Your diplomatic skills and insight into international affairs are well known and  indeed  widely respected. We are therefore pleased to see you in this high office and offer you our full support.We should also like to express; our appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Joseph Garba  for the skilful and knowledgeable manner in which he carried out the functions of the presidency during the previous session.Furthermore  I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Javier Peres de Cuellar  who ones again put forth his best efforts in the performance of his tasks. We are facing an endless stream of problems  not least of which is the present situation in the Gulf region  and he meets those challenges with diplomatic tact and skill  patience and wisdom.My delegation would like at this time to evil itself of this opportunity to bid a hearty welcome to the newest Member of our family of nations the principality of Liechtenstein. We look forward to developing and maintaining fruitful relations with this sinter nation.It is gratifying that in a time of great changes the United Nations is resolutely carrying out its mandate and continuing to demonstrate its usefulness and importance as a legitimate vehicle for the preservation and consolidation of peace and security in the world.It is the impartiality of the United Nations  its ability to take all legitimate interests into account  that makes it the most focal and appropriate institution for making and keeping peace.The United Nations system  which was established on the foundation of a legal system of civilised international coexistence  has much too often been involved in achieving peace in the face of the hard reality of the balance of power and of international law and justice. If the 45 years of existence of this Organisation has taught us anything  it is that the United Nations is a durable and highly viable organisation and that the vision of the founding fathers was far-sighted. Now that the United Nations Charter has been fully recognised as a valid and essential guide  we cherish the hope that it can meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond.Two years ago I already had the pleasure of informing the Assembly about the new phase Suriname had entered into as a consequence of the genuine desire of the Surinamese people for democracy. But then it was already clear that the transformation of the political and social order would not be an easy task. In fact  diverging interests in society have been impeding the realization of the objectives set by the Government for this phase of the democratization process  in which prime consideration is given to the strengthening of a common awareness  a general societal participation and a national consensus in the interest of a sustained national development.My Government was pleased to find that in the community a number of initiatives were being taken aimed at promoting the essential national harmony  so to respond by initiating national dialogue as a constructive consensus mechanism. This mechanism  which embodies the mobilization of all social groups  should offer possibilities to work out strategies and to discuss the implementation of programmes aimed at the realisation of our national development.We do realise that this national development should take place within a specific institutional political and legal framework which is applicable to the entire territory and which promotes national stability  peace and security. It is obvious that without sustained national economic and social development all our efforts to reinstate and promote a constitutional democracy will be in vain. Therefore  we are convinced that our endeavours should be directed towards forging the national consensus I mentioned earlier and towards overcoming the present economic impediments.With its vast maritime area and hinterland and its abundant natural resources  Suriname has the physical basis to provide its population with an adequate living standard. However  the present social and economic conditions in the country have a negative impact on the full utilization of its natural potentials. Of course  we are convinced that no responsible Government can  for whatever reason  simply brush aside sound expert advice with regard to the internal causes of declining productivity and increasing inflation. Indeed  my Government has seriously embarked on the national preparation of a carefully considered programme  inspired by the need both for adjustment and for stability.We draw justification for our caution from a review of the results of adjustments which have been introduced in some countries and have had serious effects on the stability of democratic processes. Therefore  when external economic and political pressure is exerted in defiance of solemn commitments sealed in a treaty and in disregard of the historically determined complexity of our society  we do perceive not only a deviation from formal lofty principles  but also an unwarranted attempt to interfere in the decision-making process in our society.I am well aware that my country's problems  which I have just briefly touched upon  are not unique and apply to other countries as well. This is just one illustration of the adverse tendency in international economic relations  which is characterized by an ever-increasing gap between the industrialised North and the developing countries that are faced with increased dependency on foreign development-financing and the steadily growing impoverishment of their populations. Many of these developing countries have ceased to grow in per capita terms  and phenomena such as poverty  misery  malnutrition and even hunger are becoming more and more a common concern of many of these countries. In most developing countries  immense human deprivation persists: 1 billion people live in absolute poverty and 900 million receive no education  while 14 million children die every year before the age of five.During the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly   in April  representatives of various countries from the North and the South expressed their increasing disappointment with the results of the development strategy planned for the 1980s. The expression ""lost decade"" strikingly illustrates the enormous disillusion with regard to the economic position of the developing countries  despite the immense technological changes and dynamic growth that characterised the development of the rich countries.There is a growing awareness that our world is one of interdependent relationships  and that developments in one part of the world unavoidably affect other parts. Against this background it is not acceptable that islands of profusion and wealth exist in the midst of an ocean of scarcity and poverty. To reduce this gap between the rich and the poor countries it is desirable that urgent and effective measures be taken  such as the transfer of technology  the solution of the external-debt problem  access to the world trade market and adequate external financing. In this respect  my delegation hopes that the adoption of the new programme of action by the second Paris Conference on Least Developed Countries will indeed contribute to redressing the deterioration in the majority of developing countries. More than ever before the central role of the human factor in the development process has to be recognised. Health  nutrition  housing  population policies and other social services are a key to improving both individual welfare and successful development. Education and training  which must be available to all  are essential for improving the quality of human resources and for sustaining economic growth.The present international situation has  after the fundamental global changes that took place at the end of the decade  entered a new era. Some of the key assumptions  as well as structures and attitudes based on policies and concepts of the cold-war era  have become obsolete and are no longer adequate to serve the needs and imperatives of today. The end of the cold war and the end of the East-West confrontation now allow far cost savings through disarmament  which  in turn  can translate into more resources for development programmes in the developing countries.Along with the positive changes that have occurred in many parts of the world  the current turmoil and explosive situation in the Gulf region demonstrates however that relaxation of tension between the two main Powers has not embraced all areas of international relations nor has it led to a solution of one of the key international issues.The developments in the Gulf region have not only altered the balance of power in that region  but have also altered the balance of supply and demand in the world oil market. These events have already had a tremendous effect on the economies of many developing countries  especially the non-oil-producing ones.The Government of Suriname condemns the invasion of Kuwait and supports Security Council resolutions 660 (1990) and 661 (1990). Ha underline the principles of good-neighbourliness respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all States and the inadmissibility of any attempt to change a country's system of government by force.The present crisis once again brings into focus the vulnerability of small States in terms both of their security and of their sovereignty  and the need for special regional and international mechanisms addressing potentially dangerous threats to the security and sovereignty of small States  For this reason we urge the Secretary-General to explore ways and means for the facilities to be put in place within the framework of the United Nations Charter. The present crisis also highlights the urgent need for more intensive efforts to be made for the resolution of other crises such as the question of Palestine. In our view a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem is not possible without fully taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 /1973). Having said this  we feel that a comprehensive lasting and peaceful solution to the Middle East problem should be pursued within the framework of an international  peace conference under the auspices o£ the United Nations and with the participation of all relevant parties.Improved East-West relations have provided a positive momentum across the full range of areas control and disarmament issues. Although some hopeful bilateral agreements such as the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - IMF Treaty - have been reached and progress has been made in the fields of disarmament and confidence-building Measures  the explosive situation in the Gulf area demonstrates the sombre reality of the areas build-up. Hunan beings are not infallible  so in a strenuous situation even a well-intended decision can result in a miscalculation and lead to a serious threat to mankind  world peace and security; certainly in a situation like the one in the Gulf region  where it has already been proved that some countries do have chemical and nuclear weapons.Many Member States have time and time again called - without significant results however - upon the international community to negotiate a binding commitment to general and complete disarmament under effective international control. Complete disarmament should include nuclear arms  chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.The Gulf crisis must have taught us at least one lesson that the proliferation of chemical and nuclear weapons must be definitely and effectively stopped. My delegation is therefore pleased to note that a large part of the work of the Conference on Disarmament at its 1990 session was devoted to the ongoing elaboration of a Multilateral convention on the stockpiling of chemical weapons.Forces of change have indeed had »any effects and provided a powerful impetus to the struggle against domination such as the movement against apartheid in South Africa. Force  for a long period  has been the main weapon used to suppress the will of the majority of the South African people. There were more than enough weapons at the disposal of the apartheid regime and they did not lack readiness to use them against the oppressed people of South Africa. It is encouraging to note that the authorities in Pretoria have at long last accepted the inevitability of the demise of apartheid and conceded that negotiation is the only way to avoid a dangerous future. Nelson Mandela's triumphant release from prison was dramatic evidence of a changing South Africa.My Government welcomes the joint declaration of the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) of 6 August 1990 and the adoption by consensus of resolution 44/244 on 17 September 1990. We look forward to the time when the phenomenon of apartheid will truly be extinct and a united  non-racial South Africa  based on the United Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa has joined the Organization.She winds of change in international understanding have also touched on Cambodia. After many years of conflict and suffering in that country the recent agreement  reached in Jakarta  to form a national council based on the United Nations peace proposal  is a sign that the parties are moving towards a more concrete and hopeful state  clearing the way for a comprehensive and durable solution. We whole-heartedly welcome this agreement and urge the world community to encourage these developments which will offer the Cambodian people new perspectives for peace  stability and security.The prevailing level of international understanding is also having its beneficial impact on the problem of the Korean peninsula. The praiseworthy initiative of the leaders of the two States in arriving at a negotiated settlement deserves the support and encouragement of the world community. The Government of Suriname supports the aspirations of the South Korean Government to become a Member of the Organisation  as it is not unfavourably disposed towards separate membership of the two States involved in anticipation of the unification of the Korean people.The developments in Central America have now reached a stage which nurtures hope for a durable peace in the region but it is necessary to secure stability through progress in economic and social development.Suriname follows with great interest the preparations for the forthcoming elections in the Republic of Haiti. We cherish the hope that the electoral process will take place in a peaceful way  offering the Haitian people new hope to decide their own destiny. The nature and scope of global environmental problems are now widely known. Suriname is ready to contribute to a solution of these problems by preserving a substantial part of its rain forest. To this end  however  we have to overcome some obstacles. Our existing institutional framework regarding environmental policy has to be strengthened and supplemented while supplementary laws and regulations on the environment need to be enacted.At the regional level/ Suriname has actively played its part in this regard within the context of the Treaty of Amazonian Co-operation.We do hope that  during the upcoming discussions at regional and international levels  agreement will be reached with respect to solutions of problems related to the destruction of the environment.During the seventeenth special session  held in February this year  the General Assembly adopted by consensus a Political Declaration and a Global Programme of Action regarding the problem of illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse. During that session  practically all States and different organizations paid great attention to this problem and its negative effects.My Government has already taken measures at the national  bilateral and multilateral levels to prevent  curb and eradicate the illegal production  consumption and trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. We realise  though  that much remains to be done.I am taking this opportunity to pay a tribute to the United Nations for its constructive work in this field.The diplomatic activity pursued by the international community over many years through the United Nations has at last begun to bear fruit. This  among other matters  is mainly due to an international climate in which tensions have been eased by markedly improved relations between the two major Powers.The international community is rediscovering the usefulness and indispensability of multilateralism. It has been given new opportunities actively to perform its task of maintenance of international peace and security. The United Nations and its principal organs are beginning to live up to the high expectations of the world community.However  this somewhat idyllic portrayal of the changes in international political relations must not lead us to overlook the sources of international conflict that keep darkening the sky   such as world poverty  the debt problem  environmental destruction  the rampant drug problem and the injustices that mark international economic relations. These sources  plus the recent conflict that has arisen in the Gulf region which threatens world peace  have proved clearly that expected benefits of an improved political climate are neither automatic nor balanced.World history has shown time and again that the propensity of certain States to take unilateral action in order to further their national interests has been the greatest threat to international security because it has led to tensions  conflict and the use of military force.The current complex and contradictory international situation makes it necessary that the peace-keeping potential of multilateralism be exploited to the fullest for the benefit of all mankind."
"133",6536,"SWE",45,1990,"﻿I have come to this Assembly to pay a warm tribute and to confirm a deep commitment. My tribute is directed to this world Organisation and to its dedicated and loyal servants. In the new international political climate  but also when faced by a sudden crisis  the United Nations has lived up to our high expectations.The commitment I wish to confirm is of the people and Government of Sweden - to the United Nations system  to its Charter  and to its principles of collective security. Our nation  as always  stands ready to contribute to the implementation of the decisions of the Organization. And let me assure the Secretary-General that he has our full support for his leadership of the United Nations.In the last few years we have seen a dramatically improved international situation. The two major Powers are shaping a fundamentally new relationship. Nuclear arsenals are being reduced. Conventional forces are withdrawn. Offensive military doctrines are becoming obsolete. The Cold War is over.We have all benefited from these developments. The risk of a nuclear war that could destroy our entire civilisation has been greatly reduced. And opportunities for peaceful change and for peaceful settlement of conflicts have been created.In southern Africa  Namibia is now as independent nation. In South Africa itself fundamental change has been initiated. Nelson Mandela is free  after 27 years in prison. As the  oral leader of that nation he is negotiating with President De Klerk on the abolition of the apartheid system. In Chile  a democratically elected President has replaced a Military dictator. In Central America  the peace process is continuing  with the active involvement of the United Nations. In Cambodia a solution that has the backing of all parties seems to be within reach. In Europe there is a new atmosphere of optimism and trust  of co-operation and integration. The Berlin Nail has finally been demolished. Only five days from now  the two German States - symbol of a divided Europe - will be united. In Central and Eastern Europe  democratic elections are being held in one country after another. The dictatorships have been overthrown by the peaceful force of the will of the people. And we look forward to the day when the three Baltic Republics will regain their independence in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act.All this is a breakthrough for the vision of a Europe without borders  for the ideas of visionary leaders like Jean Monnet  Willy Brandt and Olof Palme. After confrontation and rearmament  we have dialogue and co-operation. The final victor on the European continent is democracy itself. For all of us this in a source of great joy. And all around the world  that so many have worked for so long  is now finally turning into reality.In spite of the joy and the optimism of the past year  new threats to our common security can still occur. And they did  as we all know  on the morning of 2 August. The invasion of Kuwait by I rag is an act of aggression and a fundamental breach of international law. It is justly and unequivocally condemned by the international community. The way that Iraq is treating hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals demonstrates a total lack of human decency. To force thousands to stay in the country against their will shows an arrogant disregard for international law. A catastrophe in the Gulf area must be avoided. Iraq must immediately end its occupation of Kuwait  withdraw all its troops  and give all foreigners the freedom to depart. The legitimate government of Kuwait must be restored.The situation around the Gulf is extremely serious. But much has changed in the world in the last few years - and this also has clear implications for the current crisis. Today  the super-Powers consult each other  at the highest level. Today  the United States and the Soviet Union are co-operating here at the United Nations. And today the United Nations Security Council has been able to take swift decisions on effective mandatory sanctions against Iraq.This firm action gives us hope that the current crisis can be solved. But it also marks a turning-point for the fundamental idea of collective security. Sweden supports all the decisions taken by the Security Council in the present crisis. My Government also supports the declared readiness of the Council to take further action  if necessary  to force Iraq to end its aggression. If the Council were to call for a peace-keeping force in connection with an Iraqi withdrawal  our country would respond positively to such a request.The current international efforts mist focus also on the need for humanitarian assistance. The hundreds of thousands of refugees in the area need our help - with food and shelter and with transportation to their bone countries.The United Nations should be at the centre of these efforts - to help and to organise and co-ordinate the contributions of donor countries. Effective action the Organisation in the humanitarian field will help to strengthen its role in future crises end conflicts. Sweden will participate actively in this work.The crisis in the Persian Gulf is part of the complex Middle East situation. Still  it cannot be directly linked to the solution of other conflicts in the region. An international conference on the Middle East is needed more than ever before.A recent report from the United Nations estimates that the growth rate in the industrialised nations will exceed 3 per cent per year in the 1990s. But for developing countries growth will not match the increase in population. Mere people will have less to share. Heavy debt burdens will aggravate the problems. Unemployment will grow. Illiteracy will spread. The situation will go from bad to worse.This is another warning of possible future global confrontations between rich and poor. It could indicate that there may be grounds for a future bitter struggle between the industrialised developed countries  on the one hand  and the poor countries  on the other. This ¿s what could happen. But it does not have to happen. And it cannot be allowed to happen. It is possible to steer events in another direction. The richer countries must show that we take the problems of the poorer nations seriously  that we respect the rights  the culture and the individuality of other nations and regions Above all we must show that the basic values of justice and solidarity  freedom and self-determination do not apply to just our own country or our own continent: they apply to all nations all over the world.If justice and solidarity do not have global relevance  then gaps will widen and confrontations will sharpen  economically and politically  culturally and socially. That is why we must take action. We must reverse the trend. We must increase the flow of resources from North to South. Otherwise we run the risk of seeing many more violent conflicts in the years to come. And  worst of all  this will endanger the future of the world's children.The social and economic conditions in the world today can have awesome consequences for the younger generation. During this decade we shall witness the birth of the largest generation in the history of the planet  with some l.5 billion children being born. But millions of those children will be permitted to live only a short time on Earth. Bach day 40 000 children die  many of them from diseases that could easily be prevented. The world now has the means to protect the lives of all children  to ensure their survival  to promote their development. We know how to do it. What we now need is the commitment to take action. The World Summit for Children this week-end provides a unique opportunity to make such a commitment. Leaders of some 70 nations will then be able to state together that the rights of the child shall come first on their agendas. The Convention on the Bights of the Child is an excellent instrument for meeting that commitment. At this very moment we have a special opportunity to fulfil that goal. At a tins of a now relationship between East and West  spending on military armaments can be cut back substantially. Military budgets are being reduced in both East and West. A high proportion of these savings can and should be used to promote the development of the poor countries. In fact  right now we have a unique chance to take a bold initiative for improving North-South relations. This is matter of basic solidarity with people in other countries in difficult circumstances. But it is also an issue that is decisive for our common security.One other matter is linked with our common future in a very similar way the need to halt and reverse environmental degradation. This task has become a major challenge of the 1990s. In less than two gears' time the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will be meeting in Brazil. That Conference will have to make a number of important decisions.In 1972 the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm under the motto ""Only One Earth"". It endorsed the principle of joint action in the field of global concern. But that was not enough. The scale of the problems has vastly outpaced the fragmented measures taken so far.We know now with certainty that the climate of the Earth is changing. We are facing the tragedy of advancing deserts and retreating and dying forests. We are confronted with an ever-increasing loss of species  ever-scarcer fresh-water resources  destructive living conditions in urban areas and pressures of overpopulation. These problems jeopardize the livelihood  prosperity and security of present and future generations. They have come actually to threaten the entire global life-support system of our planet. Effective strategies are now needed  at the national  regional and global levels. We who belong to the affluent minority which consumes the majority of the resources will have to take the lead. But nobody will escape the responsibility to act.We shall all have to work together closely to avert economic and environmental disaster. We must now translate the concept of sustainable development into reality. To do this we need specific action on key issues. We need important structural changes within our countries. We must agree on modalities for the efficient transfer of environmentally sound technologies  and we must agree on how to provide additional financial resources to developing countries.We live in an age when the only possible course is to seek security together  common security. The time is past when each State could independently realise its goals and dreams within its own national boundaries. We want to work together to prevent conflicts  under joint responsibility. We do not want them to be handled by the great Powers on their own  however well-armed they are and however well-intentioned they may be. More clearly than ever before  we see the need for an effective system of collective security. Our goal is a system where we all help protect each other  where we feel secure in the knowledge that an attack on any one of us will not be tolerated by anyone else.Our goal is a system which has effective institutions for solving conflicts and for handling new threats to our security before these threats develop into violent confrontations.Our goal is a system which builds on a common interest. That interest is already clearly defined in the Charter: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".Our goal is a system which can deal with underlying causes of conflict  with economic misery and social injustice  denial of human rights and environmental degradation.Our goal  finally  is & system which is built on respect for international law and which gives freedom and justice to all.That is what the United Nations should be; that is what it can be; and now the important goal is beginning to be realised  a dream has started to come true - the dream that  united together in this world Organisation  we can protect the security of each and every one of us. We have vested part of our sovereignty in the Security Council in order to allow the United Nations to act forcefully in a crisis.Our Organisation has achieved impressive results in recent years. It has also expanded its scope. What we now see taking shape is an effective United Nations system for security and co-operation.In peace-keeping the traditional tasks remain while new functions are being developed. Troops and military observers still form the backbone of peace-keeping operations. But the civilian component is growing  with an increasing role for the United Nations in election supervision and building of democratic structures. The monitoring of elections in Nicaragua and Namibia is one example.In peace-making  the United Nations has proved its value in a number of regional conflicts. Other important and difficult tasks lie ahead such as Western Sahara and Cambodia. The United Nations will also have to face the problem of how to deal with internal conflicts often with an ethnic background.In peace-building  the United Nations has to develop a co-ordinated strategy for dealing with the fundamental economic and social problems confronting the world of today. Poverty  environmental degradation and the awesome spread of drug abuse are global issues which must be dealt with through joint action.The great hopes for this organization must not be frustrated by a lack of resources. Therefore  it is not acceptable that it still has to face serious financial problems.My Government is especially concerned that peace-keeping activities run the serious risk of being hampered due to lack of funds. It has been said before  but it has to be repeated: every Member State must pay its contribution in full and on time. For too many years  the work of the United Nations was hampered by the cold war. The Security Council was crippled by the frequent use of the veto. And this Assembly was too often a platform for propaganda battles.A much more constructive atmosphere now prevails in the Organisation. The era of confrontation has largely been replaced by consensus-seeking and pragmatic solutions.My message from the people and the Government of Sweden is one of solid support for these changes. As a nation outside military alliances  we only have ourselves to rely on in time of conflict. We therefore have a strong interest in a forceful United Nations and in the rule of law in international relations. That is why we in Sweden so energetically welcome and support the revitalized role of the United Nations as an organisation for collective security. It offers the machinery for co-operation between the large and the many smaller States in the world. It gives every nation a chance to participate in the work for peace and a better future. We can now develop the United Nations into an effective system for security  co-operation and development.I am convinced that the nations of the world are ready to respond to that challenge. It will require inspired leadership and a concrete and firm commitment. The United Nations has a tremendous potential for keeping the peace  for making peace and for building peace. It symbolizes our dream of a world together. It is a world which is one and indivisible  with a common heritage and a common future."
"134",6574,"SWZ",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of my Head of State  His Majesty King Mswati III  the Government and people of the Kingdom of Swaziland  I should like at the very outset to convey to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the Assembly. Your election to guide the deliberations of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly is indeed a clear indication of the confidence the Assembly has in you as an accomplished diplomat of outstanding ability. My delegation has no doubt  therefore  that our session will greatly benefit from having at its helm a person of your calibre who has a clear perspective of the various global problems facing mankind today.I should also like to express my delegation's sincere gratitude to your predecessor. Ambassador Joseph Garba of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  for the most distinguished manner in which he steered all the business of the Assembly during the last session. We were deeply impressed by his inspiring leadership and discerning insight into the various matters of concern to humanity that came up for discussion in this Hall during the past session.I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Principality of Liechtenstein most sincerely on its recent admission to membership of the United Nations. We wish it all the best as the newest partner in the community of nations. Forty-five long and eventful years have come and gone since the world body was founded in 1945. Since that date  the Organisation has played a role of paramount importance as an effective instrument for fostering international peace and security and as an indispensable forum in which to promote a spirit of greater co-operation and understanding among the inhabitants of this complex but increasingly interdependent world of ours.A great deal has been accomplished during the past 45 years. We have witnessed phenomenal changes taking place on the world's political map. We have seen the dismantling of colonial empires and the emergence of many new sovereign nations from the shadows of foreign domination to play their rightful role in the task of creating a more just and secure world in which the entire human race can live in relative peace and security.Indeed  the last few years have seen many encouraging signs that our long-troubled world is at last entering a promising new era of peace and security characterised by a growing willingness to resolve conflicts through peaceful dialogue. In this era of glasnost and perestroika  we have seen rivalry and mistrust being replaced by a new spirit of growing co-operation and mutual trust between the two super-Powers.The United States and the Soviet Union are to be commended for their decision to shift from confrontation to co-operation. The new and positive climate has given rise to a marked relaxation in East-West tension  thereby ending the cold-war spectre that had haunted East-West relations since the end of the Second World War.We have been equally encouraged by the changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe since December of last year. The most significant of those changes is the successful reunification on 3 October 1990 of Germany into a single nation after so many painful decades of division.We congratulate the people of Germany on that historic event and we sincerely hope that a united Germany will play an even greater role in promoting world peace and economic progress. We are accordingly convinced that the new phenomenon in East-West relations augurs well for the future of world peace and the security of all mankind.The welcome trend towards greater world peace and security has  however  been seriously marred by the recent events in the Gulf region. My delegation regards the unprovoked invasion and forcible annexation of Kuwait  a Member of the United Nations  as setting a very serious precedent which  if allowed to go unchecked by the world community  would pose a grave danger to the continued existence and independence of many small nations.Accordingly  the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to reaffirm its full support for the various resolutions adopted by the Security Council to end that act of naked aggression against the people of Kuwait. We equally condemn the holding of innocent civilians as hostages and their use as human shields in the Gulf crisis. We urge the Government of Iraq to free all hostages and to comply with the Security Council resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Iraqi military forces from Kuwait.My delegation wishes to congratulate the Secretary-General  his Special Representative and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group on their successful implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which ensured the holding of free and fair democratic elections in Namibia and the achievement of Namibia's long-awaited independence in March this year. We are indeed most grateful that  after many years of painful struggle  the people of Namibia is today a free and sovereign nation and has taken its rightful place in the General Assembly That remarkable achievement is undoubtedly a fine example of the important role played by the United Nations in promoting the process of decolonisation and in facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflict situations around the world. The successful implementation of the independence peace process and the arrival of an independent Namibia in the community of free nations have given a strong impetus to the current peace momentum in other parts of southern Africa. Several important and positive developments towards peace have  for instance  taken place in South Africa since February this year. We have witnessed with extreme joy the release from prison of Mr. Nelson Mandela; the unbanning of political organisations; the lifting of the state of emergency in three of the four provinces of South Africa; the repeal of certain apartheid laws and the start of exploratory talks between the South African Government and the representatives of black political organisations aimed at ending apartheid and at creating a new non-racial and democratic South Africa.We sincerely hope and pray that formal negotiations on the future constitution of a new South Africa will commence without any undue delay so that  for the first time  all the people of South Africa will be allowed the opportunity to contribute to the development of a new constitutional dispensation acceptable to all the people of that country.We are accordingly saddened by the current violence in Natal and in some of the black townships of South Africa involving mainly the black population of that country. This violence has already caused considerable unnecessary human suffering. Right now  many people have fled their homes and some of them have come to seek refuge in Swaziland in order to escape the current violence in South Africa. We therefore wish to appeal most earnestly to all political leaders in South Africa to bury their differences and to work together a spirit of brotherhood for the peaceful transition of their country to the post-apartheid era.We are convinced that the present violence is not in the last interests of the people of South Africa and that its persistence will only play into the hands of those elements in that society who are bent on preserving the status quo of apartheid. These elements should not be allowed to succeed in their aims to plunge the people of South Africa - the majority of whom are peace-loving and well prepared to accept a sew dispensation - into such unnecessary bloodshed. The tine must cone soon for our southern African region to reject the use of violence as a means of resolving political differences. Peace and political stability should be allowed to prevail in our region so as to enable southern Africa fully to exploit its vast potential for economic development.It is accordingly heartening to note that there are now improved prospects for bringing an end to the military conflicts in Angola and Mozambique  which have caused untold human suffering and wanted destruction of vital infrastructural facilities in these countries.In expressing the deep concern of the Kingdom of Swaziland about the conflict in Mozambique  I can do no better than reiterate the words of my Head of State  His Majesty  King Mswati the Third  in this very Hall last October  when he pointed out that the continuing war in Mozambique affects Swaziland in many ways. It spawns large numbers of refugees  now totalling over 50 000  who flee into Swaziland to stretch our limited resources in land  housing and employment  and so on  to the breaking-point.The delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland is highly appreciative of the vital role played by the United Nations  in conjunction with the Organization of African Unity  in the search for a just and lasting solution to the problem of Western Sahara. The meetings in the recent past between delegations from the Kingdom of Morocco and the POŁISARIO Front were a positive indication of the genuine desire of both parties to engage in a constructive dialogue on this problem.We accordingly commend the Secretary-General's efforts aimed at arranging a referendum which will enable the Saharawi people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. We similarly commend the untiring effort  of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity to find early solutions to the conflict between Chad and Libya and to the friction between Mauritania and Senegal.We wish to call upon all the parties involved in these two conflict situations to exercise the utmost restraint and to redouble their efforts in the search for peaceful solutions in the true fraternal spirit of African brotherhood.Swaziland is concerned that the current crisis in the Gulf has caused an interruption in the processes aimed at achieving a settlement of the problems affecting the coexistence of the Israeli and Palestinian people. We are hopeful that the interruption is only temporary  and we remain convinced that it is only through peaceful dialogue  involving all parties on an equal footing  that there can be any hope of a just and lasting solution to this long-standing problem.True to our country's policy of non-alignment  peaceful co-operation with all nations  and the acknowledgement of the prerogative of all peoples to self-determination  we recognise the right of both the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples to their own territories  each within secure borders.For decades the situation in Central America has posed a serious threat to international peace and security. It is however gratifying to note that at their summit meeting last year the five Central American States reached some important agreements which we hope will greatly promote the peace process in that region. In this regard  we welcome the creation of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission involving the deployment of United Nations military observers. We also commend the Nicaraguan Government for its bold step in inviting the United Nations and other bodies to send a group of observers to Nicaragua early this year to monitor the recent elections in that country. We likewise congratulate the Secretary-General who  through his good offices and remarkable diplomatic skills  succeeded in procuring a negotiated solution to the Central American conflict.The situation in Cyprus continues to be a matter of great concern to all o£ us. The people of this island still remain a sharply divided nation and the prospects for unity and national reconciliation seem to be as dim as ever. We therefore wish to urge the two Cypriot communities to do everything in their power to bury their differences and to find a peaceful formula for bringing about an early settlement of this long-standing question.We encourage the Secretary-General to continue to use his good offices to promote a spirit of national unity among all the people of Cyprus in order to help preserve the independence and sovereignty of their republic.With regard to the Korean peninsula  the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the recent meeting of the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas  and hopes that all existing obstacles in the way of a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula will soon be removed. Swaziland is convinced that the key to solution of the Korean problem lies in the concerted support of the international community for a process of direct inter-Korean negotiations without any external interference. We accordingly welcome the recent decision by the Government of the United States to scale down its military forces in South Korea. The protection of our environment deserves to be given the highest priority at a global level. The international community has constantly been warned of the enormous dangers posed by the mindless destruction of our beloved planet in the quest for national development. Danger signals are already flashing - clamouring for concerted action by the world community to curb those activities that degrade the environment. Such harmful practices as the indiscriminate dumping of toxic wastes and other hazardous materials must be combated at all costs. Uncontrolled deforestation  the widespread burning of grass and over-grassing are but some of the factors that have turned large tracts of originally green land into barren deserts.Swaziland wishes to reaffirm its full support for all international efforts to ensure effective protection of our environmental heritage.Although we happily welcome the developing rapprochement between the super-Powers  we are none the less painfully aware of the fact that the world is still far from achieving its ultimate goal of global disarmament.The arms race has not yet ended; many weapons of all kinds are still being produced and stockpiled. The number of nations seeking to acquire the capability to produce and stockpile weapons of mass destruction  such as chemical weapons  is increasing by the day. In the light of this continuing arms race  my delegation is convinced that the United Nations still has a very important role to play in championing the cause of disarmament. The United Nations is a unique international forum  where all nations  large and small  may continue to make an effective contribution to the task of promoting the process of disarmament.The international economic situation remains a matter of great concern to most developing nations. Four years after the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was launched  our economic situation continues to worsen. Most developing nations  like mine  depend  for their export earnings  mainly upon a very narrow range of primary commodities  with the result that the generally low commodity prices currently prevailing in the world markets play havoc with our economies. This is further aggravated by the high cost of imported spare parts and other items that are needed for economic development.At the same time  interest rates on international loans are high. This  coupled with the present unfavourable exchange rates  causes severe balance-of-payments difficulties and chronic shortages of foreign currency in the developing countries.Added to these factors is the external debt burden  which  as well as proving increasingly to be one of the major obstacles to the economic growth of our countries  is giving rise to a net transfer of real-development resources from the poor nations of the South to the industrial nations of the North.In the light of this fact  the current Gulf crisis could not have come at a worse time for the majority of non-Oil-producing developing nations. We all know how the disruption of oil production in Gulf countries has affected world oil prices. The effects are felt more sharply by those countries  such as my own  whose fragile economies are least able to cope with them. Developing countries now face the prospect of devoting larger amounts of scarce foreign currency to payment of the correspondingly higher prices of oil imports. Development projects  vital to our future  will consequently be jeopardised through lack of funds. The inevitable rise in inflation rates will surely affect the very fabric of our socio-economic structures.Employment - already an ISSUE of growing concern to the Governments of all developing nations - will be severely affected. Employers  in an effort to stave off the effects o£ escalating inflation  will be forced into staff reductions to maintain profitability. Further effects of inflation - such as rising food prices  increased production costs  and an overall deterioration in the quality of life - will clearly lead to political disaffection  with results that are potentially disastrous for governments and people in the developing world.But I am confident that this catalogue of potential woe can be averted - it must be averted - by an increase in the level of assistance to developing countries from the industrialised nations. We know that our plight is recognized  and we are reassured by the words of the representatives of wealthier countries  who use forums such as this Assembly to pledge their assistance. We look forward to seeing those words backed up by continued  and increased  action.We are not simply looking for financial handouts. The future of countries such as Swaziland depends on the development of the industrial and business sectors to such a degree that we may be able  in the shortest possible time  to dictate our own economic growth. Swazis are a proud  confident and able people. We stand ready  with the right help  to face the nest decade with optimism and hope.So  may I conclude by relaying the good wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Queen Mother and the whole Swazi nation to all the Members of this Assembly. We Swazis are indeed proud to be associated with an Organization whose influence on peace and the maintenance of stability throughout the world is being put fully to the past  an Organization that has shown that the confidence we all place in its abilities has not yet been misplaced."
"135",6608,"SYC",45,1990,"May I extend to the President the warmest congratulations of Seychelles on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We also extend our congratulations to his predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  for the competent way in which he directed the work of the forty-fourth session.I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the efforts he has made in the cause of peace and security the world over. We wish to assure him of our support in meeting his difficult responsibilities. At a time when we are preparing to celebrate the forty-fifth anniversary of our Organization  it is appropriate to recall  in these grave times  the circumstances that led to its establishment - the Second World War  an unprecedented disaster. It was at that time that nations traumatized by that deadly war resolved to preserve future generations from the scourge of war by bequeathing us the United Nations Charter. The San Francisco Charter  in its immutable principles  remains today the best guarantor of peace and our collective security. Of course  we have not always been able to have those principles respected. But the climate of detente  dialogue and co-operation that prevailed just a few weeks ago gave use a glimpse of the possibility of a better world in which each would have his role. Unfortunately  recent events in the Gulf have darkened the horizon. Once again  the use of force has prevailed. The invasion and occupation of Kuwait constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and of the sovereignty of a State. Through that violation  the entire international community has been flouted. This situation constitutes a total rejection of the duties and obligations of a State respectful of international law.Nothing can justify the innovation an annexation of Kuwait by Iraq. That act is a part of outdated political thinking and we are duty-bound forcefully to condemn any violation of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States wherever such a violation occurs. Therefore  and in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter  the Seychelles demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the restoration of the sovereignty of that State. We call upon the United Nations  the Arab League and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to redouble their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that has pitted Iraq against Kuwait. The current crisis is all the more disturbing since it involves conflicts of interests that are not always justified. We all know that the innovation of Kuwait is unfortunately not an isolated case. It is one link in a chain of confrontations and military acts of aggression that have been unleashed whenever there is a desire to see so-called moral principles or national interests prevail. None the less  if the events of the relatively recent past are there to remind us that acts of force cannot prevail over the principle of State sovereignty  it is our duty to find a peaceful solution together to every specific situation of conflict. More than ever before  the international community must remain watchful in order to prevent such an eventuality. It is a moral and undoubtedly financial task for all of us. But it is more particularly up to the major Powers to protect the small States. Unfortunately  very few of us have the means to see to it that law and morality prevail beyond our borders  much less to ensure our own national security. It is clear that here was a widespread reaction in favor of Kuwait only because the events  consequences and steaks concern the entire world. But it would be extremely desirable to ensure that the mobilization mechanism came into play whenever a State finds itself subject to an act of aggression. On the other hand  if the major Powers have deterrent force  it is equally true that in no case should they fact without a mandate from the United Nations. The sad plight of Kuwait may to some extent be a result of the unbridled arms race on the part of the big Powers  in particular in the Middle East. Although it may be reassuring to note that that is no longer the case  we hope that the current crisis will not call into question  either in the medium or the long term  the current policy of disarmament. As regards the crisis itself  we can certainly hope that hose same big Powers will preserve us from a disastrous conflict. The situation in the Gulf not only has taken pride of place over other problems but has also accentuated them. i have i mind in particular the Indian Ocean. For some years now the Republic of the Seychelles has been incessantly calling for the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  security and international co-operation. If the thaw in relations between the big Powers has undoubtedly contributed to changing the situation of tension  the Indian Ocean region remains the subject of the greed of others. That phenomenon can only widen  since the present situation in the Gulf could serve as a pretext for any party to be present militarily in our waters. How far we suddenly are - and yet how near - to the attainment of the objectives sought at the time General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) was adopted. Are we to believe that there is now no hope at all for the International Conference on the Indian Ocean? We do not believe that to be the case  and that is why today we  the countries of the Indian Ocean  renew our appeal to those who hold power and authority. We ask them to assume their responsibilities so that the colombo Conference  so long awaited  can take place.We must recognize non the less that in spite of certain setbacks there has been some progress in the global political situation. But there are still many areas which have been highlighted by the Gulf crisis and which call for action. I have in mind the threat of nuclear weapons  the problem of toxic waste  and chemical weapons. Viewed from the angle of this sword of Damocles - compounded by the present and future financial crisis - the preservation of the environment and the problem of debt and development are products of what I shall call and “infernal dialectic”.It is first and foremost up to the developing countries  of course  to implement genuine programs aimed at improving the management of their environment. In the Seychelles the new national plan launched in June 1990 constitutes a renewal and strengthening of our commitment to the concept of lasting development based on ecological considerations. It should not be forgotten that our heritage is not only of national interest but also of global interest. It is proper to recall that 42 per cent of Seychelles territory is classified as a natural preserve. Our concerns in that respect are well justified. We can even say that our environment is our primary expert product. Our two main industries  tourism and fishing  depend on it entirely. The very future of our country is at stake. None the less  in spite of all our goodwill  the challenge that the environment poses cannot be met on an individual basis. In that spirit  we are in favor of a concerted and multilateral approach in the guest for lasting and effective solutions to urgent problems. Resolute support on the part of the international community in the form of additional resources is absolutely necessary. This presupposes a redoubling of efforts on the part of the industrialized countries  and the shouldering of joint responsibilities that can supplement the programs and measures taken for the environment by the developing countries. In this interdependent world the environment can thus become a privileged focal point for international co-operation.  Of course  the International Conference on the Environment to be held in 1992 should be the opportunity to agree upon a global plan of action and practical measures for the protection of the environment at the dawning of the new century. My country is pleased that that Conference will be convened in the near future. We shall be participating actively in the conference within our means. None the less  we cannot expect magical solutions from the Conference. Furthermore  time is of the essence. The year 1992 may seem a distant date for those for whom the environment is a question of survival. That is why the efforts of those countries that are implementing real programs to preserve their environment must be supported. The initiatives of buying back part of the debt of a country in return for the implementation of conservation programs is an innovative approach which deserves to be put into practice more often. None the less  we believe that in practice it has proven to be somewhat discriminatory  since thus far only certain countries have been able to benefit from this measure. In future all countries showing their resole to preserve nature should be able to benefit from such stimulatory measures. Regardless of the solution adopted  a solution must be found because the future of our planet depends upon it. With respect to the international economic situation  no one is really inclined towards optimism. The economic situation of Africa and of the developing countries in general is today of greater concern that ever before. We must note that while there have been certain signs of economic recovery in some third-world countries  in many others living standards have declined dramatically. The per capita gross national product has declined sharply because of an increase in debt repayments amounting to over one quarter of the total export income. Third-world countries today are on the brink of bankruptcy and of the most serious recession ever experienced. The crisis in the Gulf  with all its consequences  can only further aggravate an already disastrous situation. For many countries the crisis in the Gulf means that the initial development achievements that had been registered have come to naught. Not only have their needs for foreign currency to repay their debts and import oil considerably increased  but assistance will become more scarce and more expansive. Certain donor countries have already announced budgetary restrictions and aid reductions. This means that regardless of the outcome of the current crisis a process of deterioration is now already under way  no matter how quickly the conflict is resolved. It is therefore more apparent than ever before that only a more constructive vision of the international economic order will enable us to design possible solutions. It seems to me that this is now the overriding role of the United Nations  whose primary objective remains the construction of a more united world.New struggles require our commitment: the poverty of millions of human beings; our threatened environment; the appearance of new flash points of tension. But these are not insurmountable challenges. They require a renewal of our faith in dialogue and a new climate of co-operation and harmonization. We hope that this session of the General Assembly will bring new momentum towards a more secure future and that it will contribute to relaunching a dialogue  establishing peace and creating a climate conducive to development  which has been so gravely threatened.

"136",6649,"SYR",45,1990,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly  particularly as your country  Malta  and mine  Syria  enjoy age-old cultural and historical ties for both countries belong to the Mediterranean area.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the achievement of your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  in successfully guiding the work of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. May we wish his friendly country  Nigeria  progress and prosperity.We warmly welcome the independence of Namibia and its joining of the international community. Namibia now stands with the peoples of the world in support of their just causes. We also welcome the membership of Liechtenstein in our international Organisation. It also gives roe great pleasure to express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  our appreciation of the valuable efforts he continues to make towards the establishment of peace and stability in the world and the consolidation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.Over the last few years and in the course of this year in particular  the world has witnessed major  swift and profound events and transformations whose effects are not limited to the current phase of international relations but will have an impact on the future of humanity as a whole.We may agree or disagree in assessing the consequences of those current events and transformations particularly in the long term. However  it is now certain that the cold war is over and that a number of countries which until recently used to be classified as of the ""Socialist bloc"" have opted for a new approach. I& a few hours' time  a united Germany will emerge. As recently as last year  any talk of a united Germany was taboo. In brief  we could say that the world order brought about by the Second World War has now collapsed and a new world order is beginning to emerge with the disappearance of the cold war  the fading of the spirit of animosity between East and West and the launching of a new phase of understanding and co-operation. With the end of the cold war and the collapse of the old world order  it was only natural that a spirit of optimism should prevail  especially that the great majority of developing countries had been unable to participate in that collapsed old order  because at that time they were either under colonial rule or under the protection of a colonial Power. None the less  the developing countries of the South still face difficult tasks if they are to play their natural role in shaping the new world order and  thereby  become more capable of protecting their independence and achieving prosperity for their peoples free from all forms of dependency and hegemony.The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was the first serious test of the ability of the new world order to survive. That is why the Security Council did not have many alternatives; hence  its prompt and strong reaction to the invasion  not only to save Kuwait as an independent State Member of the United Nations  but  first and foremost  to save the policy of international détente and the new world order from collapse. That explains the totally unprecedented international consensus  in condemning aggression and calling for the unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restitution of Kuwait's legitimate Government.Apart from its belief in those concepts and its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and the Security Council resolutions  Syria  as an Arab country  is duty-bound under the Charter of the Arab League and the Joint Arab Defence Pact to help any Arab country which falls victim to aggression. Furthermore  in accordance with the principles it has always followed in its Arab policy  Syria considers the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to have caused grave damage to the people of Iraq itself  because it has put them in a dead end - to say the least. The invasion has harmed the Arab nation as a whole  for it has aggravated the weakness of that nation  divided its ranks and undermined its prestige. It has also harmed the Palestinian cause  since the concern of most Arab and other friendly countries about that cause has diminished.The invasion of Kuwait  with all its attendant horror and the fear it instilled in the heart of every Arab citizen in the Gulf  has provided the reason which made the presence of foreign troops necessary as a means of protecting Arabs from fellow Arabs  something that could not have never been imagined.It is evident that ending the foreign presence in the region - which Syria seeks - could be accomplished through serious efforts to bring about this unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restitution of Kuwait's legitimate Government.Hiding behind slogans about Islam  Pan-Arabism and the distribution of oil wealth will neither deceive the people of Iraq  nor reduce the magnitude of their sufferings. Arabs and Muslims know full well that Islamic Iran was attacked in the name of Pan-Arabism and that Arab Kuwait was attached and occupied under the slogan of Islam and Jihad. Although Iraq is one of the richest oil States  the entire Arab wealth will not be sufficient to meet the cost of its irresponsible policies The policy of aggression and occupation and the annexation of the lands of others by force has always been rejected and denounced by the international community. United Nations resolutions condemning the Israeli occupation of Arab lands and calling for Israel's full withdrawal from those lands are reiterated every year in this international forum and others. Yet the cold war and the rivalry between East and Hest tended to enfeeble the effectiveness of United Nations resolutions and in one way or another allowed the aggressor to maintain its occupation and reap the fruits of its aggression. But now that the cold war between East and West has ended and relations between then have witnessed a transition from rivalry and confrontation to co-operation and partnership  and with the emergence on the horizon of a new world order  which the world community is anxious to tend and nourish  all occupation  annexation and the acquisition of the lands of others by force must come to an end; the aggressor should no longer reap the fruits of its aggression.It is truly a strange paradox that Israel  which claims to desire peace  should reject a conference for peace in the Middle East. The international community has been calling for such a conference  under United Nations auspices  for the last decade. It is yet another strange paradox that Israel  which claims that the problem in the region is the non-existence of peace accords between itself and Arab countries  does not acknowledge that the real problem lies in its occupation of Arab lands. Peace cannot be achieved without Israel's full withdrawal from those lands. Peace and occupation has never coexisted under the same roof at any time in history.Syria  which has not hesitated to condemn the occupation and annexation of an Arab country by another  expects the world  in the new international climate  to stand firm against the Israeli occupation of Arab lands. We believe that the statement issued by the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Security Council on 28 September 1990  which calls for finding a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 333 (1973)  is an important step in the right direction. The rejection of occupation and annexation is a principle that must be respected and applied in all cases  irrespective of who the occupier night fee or where the occupied territories might lie  for such a principle must be at the core of the new world order. Now that the Taif Agreement - which has Arab and international support - has become a national charter and a new constitution for Lebanon  the Lebanese crisis has come closer than ever before to a final solution. On the face of its belief in the unity of Lebanon and the necessity of safeguarding its security  stability and independence  Syria is committed to supporting Lebanese legitimacy and to helping it implement the measures necessary to extend the authority of the Lebanese Stat· over the entire territory. This requires the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) which demands the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Lebanese territory.Syria  which enjoys ties of historic friendship with Cyprus  supports the United Nations efforts to settle the current dispute in the island  on the basis of United Nations resolutions in order to safeguard the unity of the country  its non-alignment and the interests of all its citizens.As for the situation in Afghanistan  we deem it necessary to ensure full commitment to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and to reaffirm the sovereignty of Afghanistan  its independence  its non-alignment and the right of the Afghani people to choose their own Government without outside interference.As for the situation in Korea  Syria welcomes the current negotiations between the two Koreas and supports the efforts being made for their unification and for their joining the United Nations.The progress that has been achieved in Africa in the area of independence and liberation will remain incomplete unless the apartheid regime is eradicated in South Africa. We reaffirm that it is necessary to implement the Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa  adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session.Syria once again welcomes the release of the African leader Mr. Nelson Mandela  and salutes his honourable stance in defence of the rights of his people and his unwavering resistance to the apartheid regime. The peoples of the world who long for a more just  secure and prosperous future look to the world Organisation with great hopes - hopes for solutions to chronic problems that can be resolved only through international efforts and solidarity. In the context of this new world order the United Nations will assume - indeed it already has begun to assume - an important role and position that has never been witnessed since its inception. This is a new chapter in the history of our world Organisation. Let us declare our solidarity and political will; let us write a new chapter of the best that mankind longs for everywhere."
"137",6694,"TCD",45,1990,"﻿The forty-fifth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very special time in the history of the United Nations and of mankind. For the first time in more than two generations  the arms race between the major Powers seems  at last  to have ended  thus paving the way  as we all hope  to the understanding and co-operation  that all nations desire.Thus  Mr. Guido de Marco has succeeded General Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria as President of the General Assembly in circumstances that are very special and filled with great promise. The delegation of Chad offers him its warmest congratulations and wishes him and the other officers of the Assembly every success.I wish also to extend the Chadian Government's friendly greetings and warmest congratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organisation. We commend him for his dedication to the cause of peace and his tireless efforts to assist the peoples of the third world in combating destitution and poverty. Impelled by his energy and leadership  the United Nations successfully brought independence to Namibia  and  thanks to the concerted effort of the Members of the Organization.Nelson Mandela  a hero of the struggle for dignity and equality in South Africa  is again free. As we welcome the presence of the sister nation of Namibia in the General Assembly  we venture to hope that we will soon see a multiracial delegation of South Africa occupying that country's seat in this Hall.My delegation also congratulates the Principality of Liechtenstein on its admission to the Organisation as its 160th Member.At the forty-fourth session  we saw the first signs of the end of the cold war. Throughout Central and Eastern Europe political liberalisation has in a few months transformed relationships which had been frozen and seemed immutable for the past 40 years. The signals we got from the Malta Summit on 3 and 4 December 1989 were forerunners of the end of one period - the cold war - and the beginning of another  a period of dialogue and concerted action. Since then the words ""peace""  ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" have become our leitmotiv  the concepts driving the actions of the world.Chad  for its part  did not wait for the East wind to blow over the rest of the world before embarking upon political changes. In fact  as early as 7 June 1982 the Government of the Third Republic began to lay the bases for genuine democracy in the country. It did so first by calling on the Chadian people for national reconciliation after the tragedies that had beset the country. Then  in 1987  it expelled the foreign occupation forces from the northern half of the country. And  finally  it set up in July 1088 the Constitutional Committee that produced the Constitution adopted by referendum on 10 December 1989. That referendum was also the process used to elect the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Al-Hadj Hussein Habre  for a term of seven years.The new Constitution  which was a genuine product of the Chadian people and was adopted by a large majority vote of our people  today governs the public life of the country. Its provisions embody the universal principles of democracy and freedom  and thus the rights and duties of citizens - in other words  human rights. The institutions provided for under the new Constitution are beginning to come into being. Thus  on 8 July 1990 the Chadian electorate went to the polls to fill the 123 seats in the National Assembly. For the first time in the history of independent Chad  the voters were free to choose their representatives from among 436 candidates who were standing for election on an individual basis. The elections took place in a calm atmosphere  attesting to the political maturity which was acquired by the Chadian people during the long years of a war of aggression and was bolstered by national feeling forged by its suffering.If political freedom is to bear fruit  it must go hand in hand with harmonious economic development. For that reason  as it seeks to bring about democratization in ways that take into account Chadian cultural values  the Government of the Republic of Chad has committed itself to a programme for the reconstruction and development of the country. Unfortunately  however  apart from the problems of war  the other scourges which Chad had to endure for years have once against raised their heads. I am referring specifically to drought and the pests that destroy crops and vegetation.Chad  together with the rest of the Sahelian region  has suffered from a shortage of rainfall in 1990  reminiscent of the worst years of drought  famine and desertification. The current year will be one of the most disastrous for farming and the Chadian people already can hear famine knocking at their door. Therefore  once again  the Government of the Third Republic has the regrettable duty to make a pressing appeal to the international community  to all donor countries and agencies  to provide food assistance as promptly as possible to the neediest sectors of the Chadian population. As in the past  the Government of Chad will undertake to distribute that assistance to the beneficiaries in the most open fashion. Dependent as it is on one crop - cotton - Chad continues to suffer from the crisis that affected that sector in 1986. The very slight hardening of cotton prices in recent years has made the gradual reorganisation of that sector possible  but at the same time Chad is trying to find other means of offsetting the budgetary losses occasioned by the restructuring.With the primary objective of eradicating hunger and poverty in Chad  the Government of the Third Republic has made rural development the country's priority. This will involve improved health  a higher level of literacy and  above all  the mastering of agricultural research techniques in order to adapt the various crops to the country's climatic conditions and thus maximize the productivity. But  regrettably  the uncertainty of the climate has frustrated our efforts.As the same time  the choice of this priority in no way represents neglect of the other sectors of the economy  which are equally important and to which we are paying great attention. But for a Sahilian country such as ours  assailed by drought and desertification  the assuring of our food supply becomes a daily concern that haunts us. In this respect  the substantial underground water reserves in Chad could be drawn upon through an irrigation programme in the arid and semi-arid areas of the country.Contributions from friendly countries and international development agencies and organisations to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Chad  together with the massive participation of the major donors at the round-table on Chadian development  from 18 to 20 June 1990  lead us to hope that our struggle for food security will receive increasing support from our partners.Similarly  the conference on education and employment to be held at the end of the year as part of our sectoral approach to development in Chad would be especially successful if our major partners were to take an active part. As we once again earnestly appeal to our donors to continue to lend us their invaluable support  we also wish to express to them the gratitude and appreciation of the Government and people of Chad. Our thanks go in particular to the Governments of France  the Federal Republic of Germany  Italy  the United States  the Netherlands  Switzerland  China  Saudi Arabia and many others that it would not be possible to name here  and also to development agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the World Bank and the European Economic Community (EEC) through the European Development Fund.We would also like to pay a special tribute to those officials of UNDP who assisted us in preparing for the Geneva round-table as well as to France and the World Bank for their assistance in the preparations for the conference on education and employment.Reconstruction and development in a country such as Chad represent a long-term undertaking. Mindful as we are of this fact  we are striving to rely  first and foremost  on ourselves  but  given our limited resources  we are also obliged to rely on the assistance of the international community as a whole if we are to achieve our objectives. In this regard  we are again this year submitting to the General Assembly a draft resolution on special assistance to Chad. We are confident that delegations will once again support this text as they have done in the last few years.As we have always stressed  peace is a prerequisite of any economic and social progress. Chad has legitimate aspirations to peace while in no way neglecting the need to defend its territorial integrity and the dignity of its people. Open as we are to dialogue and co-operation  Chad is firmly resolved to live in peace with all its neighbours  without distinction. In that spirit  the Government of the Third Republic has professed its faith in the sound nature of the Chadian spirit  which is once of tolerance and hospitality. Unfortunately  this openness of spirit seems to have been regarded by certain neighbouring countries as weakness  to such a point that  at a certain moment in its history  Chad found itself almost entirely occupied and laid waste with its very existence as a State flouted.The national uprising which ended that situation has also restored dignity to the Chadian people. Today  the people of Chad are united in locking towards the future  resolved to make their country a great nation.It is in this perspective that we see the bilateral dialogue and the dialogue taking place in the ad hoc committee of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) concerning the Chad-Libya dispute which led to the cease-fire in September 1987 and to the signing of the Framework Agreement o¿ Algiers on 31 August 1989 concerning the peaceful settlement of the territorial dispute between the two countries.In this respect  even though conciliation has not led to the desired results  the Algiers Agreement has been respected by the two parties to the conflict as far as the ruling of the International Court of Justice is concerned.Given the nature of the jurisprudence and the norms of international law in this area  together with the fact that the OAU has made uti possedetis the linchpin of the principle of the sacredness of the ^orders inherited from colonisation  Chad continues to have confidence in the future rulings of the Court. Chad has confidence in the United Nations bodies and agencies in their role as organs responsible for safeguarding peace and security and preserving the sovereignty of small vulnerable nations. Respect for the norms and principles of international law should henceforth govern relations among States at a time when the major actors in international life are demonstrating their faith in the United Nations system in а very concrete manner.Hope is being reborn in the hearts of billions of men and women who have always desired - seemingly in vain - an end to the cold war and to regional conflicts and longed for the dawning of greater justice in international relations. How  only a few years away from the next millennium  the community of nations must welcome the changes in Eastern Europe which have suddenly relaxed the atmosphere to such an extent that it is now possible to hope that a nuclear war may be averted and that there are greater chances of ending regional conflicts.The positive developments in South Africa  the independence of Namibia  the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan are all  in this respect  palpable proof  and indeed logical consequences  of East-West detente. At the same time  the democratisation of Central and Eastern Europe lead the people of that continent to hope for the realisation in the near future of the Common European Home. But the fires of tension are by no means completely extinguished. In Asia  in Latin America  in Africa and in the Middle East  especially in the Gulf region  tensions persist and new ones arise. Bloody confrontations pose a dangerous threat to peace and security in those regions and throughout the world.Everyone knows that the present Gulf crisis greatly transcends the boundaries of the States directly involved  going beyond the Middle East itself. It is a real time-bomb threatening the whole of mankind. It is clear that a military conflagration would destroy the entire region. While no one knows when or how it might be ended  it is certain that it would take an unacceptable number of innocent lives and would cause lasting disruption to economic and political life world-wide. Therefore  Chad joins the rest of the international Community in calling for a rapid peaceful settlement to this dangerous conflict. It goes without saying that  to be viable  such a settlement must take account of the interests and concerns of all parties; it is also clear that no peaceful solution will be possible unless it is rooted in the legal and political norms and principles that are the foundation of international political life. In other words  it must have its basis in respect for international law  respect for the United Nations Charter and respect for the various resolutions adopted by the United Nations on this subject.Aware of our own country's recent past  my delegation joins previous speakers in urgently appealing to the international community to do everything in its power to find peaceful solutions to all these conflicts. The present climate in international relations more than ever before favours positive co-operation to that end. We encourage the Secretary-General in his peace initiatives designed to ensure that understanding and concord prevail throughout the world. The universal peace to which we have aspired since the creation of the United Nations is within our grasp  and can be achieved if we bring the necessary means to bear. Future generations will judge us very harshly if we fail to grasp this unique opportunity to restore peace throughout the world. That peace must be just  lasting and comprehensive. It must take into account the dignity of all peoples and bring greater justice to relations among States.While we cannot but welcome the independence of Namibia  apartheid continues to rear its ugly head in neighbouring South Africa  despite the talks under way between Pretoria and the African National Congress of South Africa. The evil minds that created that political system have even generated inter-tribal differences in order to delay further the elimination of racial discrimination.Above all  justice must be manifested in international economic relations  where the inequality is most striking. The international economic situation seems to be far from benefiting from the improvements of recent years. Although growth ha  continued in developed market-economy countries  the countries of Latin America and Africa suffer from stagnation or even regression.The causes of this deterioration were identified long ago and are well known. In particular  we note the content major fall in commodity prices  the net transfer of resources to developed countries  the enormous debt burden and skyrocketing interest rates.Over the past 30 years there has been no lack of United Nations initiatives designed to find overall solutions to the great challenges of the day: poverty  famine  ignorance and disease. The magnitude of these scourges cries out to the conscience of all  and the developing countries feel increasingly that everything is being done to delay the inevitable day o£ reckoning.Africa  a continent on the way to being marginalised  is facing a real disaster  and nothing in the short term gives us hope that the trend will be reversed. Moreover  the blame for the crisis in the continent is being placed on the Africans themselves. As President Al-Haj Hissein Habre has said ""A ferocious media campaign is now trying to show that problems of underdevelopment are due to come congenital lack of ability on the part of the Africans"".Poverty  exacerbated by policies of structural adjustment with a high social cost  is spreading  and threatens peace in many countries.As I say  there has been no lack of initiatives  and the United Nations has a fundamental role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security as well as in the promotion of development. That is why the Declaration on economic co-operation adopted at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly and the Paris Declaration on the Least Developed Countries  despite their scope  should be seen as important challenges for this final decade of the century.The crucial problems confronting the developing countries and the least developed among them in particular can be solved only if accepted principles and objectives are applied in a comprehensive and integrated manner. In the final analysis  genuine international co-operation for development requires the political will of States  buttressed by a spirit of equity and  above all  a sense of justice. Without justice  North-South antagonisms could grow worse. The end of the cold war and of the arms race should provide an opportunity for all mankind to turn in the same direction and to direct its creative forces towards the development of the third world  the eradication of poverty  and scientific progress for the common good.While democracy and human rights are central questions in development  what do human rights and individual freedoms mean to starving people huddled together in destitution and ignorance? Lags in various areas of development resulting from an unjust economic order are the basic causes of underdevelopment. Countries will not emerge from their situation by creating anarchy in over-indebted countries whose people live below the poverty line. To have some chance of success political liberalisation must be sustained and promoted by integrated economic development.Similarly  the protection of the environment must not be achieved at the expense of the countries of the third world in general and Africa in particular. Nor must it be a pretext for unreasonable delay in carrying out development projects initiated by underdeveloped countries.It goes without saying that for a Sahelian country like Chad  with so fragile an environment  protecting the ecosystem is of special importance to us as we formulate our development policies. If we are to push back the desert and conquer it  we need everyone's assistance. This session of the Assembly has seen the convening of the first florid Summit for Children. That unique event was an extraordinary hymn to hope and to mankind's future. The world awareness evidenced at that meeting with regard to the nature of the tragic sufferings of the planet's children and to the remedies needed is proof in itself of the resolve of nations and their leaders to meet all the challenges that endanger the cowing generations. Chad takes this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to asking its modest contribution to the building of a world finally free from poverty  exploitation  racism  oppression and war  a world in which peace  freedom  justice  mutual understanding and material and spiritual well-being will prevail."
"138",6740,"TGO",45,1990,"﻿In recent months the world has been stirred by uplifting events that give us grounds for believing that mankind has at last - and once and for all - entered a new era of detente and understanding. It seems that the coming together of East and Nest has ushered in a new order in which relations between nations will conform to a pattern of peace and co-operation. Nails have come down borders have been opened and peoples have been reunited and together are building a shared future. The entire community of peoples has good reason to welcome this decisive development. It must also accept the fact that the certainties born of recent events nay prove fragile and fleeting in the face of the dangers now mounting again and threatening the peace. Indeed  if we do not manage to prevent war and ease the suffering of the world's peoples  the technical achievements on which our century prides itself so much will be vain achievements  meaning that they are of no real use for our collective survival.Before I continue  I should like to offer the President my own congratulations and those of the Togolese delegation on the election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. His thorough knowledge of the issues with concern us and the constructive role his country plays in maintaining the peace both augur well for a successful outcome to our work.In guiding the work of the forty-fourth session and the special session of the General Assembly on drugs  on apartheid and on international economic co-operation  his predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria  carried out his task effectively and usefully  thanks to his highly developed sense of tact  his energy and his commitment. My delegation wishes to honour him as he deserves  in keeping with his outstanding talents.We also wish to congratulate and thank the Secretary-General for the energetic way in which  with that calm  unshakeable confidence we so admire  he discharges his weighty responsibilities in the service of peace. Thanks to his determination and devotion  our Organisation has had some remarkable successes and has regained the prestige and effectiveness it needs for its mission.Likewise  we warmly welcome the Principality of Liechtenstein  whose admission to the United Nations enlarges the family circle and reinforces the universality of the Organization. The progressive improvement in East-West relations can be seen today as a determining factor in the effort to establish a new world equilibrium. It has made possible a successful conclusion of the efforts to achieve reunification of the two Germany  a historic example of the recognition of the right of peoples to self-determination.We pay a tribute to Germany  a country which has many ties of friendship and co-operation with my own  in the conviction that Germany must and will enhance the peace  stability and prosperity of the new Europe.The continuing efforts of the two greatest Powers towards chemical and nuclear disarmament and the intensive negotiations within the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to achieve a balanced reduction of conventional forces in Europe and to develop confidence-building measures are undoubtedly essential factors helping to consolidate international peace and security. Also of great significance are the recent efforts to transform the two main military alliances  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (HATO) and the Warsaw Pact  into instruments for dialogue and co-ordination today and for political co-operation tomorrow.The movements for freedom and democracy arising in our societies are clear signs of a general realisation that some development models and policies are bankrupt. This change must be organised and adapted to suit our needs and our real capabilities the legitimate guest for freedom and democracy has become urgent everywhere  but it should not jeopardise the social cohesion and national unity of our countries. It is up to each nation  within the contest of the internationally recognised requirements  to define the ways to ensure internal peace while participating in the effort to bring world peace. By this I mean that building societies which are more democratic and which better respect fundamental human rights and freedoms should start not from the simple copying of foreign models but front the historical and socio-cultural realities of each State that is to say the special genius of each people. As the President of Togo General Gnassingbe Eyadema so rightly noted in his speech of 20 June at the sixteenth Franco-African summit at La Baule  Frances""We must keep in mind that no one can go against the will of the people  who are the sole custodians of power and on whom it is not possible  without risking failure  to impose a political system which runs counter to their deepest aspirations. For if any political option is to be viable and potentially successful  it must be grounded in the realities of each society and be integrated into the normal historical evolution of each country"". The end of the ideological confrontation between the great Powers does not signify by any means that peace has been achieved once and for all throughout the world. There are  any hotbeds of tension still persisting everywhere.In Liberia  in the very heart of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOHAS)  a tragedy which causes great concern to all is taking place. My country  for its part  has urged the belligerents to exercise the greatest possible restraint  and  in a moving appeal delivered on 23 August  called on then to agree to an early cease-fire  at the same tine proposing that a special summit of ECOHAS should be called with a view to promoting a peaceful and lasting settlement to this fratricidal conflict and bringing about reconciliation of all of that country's sons.The conflict in Western Sahara has been moving towards a fair and lasting settlement since both parties accepted the settlement plan put forward on 30 August 1988 by the Secretary-General. In this respect  the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front must continue to co-operate closely with the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) with a view to establishing an effective cease-fire and holding the self-determination referendum.The positive developments in the situation in South Africa are to some extent the result of the historic consensus reached by the international community at the sixteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the subject of Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa. The Declaration adopted by that important session embodies the categorical and unanimous rejection of apartheid and highlights the urgency of eradicating it once and for all.Togo acclaims the far-sightedness and sense of responsibility of the decision by the African National Congress (ANC) to suspend the armed struggle. It also urges President De Klerk to take this historic opportunity to create conditions favouring a wide-ranging dialogue among all elements of South African society with a view to demolishing the apartheid system quickly and creating a democratic  non-racial society. If such conditions are to obtain  they must necessarily be preceded by the freeing of all political detainees and by an end to the violence blacks are suffering on a daily basis.The accession of Namibia to independence and its admission to the United Nations were signs of the times showing once again that the United Nations had regained its prestige and effectiveness. That is why it is fitting to pay a particular tribute to the men and women who  by their courage  devotion and competence  made it possible for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) to carry out its difficult mission successfully. Togo considers it an honour to have taken part in that mission and thereby demonstrated that it subscribes completely to the noble values and objectives which guide our Organisation. The involvement of the United Nations in settling the crisis in Central America is  to a great extent  the explanation for the progress made in applying the peace plan drawn up by the leaders of the region.In the Gulf the international community is today confronted by serious breaches of the rules and principles on which the Charter is founded. The invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq constitute an act of aggression which must be condemned  not only because it contravenes international law but above all because it could once again lend respectability to violence and force as means of settling international disputes.In adopting its resolutions on this subject  the Security Council has fully lived up to its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and has genuinely striven to ensure scrupulous respect for international law.For that reason the Government of Togo fully endorses those resolutions and urges the Iraqi Government to withdraw its troops and to end the occupation and annexation of the sovereign State of Kuwait unconditionally. We call on all States in the region and outside it to spare no efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.With regard to the foreseeable disastrous consequences of this crisis for the economies of our countries as a result of large increases in oil prices it is vital for the international community  including both States and financial institutions  to do their utmost to shield the least developed countries from new financial constraints which would frustrate their development efforts and inflict shocks with incalculable consequences on their societies.A lasting overall settlement of the Cambodian question is also an urgent task  whose accomplishment should be greatly facilitated by the improvement in East-West relations and the strengthening of confidence in the world Organisation. Recent developments on this issue clearly indicate a heightened awareness of the need to end a conflict which has brought great suffering to the Cambodian people  a people which should now be able legitimately to exorcise its right to self-determination. In Afghanistan  following the departure of foreign troops  the various parties will have to engage in negotiations in order to restore independence and unity to the Afghan people.The merger of the two Yemens and the upcoming unification of the two Germanys should impress on the conscience of the world the vital need to rectify the mistakes of history by enabling divided peoples to re-establish their cultural and political identity within a homogeneous State structure.This confirms the importance my Government attaches to the reunification of the two Koreas as a factor to promote stability in Asia and strengthen international peace and security. For that reason  my Government ardently hopes that the free-circulation experiment going on now between the two Koreas will be continued and will herald a genuine thawing in the relations between the two States.The Organisation has made tremendous efforts to end the conflict which has torn Lebanon apart for two decades. Restoration of peace to that country will require first and foremost the departure of all foreign forces  whoso presence tends to promote the state of war.In the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank the intransigent positions of the parties concerned continues to maintain a permanent atmosphere of violence. In this connection  we make a solemn appeal to all parties concerned to agree to the holding of an international conference under United Nations auspices.The stability of the world depends not only on the improvement of international political relations. It now depends even more on a fairer sharing of economic prosperity. The burden of the economic crisis by which the world has been beset for two decades is not borne equally by the wealthy and the poor countries. The confusion and disarray created by an anachronistic international economic system based  among other things  on rules that work to the exclusive advantage of the developed countries  are genuine obstacles to economic growth development in the developing countries.It is important to note here the particularly critical situation of African countries which are hit even harder than others by the imbalances of the international economic system.In order to escape from this state of profound crisis  the African countries have courageously undertaken reforms designed to establish the political and social conditions required for renewed economic growth through the use  among other things  of structural-adjustment programmes. However  their potential for success is often negated by the collapse of commodity prices and hence of export earnings  and also  most particularly  by the reduction in real terms of external financial inputs and the increasing burden of debt service.It is vital for the international community as a whole to implement the recommendations of the last United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. It must strive to create an open and fair trading system  to support the least developed countries' efforts for diversification and economic modernisation and to increase substantially the flows of financing to those countries.We must urgently resume the North-South dialogue in a joint effort to find solutions to our common problems  particularly the decline of commodity prices  since a fair return for these products is indispensable for the survival of our economies. In this connection  I appeal to all to redouble their efforts to endow the Common Fund for commodities with the means it needs in order to operate effectively. There must also be international action to apply a bold strategy to external debt  placing stress in particular on debt deferral  reduction of interest rates  extension of repayment deadlines and the granting of assistance consisting substantially of grants or interest-free loans.The actions taken by certain donor countries to lighten the debt burden of the developing countries  particularly African countries  are praiseworthy and should be encouraged. The least developed countries require increased attention and assistance  in keeping with the Programme of Action adopted by the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  hold at Paris at the beginning of this month.In this connection the intentions stated recently by the leaders of the seven most industrialized countries at Houston are particularly encouraging  and we hope that they will soon be translated into action.The grave threats to mankind inherent in the accumulation of weapons of all kinds and in the continued existence of certain hotbeds of tension are compounded by the crucial problem of the rapid deterioration of the environment. The deterioration of the ozone layer  deforestation  desertification  marine and river pollution and air pollution have particularly destructive effects the environment all share. Today climates are unstable  the earth is warming up  and specialists predict future disasters resulting from the melting of the ice-cap  which would cause catastrophic flooding in coastal regions. The same experts also foresee famines and epidemics consequent on those atmospheric disruptions.For that reason  the international community must act resolutely to prevent those evils. Togo attaches crucial importance to environmental problems and has taken measures to protect its fauna and its natural heritage. An environmental code has been adopted  and the Government is enforcing it very strictly. Working together  we have unquestionably made progress in solving some of the great issues of international life  but in order to ensure that this progress is irreversible and leads to the emergence of a world purged of fear  violence and injustice  it is essential that we should constantly strengthen our commitment to the United Nations. Nothing lasting has ever been achieved or can be built on the basis of mistrust or in an atmosphere of violence.Genuine security will be established not through deterrence but through persuasion  and the only weapon for that purpose is dialogue  a dialogue based on the ideas and fundamental aspirations we hold in common a dialogue aimed at building trust among peoples and peace among individuals. While it is true that nations are motivated only by their own interests  nevertheless today those interests are increasingly blended into one common objective  that of defending the principles we have set for ourselves  mindful of the shared destiny of peoples and individuals.Today's events demand that we should reassess the beliefs underlying those principles and the determination with which each of us pursues them and strives to ensure that they are respected. The time had come to shoulder our common responsibility in solidarity. We must refuse to be part of the conspiracy of silence and commit ourselves to struggle to protect mankind and its environment.Only thus shall we have contributed to ensuring a better future for all person and for all of mankind."
"139",6786,"THA",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of the Thai delegation  I should like to extend to you  Sir  our warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-fifth session. I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Joseph Garba  President at the forty-fourth session  for his effective leadership during the past 12 months. We are witnessing and living in a most remarkable period in world history. A new world order seems to have dawned. Until August 1990  the nations of the world were steadily moving towards accommodation  transcending the ideologies which  for most of this century  divided the peoples of the world. Since the beginning of this year  the East-West cold war appears to have ended. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the imminent reunification of Germany serve to underscore this fact. The only jarring note in this hopeful scenario occurred in the Persian Gulf. Even so  and from the vantage-point of the United Nations  there seems to have emerged an unprecedented degree of unity among nations  as evidenced by the remarkable number of resolutions adopted by the Security Council aimed at restoring peace and security in that region of the world. Thailand stands firmly with the international community in its support of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. We cannot condone the use of force in violation of the United Nations Charter and of international law anywhere in the world.The activity and the resolve of the United Nations in the Iraq-Kuwait conflict reflect  in an unprecedented fashion  a willingness on the part of the international community to allow the world body to play the role envisaged by its founders. Indeed  over the past 12 months  the nations of the world have looked to the United Nations to bring about a settlement of numerous and long-standing regional issues - in Africa  in Asia and in Central America.In North-East Asia  developments concerning the Korean peninsula continue to be very important for the question of peace and stability in that region. For this reason  the unification initiative by President Roh Tae Woo deserves serious consideration. Furthermore  we would welcome any move by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to join this Organization if they so desire  for we believe in the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations. In numerous instances  especially in recent times  the United Nations and its peace-keeping operations have proved to be indispensable as instruments of peace. For their success  the Secretary-General and his staff and  in particular  the United Nations peace-keeping forces  deserve to be commended. United Nations peace-keepers have gone beyond the role of merely separating hostile forces to include peace-making endeavours. The administration of free and fair elections by the United Nations is a very important component of this. Indeed  a number of countries have been actively exploring the possibility of utilising the United Nations in just such a manner. One country that stands to benefit is Cambodia.One of the first major policy pronouncements of the Thai Government under Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan two years ago was that of turning the battlefields of Indochina into a market-place. This is in keeping with the positive trends that have been becoming oviduct in international relations. These are the trends towards peace and accommodation. Regional conflicts are on the wane. Governments everywhere are turning their energies towards modernising their countries and enhancing the quality of life of their peoples. The same is true for most of the countries of South-East Asia  especially those in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASSAM). We are at peace  growing and prosperous. We comprise one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. An exception  however  is Cambodia. The Cambodian people continue to suffer from the war  which has lasted for more than two decades. This has to come to an end. The fighting must stop so that the Cambodians and the international community may be able to work together to restore peace and to lay the groundwork for progress and prosperity for the Cambodian people. As Cambodia’s neighbour  Thailand is in a good position to help. In February this year  Bangkok was offered as the site of a meeting between Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Mr. Hun Sen. This  I believe  facilitated the convening of the informal meeting on Cambodia in Jakarta as well as the subsequent meeting in Tokyo in June.Thailand welcomes and greatly appreciates the efforts of others who have been deeply involved. I would like to commend the Secretary-General and his able assistants for their tireless efforts. I would also like to encourage them to forge ahead with preparations for the important and enhanced role of the United Nations in the settlement of this conflict and in the transition to normalcy in Cambodia. The efforts of Australia to bridge the differences among the various parties and to bring them closer together is also instrumental in bringing us to the stage at which we are now.A very important step in the peace process for a political settlement in Cambodia has come from the five permanent members of the Security Council during these past few months. At their meeting in August  they were able to reach agreement on a framework for a comprehensive settlement. The document produced by the five permanent members was a result of skilful diplomacy  for which they should be warmly congratulated. This led to the historic informal meeting on Cambodia in Jakarta early in September under the leadership of Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia. At that meeting that document was accepted by all the Cambodian factions in its entirety. In addition  an agreement was reached on the formation of a Supreme National Council (SMC) in the interim period  pending elections under United Nations administration and supervision. This was indeed a very important breakthrough. After the conclusion of the Jakarta meeting  the Thai Government was requested to organise the first meeting of the SMC to elect its chairman and to form a Cambodian delegation to the current session of the General Assembly. Unfortunately  this attempt was not successful. However  the Thai position on the peace process in Cambodia is clear and consistent. The Thai Government hopes the SHC will commence its work without delay in consultations with the Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council  especially the five permanent members  in order to ensure that the United Nations is enabled to play an active role. Thailand reiterates its full support for the United Nations and the Secretary-General in assisting the Cambodian people and the SNC in this crucial transition leading to free and fair general elections in Cambodia.There are other urgent issues which must be addressed. Important components of the settlement process must be further elaborated before the reconvening of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia (PICC). The outstanding questions must be resolved as soon as possible so that the transition to normalcy in Cambodia will be smooth and efficacious. The Thai Government stands ready to join the other participants in the PICC whenever the Co-Chairmen - France and Indonesia - deem it appropriate to reconvene the Conference.Recent developments augur well for the Cambodian people. As a neighbour of Cambodia  Thailand will work closely with its partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations  the co-chairmen of the PICC  the five permanent members of the Security Council and all other interested countries and parties to help ensure that peace and harmony  progress and prosperity return to Cambodia very soon.Thailand's hope of seeing the transformation of the battlefields into market-places extends beyond Cambodia to all the countries of Indo-China  and also Myanmar. We believe that the successful integration of these countries  with ASEAN  into a broader regional economic system will be in our common interest. We stand ready to contribute to such integration  which we believe will enhance the economic performance of the Asia-Pacific region. The economic performance of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has been impressive. In the period from 1987 to 1989  real economic growth averaged 4.2 per cent for the members of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC)  nearly twice that of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Trade between the APEC countries constituted over half of all APEC trade. The outlook remains bright for the period 1990 to 1991. Foreign investment within the APEC region has contributed to this happy trend.Although trade between the APEC countries and economies has been dynamic  APEC is not a trading bloc. Its aim is not to compete with existing institutions. On the contrary  APEC is a reflection of the strong commitment of countries in the region to free trade and the spirit of multilateralism. It may  indeed  contribute to the ongoing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiating process and the Uruguay Round.We will have to wait and see what APEC will be able to achieve in real terms and in the long run. But I am convinced that APEC reflects greater economic interdependence among its members and reinforces it  thereby facilitating regional peace and co-operation in the spirit of the United Nations Charter.As I said at the beginning of my statement  events of the past few months have shown the United Nations to be a vital mechanism for the maintenance of international peace and security. We also know that the United Nations has been  and continues to be  an instrument that can enhance the social and economic development of our peoples. We like what we have seen  and wish to encourage the United Nations to have an ever-increasing role in these directions.In all this  the Secretary-General has emerged as a central figure. He has proven time and time again that he is a skilful and capable diplomat. His tireless efforts and his contributions to world peace have been vital. The international community owes him a vote of thanks. As for you  Mr. President  you have a long and important session of the General Assembly ahead of you. It is a great responsibility and a challenge. I have no doubt that you will excel in your task. I wish you every success."
"140",6902,"TTO",45,1990,"﻿May I on behalf of my government add our warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of this session of the General Assembly. The session takes place at another crucial juncture in human history. It is a Moment which requires strong commitment and enlightened guidance. Fortunately  these have been the hallmarks of the diplomacy of your remarkable country over the years. For that reason we are convinced that your presidency will contribute significantly to a harmonious and successful session.My delegation also pays a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria  for his exemplary leadership throughout the forty-fourth session.We extend a hearty welcome to our new Member  Liechtenstein The unexpected  unprecedented and profound changes which have occurred in the world over the past year make the beginning of the 19S08 one of the most exciting times in modern history. The most rigid political and economic systems have  overnight as it were  been radically transformed. Iron-cast barriers have been broken down. We have witnessed the passionate determination and irrepressible will of millions of people in concerted action for freedom. Super-Power competition and rivalry are being replaced by co-operation. Disengagement from authoritarian rule gathers pace globally. Finally  the prospects appear more favourable than ever for the United Nations to play the role envisaged for it in 1945 by the founding fathers.We applaud those far-reaching changes  which have altered profoundly/  and I trust irreversibly  once familiar features of the international landscape. The international community now enters confidently into the post-cold-war era. It is a time vibrant with hope and promise. It is also a time of continuing challenges and perils  as we have seen dramatically demonstrated in the current situation In the Middle East. The end of the cold war has not brought an end to attitudes  assumptions and reflexes of bygone eras. Even as arms reduction takes place in the main theatre of past East-West confrontation  arms races are intensifying in other regions  leading to the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  λ false and elusive security continues to be sought in military hardware.Yet it should be noted that the end of the post-Second-World-War dispensation in Europe - an end symbolised so dramatically just two days ago by millions in a reunited Berlin - was brought about not by force of arms but by economic development  technological progress and the democratic aspirations of peoples. Herein  I suggest  lies a lesson for the entire international community as we search for new underpinnings for stability and security and for the establishment of a new international order.Although the dramatic improvement in East-West relations and the radical changes in Eastern Europe have captured our attention  profound transformations have also taken place in other parts of the globe. It is in this context that we feel encouraged by the decision of the parties to the Cambodian dispute to sit around the negotiating table. Similarly  we are heartened by the fact that representatives of the Korean people have finally set aside mutual distrust and hostility and have taken the first  tentative steps on the road to reconciliation.Earlier this year the Assembly welcomed to its ranks an independent and sovereign Namibia after decades of struggle against oppression. In so doing the international community fulfilled a mandate dating back to the earliest years of the United Nations. With the independence of Namibia the final chapter in the history o£ colonialism in sub-Saharan Africa has nearly come to an end - a fact which must strengthen the resolve to excise for all time the cancer of apartheid.The epic struggle  heroic sacrifice and iron determination of one man. Nelson Mandela  have not gone unnoticed by the world Organisation. With his release from prison  the long dark night of apartheid began to give way to a glimmer of hope for the new dawn. The regime in Pretoria  it would appear  has at last recognised that the system of apartheid can no longer be sustained. State President De Klerk has indicated by his latest pronouncements that Pretoria may now finally be prepared to break with the past. It is  however  critical that the South African regime accelerate the process of change  and move rapidly from ""talks about talks"" to genuinely constructive dialogue with the leadership of the black majority on the key issues which would lead to the formation of a non-racial and democratic society.The disturbing issues of violence in the townships  particularly in Natal and the Transvaal  needs to be addressed urgently by both Pretoria and the black leadership. Continued violence would place in jeopardy the recent political gains made by the majority; it would derail the nascent negotiating process; it would provide a pretext for these forces opposed to a change of the status quo in that troubled country. Trinidad and Tobago wishes to reiterate  and cannot overemphasise  that in the interest of all of us this opportunity to move South Africa away from apartheid must not be squandered. The principal actors and the stage are in South Africa  but the effects of failure would be global.While encouraging the process of reconciliation and negotiation in South Africa  Trinidad and Tobago remains mindful of the need for the international community to maintain existing sanctions until meaningful and permanent change has taken place. In this context we urge those States with influence in Pretoria to intensify their efforts to persuade that regime to quicken the process of fundamental change. We welcome wholeheartedly the role of the United Nations in the assistance provided to Namibia in the conduct of free and fair elections. In this process Trinidad and Tobago fait honoured to play a part. We strongly support the proposal of the President of the United States of America for a permanent capability in the United Nations to render this kind of assistance to countries that seek it.The successful conduct of internationally monitored free and fair elections in Nicaragua  in which my own country played a part under the aegis of the Organisation of American States  bodes well for the entire region; and Trinidad and Tobago hopes that both Government and Opposition in Nicaragua will seek to establish an environment which will encourage sustained peace and development. We are truly saddened by the recent turn of events in Haiti  although the latest information seems to give some cause for optimism. Growing tensions and instability have resulted in the postponement of the registration process and possibly of the elections. We remain hopeful  however  that the schedule for the inauguration of the elected President of the Republic on 7 February 1991 will be honoured.Trinidad and Tobago continues to play its part in the effort to bring about democratic changes in Haiti. In this regard we have joined with our fellow colleagues in the Caribbean Community (CAKICOM)  with the Organisation of American States (OAS) and with other Members of the United Nations itself in ongoing efforts to achieve this objective.It is ironic that while Trinidad and Tobago  a free  open and democratic society  has been assisting in establishing the democratic process in other States  our owe democracy was recently imperilled in a most extraordinary manner.A new breed of fanatics claiming divine inspiration  but acting rather under satanic impulse  blew up our police headquarters  shot their way into our Parliament  held the Prime Minister  ministers  parliamentarians and other citizens at gunpoint  bound them hand and foot  inflicted torture  shot the Prime Minister in his leg  caused several fatalities and held all under threat of death. This small  but rash and reckless band of adventurers seized the only television station  committed and instigated sundry other acts of damage and disorder while its leader proclaimed a new government without a single intelligent clue as to what was to what done thereafter.I am sure that you  Mr. President  like our highly respected Secretary-General and all representatives in this Hall  would agree that it speaks volumes for the people of our country that we were able to overcome this peril without any external intervention. May I express  on behalf of my country  my gratitude to our CARICOM colleagues  Venezuela  other hemispheric countries and countries beyond the hemisphere which responded in the crisis to our need for food  medical and other essential supplies  and may I also express our deep gratitude for the numerous expressions of moral support that we received from all parts of the world. Trials of the offenders are now taking place  but the situation still poses a challenge to our security and legal systems.As freedom enlarges and expands and more democratic systems are established  notably in Eastern Europe  but elsewhere as well  new issues of security are certain to arise. We need to address this question of security on two fronts  it is essential that there be the fullest possible collaboration among States at regional and international levels in the investigation  prosecution and elimination of serious crimes. Events such as I have described as occurring in Trinidad and Tobago are usually linked to criminal activities in other States. The spread of democracy and open societies adds a new urgency to collaborative measures which must be taken by the international community to contain these criminal acts.The most pernicious manifestations of international criminal activity  including the illicit traffic in drugs and terrorism  continue even as we enter this United Nations Decade of International Law. Governments of large and small States are becoming increasingly aware that international criminal activity is not only lucrative  efficient and resilient  but is also resistant to control measures. More disturbingly  these forms of crime do not respect national frontiers or jurisdictions. It is a cruel irony that as our planet becomes smaller through advances in science and technology  especially in the field of communications  open societies have become more vulnerable to those who deal in terror  degradation and death. In response to the menace of international criminal activity  my delegation introduced at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly a new item which sought to establish an international criminal court. The General Assembly mandated the International Law Commission to examine that proposal and to submit a report at this session for its consideration.We are convinced that an international criminal court will enhance and strengthen the capacity of the international community to deal with international crime. I have myself discussed this proposal at various International and regional bodies  including meetings with my fellow Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community. In June this year  a meeting of the Committee of Experts on an International Criminal Jurisdiction  held at Siracusa  Italy  building on the foundations laid down by scholarship and expertise over the years  fully supported and elaborated a comprehensive draft statute on such a court.We are aware that the proposal for the establishment of an international criminal court has raised fundamental questions. Some of these relate to jurisdiction and sovereignty. There is no gainsaying that these issues are extremely important. They do not  however  present intractable problems and can be satisfactorily addressed in the interests of progress and our- collective security.Indeed  I am pleased to note that in its report the International Law Commission has advised that the establishment of an international criminal court is more feasible at this time and has recommended  moreover  that international traffic in drugs should be considered a crime against humanity.Even more recently  the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders  held at Havana  passed by consensus a resolution encouraging the International Law Commission to continue its work in relation to the codification of international criminal law and the establishment of an international criminal court. In the resolution passed by the Congress special provision was made for the protection of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States.I am confident that there is now greater understanding of the utility and practicability of an international criminal jurisdiction by Member States and that  guided by the requisite political will and vision  substantial progress will be made at this session towards its establishment.We conceive of an international criminal court not as an end in itself or in isolation/ but as part of a whole range of services required for effective law enforcement. Some of these services already exist in relations between States; I refer to exchanges of vital intelligence  both formal and informal; arrangements for the transfer of offenders between States under treaties of extradition or by other modalities; arrangements for the reciprocal recognition of judgements and orders; for the reception of evidence; and the wide range of Co-operative and collaborative activity which the security and judicial services of friendly States already engage in routinely  both formally and informally. These mechanisms and practices are essential to our individual and collective security. Where they are absent  States must be encouraged to put them in place. Where they are already in place  they must be strengthened  a court will ensure the greater effectiveness of these administrative and judicial arrangements and greater protection for security and sovereignty  particularly of small States. Essentially  it is stability and world order that are at stake.Neither a free State nor a free world can long endure without adequate safeguards for the rule of law.Trinidad and Tobago has repeatedly condemned the use of force as a means of settling disputes. We cannot accept  and we strongly condemn  such forcible annexation of a member state of this body as has occurred in Kuwait. We reaffirm our unswerving commitment to respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all States in accordance with the principles of our Charter. We urge that a peaceful resolution of the matter be found in a manner that restores the independence of Kuwait.Security  however  cannot be looked at merely in terms of police and judicial functions  although these are essential parts of the equation. We must also move speedily and purposefully to tackle problems that inhibit social and economic development in the world today.In many developing countries the symptoms of frustration and malaise are obvious  h punishing combination of external influences has drastically reduced real incomes and investment; annual growth rates continue to plummet; per capita gross national product continues to decline; non-fuel commodity prices have reached disastrously low levels; and deteriorating terms of trade militate against benefits from increased export earnings. The impact of these factors has been exacerbated by the overwhelming debt crisis. The devastating cumulative effect of all this has been a large net transfer of resources from countries in the developing world to the developed world. I have said before  and I repeat  that no civilized community  can tolerate the continuation of such a state of affairs.  The collective effort of the international community has yet to yield realistic and acceptable solutions to the immense and complicated problems created by external debt  debt servicing and this outward transfer of resources.The debt strategies which have been proposed to date have not addressed the plight of Middle-income debtor countries. Specific problems· are sometimes masked because of the general use of per capita gross national product as the measurement of economic development. Attention needs to b· given to the importance of expenditures in essential areas such as health  education  housing and social welfare. Development is too often perceived in terms of economic growth  while the factors which affect the quality of life are neglected.If the real concerns of developing nations are ignored or are inadequately addressed  than the already great disparities between the North and South will increase dramatically and the gulf between the  will widen. In this regard  support for the Uruguay Bound and trade negotiations is imperative.Lot the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly set the stage for a collective response to the economic deterioration that has plunged many countries of the developing world into crisis  threatening their social cohesion  peace and security.Trinidad and Tobago was pleased to have become a part of the historic World Summit for Children  held a few days ago. The faithful implementation of the World Declaration on the Survival  Protection and Development of Children and the related Plan of Action will go a long way towards protecting the rights and improving the lives of our children. My government is committed to the sections outlined in these agreements  and will pursue their implementation as vigorously as we have pursued strategies related to the advancement of women and other United Nations initiatives which place people at the centre of development.Another particular concern of Trinidad and Tobago  as an island State  is the question of management and conservation of marine resources. Representatives will recall that the fortieth session of the General Assembly addressed the issue of large-scale pelagic fishing and its impact on the living marine resources of the world's oceans and seas. The General Assembly noted that largo-scale pelagic driftnet fishing was a highly indiscriminate and wasteful method that threatened the effective conservation of living marine resources. In Trinidad and Tobago it also threatens the livelihood of our artisan fishermen.Accordingly  in response to recent reports of vessels with large-scale driftnet fishing equipment operating off Trinidad and Tobago  the Government has imposed а ban on this type of fishing in its national waters and a prohibition of landing rights to vessels with such drift-net equipment. Trinidad and Tobago is the first country in the North Atlantic to have taken such definitive action.Demonstrating our concern over environmental issues  the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has undertaken to host the Seventh Latin American and Caribbean Conference of Ministers Responsible for the Environment  to be held frost 15-23 of this month. It is expected that the Conference will formulate a regional action plan which will incorporate existing environmental policies  such as the Port-of-Spain Accord and the Amazon Declaration  and lead in the coming months to concrete programmes of environmental action. My Government wishes to reiterate its full support for the proposed International Conference on Environment and Development  scheduled to be held in Brazil in 1992.Already I perceive a sense of renewed vigour and commitment in this Organisation  which embodies the hopes and aspirations of our community of nations. Let us work assiduously and unceasingly to increase respect for the rule of law  to advance the cause of justice and respect for the dignity of man and to improve the lot of our fellow human beings everywhere. Let this session attain new heights of human achievement. Let it match the aspirations of the millions who have so moved and inspired us by the cataclysmic changes that they have wrought in peace during the past year. "
"141",6948,"TUN",45,1990,"﻿It is a pleasure for me to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the Tunisian delegation  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the current session and success in the accomplishment of your noble mission.We are completely convinced of your success  knowing as we do your outstanding qualities  your long experience and your continued efforts in the service of justice and peace. This election is a tribute by the international community to your friendly country  Malta  for the important role it plays within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and on the Mediterranean and international scene. The Tunisian delegation will be pleased to co-operate closely with you during your presidency of this session in order to attain the objectives for which our dynamic organisation is working.It is also a pleasure for me to extend to your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Joseph Garba representative of fraternal Nigeria to the United Nations  our beat wishes and appreciation for the great competence with which he presided over our last session and the considerable efforts that he made to resolve our problems with wisdom and effectiveness.It is also a special pleasure for mo to take this opportunity to express directly to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez do Cuellar· our profound esteem for the commendable efforts that he unceasingly makes so generously in the service of peace the world over and for the implementation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in international relations.I am also pleased to extend a welcome  on behalf of my delegation  to the Principality of Liechtenstein. This admission supports the universality of the United Nations  the world forum of all countries large or small at this time when the concept of international solidarity is being strengthened.While the last session witnessed a number of positive developments which aroused optimism and reassurance that the world would continue to evolve toward stronger understanding  the difficult context in which the present session is being held is a source of concern and disquiet  because of the crisis which is developing dangerously in the Gulf region.The present escalation of this crisis is the harbinger of the gravest of threats to security and peace in the region and in the world at large. This is why we wish to give it our complete attention before referring to the many successes achieved by the United Nations in different fields  thanks to the combined efforts of its members. Tunisia has voiced its profound concern about this crisis from the very beginning. It was our hope that the two parties to the conflict might arrive at a solution to the dispute through dialogue and negotiations  given the relations of fraternity and good-neighbourliness that bind them. Unfortunately however  the situation quickly became complicated and assumed considerable proportions  due to military escalation  the fact that the dispute spilled over to neighbouring countries and the intervention of certain States from outside the region.Tunisia has made tireless efforts to contribute to the containment of the crisis because of the privileged relations that it has with both the fraternal countries  Iraq and Kuwait and because it belongs to the Arab Muslim world and is profoundly committed to international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations as well as that of the League of Arab States  primary among which are the non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  the commitment to resolve conflicts by peaceful means and the non-threat or use of force in the settlement of disputes between States.In all its endeavours  Tunisia has sought to confine the conflict within its Arab context  in the belief that widening the scope of the conflict would jeopardize the search for a peaceful solution. We believe that if an Arab solution to the conflict had been given a real chance  many of the subsequent complications  such as the landing of foreign forces on Arab soil could have been avoided  and we would thus have been spared the emotional impact that the crisis has had on Arab and Muslim peoples and the threat of a war that could break out at any time and that would be detrimental to the region regardless of its outcome. Furthermore  international relations and the economic situation would undoubtedly be influenced by this war which might break out. In spite of the difficulties of the present situation and the complexity of inter-Arab relations it is still our belief that there exists a chance of finding a solution to this crisis within a strictly Arab context. Such a chance should not be overlooked it exits and it is necessary.On this basis  and in an attempt to contribute effectively to resolving the crisis  Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  President of the Republic of Tunisia  stepped up contacts and consultations with many fraternal and friendly heads of State. We received a number of special envoys from the two countries directly concerned and emissaries from many other Arab and non-Arab heads of State. We also sent special envoys to the two Arab States directly concerned  the permanent members of the Security Council  the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the leaders of the European community  with messages and concrete proposals that might constitute the framework of a solution in accordance with international legality and based on the following principles: release of civilians being held in Iraq and Kuwait; withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait; replacement of foreign forces by Arab forces; guaranteeing the security for all the States of the Gulf; resolving the vital problems that led to the crisis; resolving the problems of the Middle East and the Arab nation  which the international community has not yet been able to deal with  because it has not been able to implement numerous United Nations resolutions that it was adopted thus far.Tunisia still pursues the path of peaceful solution. Our President has sent the Tunisian Prime Minister as envoy to President Saddam Hussein  with specific proposals  in search of a window of opportunity in this grave situation. We hope that those proposals could be implemented in response to the need for harmony among peoples and the imperatives of peace and security in the region. We note with satisfaction the favourable reception of those proposals. We take this opportunity to reaffirm our adherence to the Security Council resolutions concerning the Gulf crisis. In this respect  we have submitted a report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We have also informed many international institutions and organisations  about the negative impact on our national economy resulting from the implementation of the embargo while at the same time stressing the exceptions concerning medication and foodstuffs mentioned in Security Council resolution 661 (1990) itself. On the basis of these ideas  and completely in accordance with human rights principles  we reject  and have always rejected  the involvement of civilians in conflicts and any violation of their freedom of movement. Tunisia has always supported and upheld the moral authority of the United Nations. It has placed its capabilities at the service of the United Nations. The latest example of this was Tunisia's participation in the process of the independence of Namibia. We believe that the United Nations is the depositary of the high values enshrined in the Charter  which establishes an international code of conduct and remain firmly convinced that the Organisation is able to shoulder its responsibilities in safeguarding peace  as it has done on many occasions in different parts of the world. Tunisia has been supported by the United Nations on every occasion whenever it suffered aggression because of its stance in favour of the cause of justice and freedom.Our fond belief in international legality and firm commitment to its true meaning cannot be dissociated from each other. If the crisis in the Gulf is a form of a breach of legality  there are many precedents in the history of the United Nations that show that in the ease of other injustices the voice of the United Nations has not been heard and there has been no deterrence. The most striking example of this is the injustice that has been inflicted on the Palestinian people  whose legitimate right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on their own soil has been denied  while Israel persists in refusing to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.It is unnecessarily to recall the dozens of resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council concerning the Palestinian cause which have so far remained dead letters because of Israeli stubbornness and disdain for international law.We firmly believe the United Nations is called upon to implement its resolutions on this issue as assiduously and as firmly and trenchantly as it does in the case of the Gulf crisis lest people the world over get the impression that the handling of world issues is selective  discriminatory and dependent on the parties involved  the interests at stake and the circumstances.The current painful situation in the Gulf region  with the risk of explosion that it entails  must not make us forget the daily suffering of the Palestinian people  who  without weapons  is heroically resisting Israeli occupation  an occupation which is injurious to their identity their existence and their land. From this rostrum we pay a heartfelt tribute to the heroic uprising  the intifadah which is about to enter its fourth year of struggle  while acts of repression continue unabated. We once again make a pressing appeal to the international conscience to support firmly the Palestinian people  under their legitimate leadership  so that they may completely recover their right to independence freedom and dignity.Surely it is the international community's most urgent duty to oppose Israeli plans to modify the demographic map of the occupied Arab territories through the settlement of Jews from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the expulsion of Palestinians from their lands. In accordance with international legality and the resolutions of the United Nations  we stress the need to convene as soon as possible an international conference for peace in the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  which  with a high sense of responsibility has demonstrated its commitment to the search for a peaceful  just and lasting solution of the Palestinian problem and the conflict in the Middle East.Fraternal Lebanon has recently made some progress towards a definitive solution guaranteeing to its people security  stability and territorial integrity. We welcome the progress that has been achieved  thanks to the determination of the children of Lebanon  in restoring harmony in the country  and thanks to their accurate assessment of their responsibility for overcoming the deadlock. This made it possible to arrive at the Taif Agreement and also made possible the continuing selfless work of the Arab Tripartite Commission  which is now tackling the last obstacles  which we hope will be removed as soon as possible in the higher interests of Lebanon and in order to bring about the return of calm and prosperity in the framework of reconciliation and civil peace.While the Middle East has many crises that await solution  the region also has many positive aspects and a desire for stability and peace. I would like at this point to welcome the achievement of peaceful unity between the two Yemens and the emergence of a single unified Yemen.We are firmly convinced of the ability of the United Nations to participate effectively in overcoming the Gulf crisis with its repercussions and find an appropriate solution to the conflict in the Middle East  just as it has done successfully in the case of other conflicts where it has shown itself to be on the side of justice and freedom  and quite capable of eliminating many hotbeds of tension.We were profoundly pleased to see Namibia  that fraternal country  join the ranks of independent States and take its rightful place among nations  thanks to the unyielding struggle of its people and the support of the international community. We wish to pay tribute to the front-line States for the great sacrifices that they made to aid the cause of Namibia. We also laud the role played by the United Nations in support of the independence process in Namibia. I wish to take this opportunity to extend  on behalf of Tunisia  my warmest congratulations to the delegation of Namibia on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations as a full Member. We are certain that the young State of Namibia  whose people paid a high price for its independence  will fully play its role in the service of the African continent and in the service of the cause of justice  freedom and peace  by contributing to the strengthening of the Organisation of African Unity and the efforts of the United Nations in the areas of development  stability  security and peace.Proud to be African  Tunisia has unceasingly worked for solidarity among the Continent's peoples and will spare no effort in helping the Namibian people to build its young State in accordance with the recommendations of the Organisation of African Unity. We hope that the international community will come to Namibia's aid in order to enable it to meet the challenge of development and progress.The achievements and the progress made on the African continent in the field of decolonisation and independence will remain incomplete as long as injustice persists in South Africa  where the white minority continues to violate the most basic of human rights by practising racial discrimination and violate international norms and conventions.While expressing our joy over the release of the leader and freedom fighter Nelson Mandela who has regained his freedom after more than a quarter-century of imprisonment  we note with cautious optimism the few modest initiatives taken by the Government of South Africa  which in fact fall short of introducing the radical changes that would guarantee equality for all and establish a democratic regime where the majority is able to exercise its legitimate rights. That is why the international community must not relax its pressure in the form of an economic embargo or other effective measures until Pretoria compiles with law and justice  especially now that these pressures are beginning to produce results and prove their effectiveness.We must remain vigilant In order to thwart any intrigues and manoeuvres that may be designed to fuel antagonisms and internal strife in order to abort the expected process of change and spread terror and disorder.Tunisia is following with deep concern the developments in the situation in Afghanistan. We have expressed our profound satisfaction following the signing of the Geneva conventions and this withdrawal of Soviet troops from that fraternal country  but the in-fighting among brothers unfortunately persists and continues to take a heavy toll in Afghani lives and cause destruction in the country.It is our hope that international efforts to help Afghanistan recover its national unity within a framework of harmony will succeed sad that it will be able to establish the system of its choice in full freedom and at last tackle the reconstruction and development of the country.We express the same hope regarding the framework agreement concluded on 28 August 1990 by the five permanent members of the Security Council in respect of Cambodia. This agreement conferred important administrative responsibility upon the United Nations. It is our hope that this will contribute to the settlement of the conflict that persists in that friendly country and that it will be possible to achieve lasting peace in the region. We also hope that the parties to the conflict will profit from this valuable opportunity to promote reconciliation among themselves through constructive and effective dialogue and thus restore harmony and peace to the Cambodian people. We also view with satisfaction the efforts made to unify the Korean peninsula. Tunisia  which has traditional bonds of friendship with the two States  is delighted at the resumption of contacts between the two with a view to reconciliation and national unity. We see in this a contribution that is bound to strengthen the climate of peace and co-operation in the Asian continent and the world at large. Perhaps we are not far from the day when we shall see the Korean peninsula represented in this Assembly.The increasingly frequent use of peaceful means to resolve international disputes represents a positive element in the establishment of a world based on understanding and agreement. But the strengthening of this tendency requires that we renounce the arms race. It requires the abandonment of the policy of hegemony and the use of force in international relations in order to arrive at complete disarmament - a prerequisite for international detente to be a reality. This detente has become a vital and urgent requirement not only to safeguard peace in world over but also because of its positive impact on the world economy which is now undergoing an untenable crisis one of whose main causes is the major imbalance between the considerable expenditures of industrialised countries on weaponry and the modest funds allocated to development assistance.Undoubtedly  security  peace and stability will create an atmosphere of serenity in the developing countries and will make it possible for them to limit their military expenditures and thus to apply their potential to action for development.Tunisia  on the strength of its convictions and pursuant to the path it has charted for itself at the regional level  has worked for the strengthening of security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region and  in this respect  we view with satisfaction the understanding shown by our European friends and their growing conviction of the need for joint action in order to strengthen solidarity among Mediterranean States.The question of pollution has unceasingly concerned the international community because of its negative impact on the environment. It has harmed to different degrees all the countries of the world in varying ways - for example  the pollution of the oceans and seas  desertification  soil erosion  deforestation  sudden and violent changes in global climate  as well as toxic wastes that certain industrialised countries attempt to dump on the territories of others  particularly in Africa.Aware of the serious nature of this question  Tunisia reacted at the national level by taking the initiative in 1988 to create the national environmental protection agency and enacting the laws we need to combat all types of pollution.On the African level  Tunisia is preparing to contribute effectively to the success o£ the Year of the Environment in Africa  which is planned for 1991  and we will thus show our readiness to co-operate with our African brethren and exchange experiences in this field.Among the dangers threatening the integrity of the individual and the health of society is the spread of narcotic drugs. Although Tunisia is neither a producer nor a consumer of those drugs  it is resolutely fighting this scourge by establishing many control agencies in order to monitor probable transit points and stem the development of this traffic. It is acting in constant collaboration with specialised international agencies in order to eliminate this phenomenon.Tunisia  which made radical changes in its society on 7 November 1987 - changes which led to the establishment e£ a democratic regime based on pluralism and freedom of thought is a State where law and institutions rule and which has unceasingly worked to strengthen human and community rights - confirms its strong devotion and total commitment to the United Nations Charter and also proclaims its intention to translate the Charter's lofty purposes and principles into concrete reality on the national and international levels.In that context  at the beginning of the year Tunisia presented a preliminary report concerning the implementation of the international Convention against Torture and other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to the Committee against Torture.Tunisia also submitted on 16 and 17 July 1990 its third report on the implementation of the international Covenant on civil and political rights to the Commission concerned.On another level  and pursuant to its desire to strengthen the rights of children  Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on the Sights of the Child which will be ratified in the very near future. We enthusiastically support the initiative to convene the World Summit for Children which will be an opportunity for the international community to voice its commitment to the rights off the child.Furthermore  Tunisia supports all initiatives aimed at strengthening the rights of the handicapped.Tunisia has been delighted at the profound changes that have occurred in today's world and  above all  in Eastern Europe with a view to enshrining public freedoms and the foundations of democracy and respect for human rights.These are considerable achievements that augur well for an international community that can at last enjoy development  prosperity and dignity. On the other hand  we must in all objectivity voice our concern over the tendency to marginalize  at least in political discourse  the developing countries in general and the African continent in particular. That tendency  we believe  has a negative impact on the material and moral situation of the third world countries which are confronted by a situation of worsening poverty due to a reduction in external resources and the dichotomy between long-term development objectives and short-term structural adjustment.While recognising once again before the Assembly our responsibility to remedy that situation  we note with some bitterness that the major sacrifices made at the national level are gravely endangered because our financial obligations exceed our real ability to pay. Zn that respect  the study on the global economy conducted by the United Nations Secretariat as well as the World Bank report devoted this year to poverty  highlight the aggravation of that phenomenon and its negative impact on the resumption of development in the developing countries.The World Bank has advocated the implementation of a strategy to fight that scourge  which will constitute the main challenge to the international community in the 1990s. We support that initiative  which buttresses the appeal made by the developing countries to the international financial institutions to take the social dimension into greater account in their economic recovery programmes. The success of that strategy  as we see it  will depend on an improvement in modalities of assistance and on increased support from the international community in the implementation of national policies freely established by the developing countries for the struggle against poverty.experience has shown that the developing countries cannot achieve sustained growth while withstanding the hardships of inflation and the weight of foreign indebtedness. Mr. Camdessus  the Director General of the International Monetary Fund  eloquently described that situation as one of ""growth spurts”. He also stressed  at last July's session of the Economic and Social Council  the Fund's decision to contain and attenuate the effects of the recovery programmes in order to guarantee a better balance of adjustment  growth and social justice.That initiative demonstrates the need to give priority to non-inflationary growth based on a system of multilateral co-ordination and broadened monitoring  even if the question of reconciling effectiveness and justice  productivity and humaneness  remains. In that respect  the President of the Republic  Mr. Ben Ali  had the opportunity  during his presidency of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)  to express Tunisia's position on indebtedness to Mr. Bettino Craxi  Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the debt question  to whom we should like to extend our sincere thanks for the report now before the Assembly.Need we dwell on the precarious situation of the indebted developing countries  and in particular on the situation of Tunisia  which is among the medium-income countries? We believe that Mr. Craxi's report reflects the main concerns expressed by our countries in that respect. It is our fear that the foreign debt problem may lead the international community and multilateral agencies into an impasse at a time when we see on the horizon the premises of a real peace. That may occur because of the absence of a real will to change international financial mechanisms and find an appropriate solution to the problem.In that respect  Tunisia supports the proposals contained in Mr. Craxi's report concerning a reconversion of bilateral debt through participation in the establishment of a development bank in the Mediterranean  the cancellation of debt-servicing for the least developed countries and the establishment of new payment timetables from 30 to 40 years. The implementation of those proposals  we feel  would contribute to resolving the foreign debt crisis of the developing countries. Heed we recall that a solution to the crisis constitutes one of the commitments undertaken by the international community at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to the resumption of growth and development?Towards that end  the special session of the General Assembly focused the collective and concerted will for action on the progressive alleviation of the profound imbalances current in the world economy  taking into greater account the role and interests of the developing countries. That session also had the merit of speeding up the integration of the Eastern European countries into the international economy and of facilitating their accession to international institutions in order to enable them to increase their role as dynamic trading partners.We also view with satisfaction the contribution of that session to the strengthening of multilateralism in international economic relations. We take this opportunity to reaffirm the importance we attach to respect for the consensus achieved at the special session. We believe that to be all the more important now on the eve of two major gatherings - the eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the conclusion of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  the success of which will depend on respect for the interests of all  the effective participation of all countries  and their compliance with the conclusions that will be reached through the mobilisation of the necessary political will.The Declaration of international Economic Co-operation rightly stresses that an open and credible multilateral trade system is essential for the promotion of growth and development. We continue to believe that the establishment of such a system remains possible  bearing in mind the growing interdependence between different sectors and national economies and that it is indeed urgent in order to remedy the asymmetry in structures of production and consumption at the global level.Now that the growing interdependence of nations is broadly acknowledged  we must identify the ways and means of managing that interdependence in order to take into greater account the aspirations and legitimate concerns of all. Thus  the recent developments toward economic integration agreements and free-trade zones continue to arouse both hope and concern  given the challenges faced by less productive trade partners.In our view  it is important to take measures to dispel those fears. We hope that the implementation of such arrangements will contribute to creating trade and not to distorting it. It is in that spirit that the five countries of the Maghreb created the AMU  one more step towards integration and co-operation among their peoples and the African peoples in general.This year  important progress has been achieved in co-operation among the countries of the Maghreb. Tunisia had the honour to participate in the strengthening of that co-operation when it held the chairmanship of the AMU. We are convinced that concerted Maghreb action will continue in the interests of the peoples of the region in order to achieve economic and social development  and that that will be a factor of stability  understanding  and the strengthening of peace and security at the regional and international levels. In this respect the Union of the Arab Maghreb has promoted the establishment of constructive and open co-operation with peace-loving nations and with most regional groups  especially those that are linked to the Union by traditional and historic relationships based on geographic proximity  particularly in the Mediterranean region  where it is possible to develop a platform of co-operation and understanding based on the principle of shared development for the sake of prosperity and the security of the coastal countries.She co-operation that we seek to establish between the countries of the northern and southern Mediterranean should have as its objective the reduction of disparities  thanks to a freely-entered-into policy that tackles our development problems - first and foremost  indebtedness  immigration and the environment.I should like  at the conclusion of my statement  to underscore the close interdependence between development imperatives and the continuation of the process of democracy in the developing countries. The phenomenon of economic recession that we have noted in many countries constitutes a real danger to regional and international peace.In this respect  hopes for detente and international understanding would be jeopardised unless all member countries were to show resolute political will in the search for an equitable solution to the problem of indebtedness. This would be the best guarantee of a new international order  such as is perhaps just now emerging. The international community must therefore go beyond any selfishness and must establish co-operation and co-ordination between its members so that we can approach the third millennium with hope and serenity  and so that we can achieve development for all countries during this development decade  for which President Ben Ali appealed at the last session of the General Assembly. "
"142",6995,"TUR",45,1990,"﻿It is a source of particular pleasure for me to see Mr. de Marco  the representative of a fellow Mediterranean country  presiding over this session of the General Assembly. I congratulate him on his well-deserved election to this high post and I am confident that under his able guidance  this session will tackle the problems before it with vision and wisdom  thus making an important contribution to peace and stability.I also wish to pay a tribute to Major-General Joseph Garba the President of the Assembly at the forty-fourth session  for his outstanding competence in guiding the work of the General Assembly during a hectic yet fruitful period.I wish also to thank the Secretary-General of our Organisation  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his singular contribution to the success of the United Nations during this fateful period. The current session of the General Assembly has been convened against a background of the momentous events that have taken place during the past 12 months. Indeed  until the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq in August  this was a time in which tidings of hope and joy were the predominant note. The trends which were gaining momentum as we met last year have started to bear fruit. Having witnessed the crumbling of the Berlin wall  the disintegration of the iron curtain  the collapse of totalitarian regimes and the birth of a new Europe  we can confidently talk about the end of the cold war. I should like to extend my Government's warm congratulations to the two German delegations present here on their having achieved in a smooth and successful way the unification of the German nation under the roof of a democratic and peaceful German State  which will certainly contribute to stability in Europe.It has been encouraging to observe that the dramatic and positive chain of events remoulding Europe has also helped lessen some of the tensions elsewhere on our planet. In that context  it inspires further hope in us to see that the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) has made remarkable headway in Europe by achieving new milestones in the monitoring of human rights  the strengthening of co-operation on environmental issues and the reinforcement of confidence-building mechanisms  along with increased conventional stability measures.The world at largo has also benefited from the opportunities offered by a Europe at peace with itself. Arms control efforts now proffer a more promising future. Turkey believes that those efforts can be useful only if they are pursued without diminishing the security of the countries concerned. The disarmament process can be beneficial to the extent that it does not reduce the security attained through defence and deterrence. As a corollary to its peace-oriented foreign policy  Turkey will continue to contribute to the ongoing endeavours in search of success in both of these processes. Moreover  recalling the confirmation at the Copenhagen meeting of the CSCE of the commitment to abide by the ideals of democracy  pluralism and the rule of law  we believe that respect for human rights  which constitutes the pedestal of this edifice  will assume a higher priority among the domains in which the United Nations is increasingly active.	As international tensions ease and a more favourable climate emerges  the standards and goals set in Copenhagen will not remain confined to Europe and North America but will serve as a paradigm for the whole world in helping promote the cause of human rights.Running against the tide of history by committing a pre-Second-World-War type of aggression  a Member of the United Nations  itself only recently disengaged from an eight-year war  invaded and occupied the territory of another Member of the United Nations nearly two months ago. That deplorable event occurred in an already volatile part of the globe and has further aggravated a precarious and delicate situation. The United Nations has passed the initial phase of this severe test with remarkable success. The Security Council resolutions promptly adopted in the wake of the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait clearly demonstrated the firm determination of the United Nations to establish the principle that such acts contrary to modern norms of international behaviour shall not be tolerated.Turkey  situated as it is adjacent to the Middle East and having close historical ties with both of the countries involved in this deplorable affair  attaches the utmost importance to the careful fulfilment of the goals and objectives set out by the Security Council. We also subscribe to the measures foreseen in the relevant Council resolutions and to their strict implementation. My Government is deeply concerned that there is the danger of a conflagration that might engulf the entire Middle East unless Iraqi forces are completely and unconditionally withdrawn from Kuwait and the legitimate Kuwaiti Government is restored. Naturally  such a withdrawal and restoration should be coupled with the immediate release of all foreigners held hostage by Iraq. Turkey firmly believes that United Nations sanctions should be fully enforced and holds the opinion that this course of action has the greatest chance to end the current crisis peacefully. It is in that spirit that Turkey will continue to make heavy sacrifices to secure full compliance with the Security Council's resolutions.Despite many discouraging signs  Turkey hopes that the Gulf crisis can be settled without degenerating into armed conflict. While anticipating a peaceful settlement  we nevertheless consider it imperative that the lessons the crisis has taught should be underlined. First of all  the international community must redouble its efforts aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear  chemical  biological and missile technology. Secondly  the determination to work together against threats to peace which has manifested itself between the super-Powers and the other permanent members of the Security Council in the aftermath of the cold war must be maintained.The cease-fire in the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq  the setting in motion of the process which culminated in Namibia's independence  the arrangements that led to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  and efforts now under way to resolve conflicts in Cambodia  Central America and Western Sahara could not have been realised had the United Nations not been strengthened by the increasing harmony among the permanent members of the Security Council.Last year my predecessor had to draw the attention of the Assembly to the tragic situation of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria. Since that time  the regime in that country has changed  and we are hopeful that the positive developments taking place in Bulgaria  will make possible the full affirmation of Minority rights very soon.Turkey's firm stand on the question of Palestine  which constitutes the crux of the Middle East dispute  has been expressed from this rostrum on many occasions. The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza is a direct result of the frustration of the Palestinians. The attempts to suppress the rebellion by force and violence are bound to prove futile  especially in the long run. The Palestinians must take due care not to tarnish their image by being provoked into acts that could be construed as a relapse into terrorism. Israel  for its part  must cast aside its intransigence so that the current stalemate in the peace process can be broken. Furthermore  Israel should also halt its systematic attempts to modify the demographic composition of the occupied Arab territories.The situation in Afghanistan continues to be a source of concern for Turkey. In spite of the fact that much has been accomplished in bringing the conflicting parties together  the need for a broad-based government fully ¡representing the Afghan people still stands out as an essential component in the search for a lasting settlement of this problem. Pakistan's generosity and patience in bearing the brunt of the burden of providing shelter to the Afghan refugees also continue to deserve much praise; the international community's indebtedness to Pakistan is assuming ever-growing proportions. The recent unrest in Jaimu and Kashmir is a source of anxiety for us. We are especially concerned about the threatening movement of forces from their peace-time positions. We hope that all the necessary efforts will be made to defuse the tensions in that sensitive part of the world  and we welcome the dialogue between Pakistan and India designed to achieve this end. We are of the opinion that the 1972 Simla agreement and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations may be the framework for a peaceful solution of this issue.The accession to independence of Namibia in March this year has been a source of great pleasure for us. We have been deeply gratified to recognize this new member of the family of nations  one with which we have promptly established diplomatic relations. Coupled with the developments that began with the freeing of Mr. Nelson Mandela in neighbouring South Africa  and with the progress towards the dismantling of apartheid in that country  we hope that we may  after all  be witnessing the dawning of a batter and more promising era in the southern part of the African continent.Moving back to Asia  we welcome the positive developments in Cambodia. If the trend of the last few months is maintained  an end to the ordeal of this long-suffering nation may be in the offing. Turkey is prepared to support United-Nations-sponsored endeavours to assist Cambodia's return to the democratic process. Turning to the Korean peninsula  we support the initiatives undertaken by the Republic of Korea for a meaningful dialogue with its northern neighbour. We hope that the recent high-level contacts between the two States will facilitate the finding of a peaceful solution to the issues between them  thus leading to their eventual representation as full Members of our Organisation. The abuse of and illicit trafficking in narcotics has now become a deadly scourge menacing the social fabric of all countries. In some of them  this evil has assumed the dimensions of a destabilising force that even undermines political and economic structures. Often linked to arms smuggling and  thereby  to international terrorism  the issue has acquired increasingly disturbing proportions. At this point I should like to express again our firm solidarity with the Government and people of Colombia in their valiant struggle against the merchants of death. Other countries engaged in similar struggles also have our full sympathy.International terrorism still casts a dark shadow over relations between nations and  as a major source of tension  continues to be a global problem. Experience gives adequate proof that even tolerating  not to mention supporting  terrorism is counterproductive  and those who condone such activities have always had reason to regret their short-sighted policies. Turkey condemns all forms of terrorism  regardless of their origins  causes and purposes  as criminal and unjustifiable. We remain attached to a policy of firmness via-à-vis this evil.After 27 years the Cyprus problem still awaits a negotiated settlement. On several occasions the Turkish Cypriot side has made constructive proposals and accepted negotiated ideas for a solution. The Secretary-General himself has also exerted considerable effort towards the same end. Nevertheless  a mutually agreed solution continues to elude us. The determining element in the Cyprus issue is the political equality of the two sides in the island: this is the single most important fact about Cyprus. Independence and the state of affairs created in 1960 were founded on the principle of equality and the partnership of the two peoples. While the 1960 order was soon destroyed by the Greek Cypriots through the use of force to establish their hegemony and annex the island to Greece  the principle of the equal status of the two communities has continued to guide all subsequent developments.Indeed  the negotiating process and the Secretary-General's mission of good offices have over the years been based on the fact that there is a political dispute between the two peoples in Cyprus and that  as the parties to the dispute  these two peoples are political equals. The most recent confirmation of this principle is to be found in Security Council resolution 649 (1990)  adopted unanimously on 12 March this year. In that resolution the Security Council calls for a freely reached and mutually acceptable solution to be arrived at through negotiations on an equal footing. Full respect for the status of equality of the two communities is a sine qua non for progress in Cyprus.The Greek Cypriots must recognize that the object of inter-communal negotiations is to create a new partnership that would bring together the two peoples and their respective administrations within a new political association based on equality. The reason why the Cyprus question remains unresolved today is the Greek Cypriot refusal to accept the Turkish Cypriots as their equals. This is the attitude that underlies their application to the European Communities for full membership: they claim that they can act unilaterally in a matter that concerns the future political and economic status of the whole island. This claim has no legal  moral or factual basis  but it does show the true nature of Greek Cypriot perceptions.The Greek Cypriot mentality views the Turkish Cypriots as adversaries who must be forced into obedience by whatever means possible. This is a far cry from the notion of equality. This mentality is also responsible for one of the most serious cases of human rights violations against the Turkish Cypriots  whose lives and well-being were in constant danger until 1974  were forced to survive in small enclaves for many years. Since 1974 they have been subjected to a ruthless and pervasive embargo by the Greek Cypriots  and are faced with an incessant Greek Cypriot campaign to isolate them from the rest of the world. Today the Turkish Cypriots have to overcome Greek Cypriot obstacles to their trading and travelling freely. They cannot send or receive letters directly. Their young people cannot compete in international sports. Foreign ships and aircraft are prevented from operating to and from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. What have the Turkish Cypriots done to deserve this? Nothing except to defend their equality and their rights. This unacceptable situation must be brought to an end» and the rights of the Turkish Cypriots must be respected. Only when relations between the two sides take a turn for the better can the efforts of the Secretary-General have a real chance of making progress in the direction indicated by Security Council resolution 649 (1990). Notwithstanding the sombre cloud created by the ongoing Gulf crisis  the positive and encouraging elements of the evolving international scene need to be reinforced by sound economic and social development. After a decade of missed opportunities the prospects for the world economy today appear brighter  provided that the inflationary trends spurred by the increase in oil prices and the recessionist pressures that are becoming more visible can be held in check. The opening of Eastern Europe to a market-based economic development  although difficult in the transitional phrase of restructarization  is a good sign for the future. None the less  the fears of the developing countries that Eastern Europe will divert already-limited financial flows away from them deserve to be addressed as a legitimate concern.On the threshold of the last decade of the twentieth century we observe that economic and social problems related to population  poverty  unemployment  uneven income distribution  environmental degradation and the over-exploitation of natural resources not only have grown worse but have become more interlinked and globalized. These problems are especially acute in the developing world  and the debt burden in that world renders the task of surmounting poverty and its interrelated issues all the more difficult.Despite all odds  the developing countries are bravely going through readjustment efforts to break out of stagnation and to make up  through resumed growth  for the assets created by the recession of the 1980s. These efforts need to be supported by an appropriate international economic environment. Emerging trade blocs have fuelled fears of protectionism  which need to be overcome through the adoption and implementation of realistic policies. We believe that healthy growth depends on freer trade rather than on aid. In this respect we hope that the Uruguay Round negotiations will have a successful outcome by the end of the year. On the other hand  despite the importance of trade unhindered by import barriers  financial flows are still necessary. The present trend of flows in the opposite direction has to be corrected. To that end the policies to be adopted by the developing countries themselves  as well as those pursued by international financial institutions  will play an equally significant role.The least-developed countries have even more pressing issues confronting them  and we welcome the result of the second United Nations Conference for those countries  which ended just two weeks ago. The various aspects of environmental degradation have now become more evident and call for different  but complementary and co-ordinated  responses. We believe that without an adequately preserved environment there can be no sustained long-term development. Therefore  the importance of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in 1992  as well as its preparatory process  cannot be overestimated. This  we believe  will be a timely meeting  since new environmental questions continue to arise  while existing problems require more attention and concerted action.In concluding my statement I wish to express the view that this session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success and that our common endeavours will contribute to reinforcing peace and increasing prosperity throughout our planet. The Turkish delegation pledges to co-operate with you  Mr. President  and to do its part to secure that outcome."
"143",7057,"TZA",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of my delegation I should like to extend to the President my sincere congratulations on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. He brings to his high office a wealth of knowledge and rich experience as an international jurist and seasoned diplomat - qualities that will prove useful during his tenure. In welcoming his election my delegation pledges him its fullest co-operation.I also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria  for the style  efficiency and understanding with which he presided over the Assembly at its forty-fourth session. He has reason to be proud of a superb performance  and all of us are indebted to him for what was without question a very productive session under his guidance.The United Nations has continued to benefit from the wise and dedicated leadership of its Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. We  more than any other single individual  has borne the burden of overseeing the maintenance of international peace and security even when it seemed a thankless task to do so  as was the case with his most recent mission to the Gulf. In the past year we have witnessed his untiring efforts take him to several lands in behalf of peace  conducting delicate negotiations and undertaking very difficult missions. Tanzania wishes to renew its support for the Secretary-General and for the Organization he so well serves.My delegation is happy to join other delegations in extending to the Principality of Liechtenstein a warm welcome to the family of nations. Its admission brings us a step closer to the ultimate goal of universality in the membership of the Organization.The eyes of the whole world are quite rightly focused on the latest crisis in the Gulf. There have been few developments in recent years that have so united and galvanized the international community into a common resolve for action as Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait. One reason is clearly that the act that has precipitated the crisis is so out of step with the mood of the times. It is ironic that at a time when relations between the super-Powers have improved dramatically and a new era of co-operation has been ushered in  the world should have been plunged into such a dangerous situation. The invasion and annexation are also an affront to the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and of the peaceful settlement of disputes  which unequivocally rejects the threat or use of force to settle differences between States. Tanzania has joined the rest of the world in condemning the invasion and in calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's forces from Kuwait and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome the speed with which the Security Council has responded to the crisis and wish to reaffirm our belief that sanctions are a proper response to this act of aggression.As a sequel to the invasion a massive build-up of forces has taken place in the Gulf. Thousands upon thousands of troops from at least a dozen countries are ready to go to war at a moment's notice. Although these troops are said to be there in response to Security Council resolutions  it is clear that they are neither under the United Nations flag and command nor  indeed  under any unified command. That situation  apart from anything else  should be a source of major concern for the international community. Yet even if that major flaw were rectified there is the larger question of war. The United Nations was founded in the wake of two major world wars. Its very existence stems from the rejection of war. It cannot condone or sanction war except in the most extreme of situations. The United Nations can sanction or condone war only when it is convinced that everything possible has been done to prevent war and there is absolutely no other option.War in the Gulf region is not inevitable. It is possible for the international community to pursue a vigorous policy of sanctions while encouraging the search for a peaceful end to the crisis. We therefore welcome recent indications from a number of important quarters that the door to a peaceful end to the crisis has not been closed. The Security Council has a responsibility to follow up these signals  and we urge it to do so. We hope it will find it possible to encourage the Secretary-General to resume his mission for a diplomatic outcome to the crisis. Tanzania is convinced that the international community has not yet crossed the Rubicon. The point of no return in the search for a diplomatic solution to the crisis has not yet been reached.At this point  it is fitting to welcome the speed with which the Security Council has acted over this matter. It would be most heartening to know that such speed and resolve will be manifested when in the future the Council is confronted with similar threats to peace and security. This has not happened in the case of efforts to enforce the arms embargo against the racist regime in South Africa. The readiness with which the major Western Powers have moved to secure mandatory sanctions by the Security Council is in sharp contrast to their repeated use of the veto to protect that regime. If this is not a case of double standards  what is it?The Gulf crisis has  unfortunately  distracted attention from the Palestinian question. The plight and suffering of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories  which have never been given the attention they deserve  have now been relegated to the back burner by the present crisis in the region. If the faith  trust and confidence of the Palestinian people in the United Nations and in the solidarity of the international community are to be sustained  we must remain seized of their plight. It therefore remains the responsibility of this Organisation to continue the search for a solution for the Palestinian question  which has for so long eluded the international community. In this connection  an international conference on peace in the Middle East should be convened without further delay. The major Powers with influence in the region  particularly the United States  have a major responsibility to see to it that the convening of the conference is not further undermined. The unprecedented unity of purpose demonstrated by the permanent members of the Security Council in response to the Gulf crisis and to other situations should help in the search for a lasting solution for the explosive situation in the Middle East.The fratricidal conflict in Liberia  which has caused tremendous devastation to human life and property  is a matter of the gravest concern to my delegation. Tanzania has all along encouraged and supported the mediation efforts of the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity and its Secretary General and the initiative of the Economic Community of West African States. We appeal to the people of Liberia and the parties to the conflict to come together and agree on future action which will restore peace to Liberia and preserve the unity and territorial integrity of that country.My delegation is delighted that we have in our midst the delegation of a free and independent Namibia. Namibia’s membership in the United Nations is a victory for its Members and the international community as a whole. Another historic victory over colonialism and racism  Namibia's accession to independence on 21 March this year has meant more than the end of a bitter struggle for the people of Namibia. By pushing the frontiers of freedom in Africa to the doorstep of the apartheid regime  it has been a source of inspiration in the struggle against apartheid itself. Namibia is no longer a springboard for the subversion of neighbouring independent African countries. Instead it has now joined hands with Angola  Zambia  Botswana and others in the front line  and in the larger family of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference  to build new relationships of co-operation for mutual benefit.Unfortunately  the hope we all expressed at the start last year of the process in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) that Namibia's independence would help to create a climate conducive to a resolution of the conflict in Angola  has not materialised. Despite the best endeavours of the Angolan Government  the end of the conflict is not yet in sight. Encouraged by the support  both covert and overt  given by the United States and other allies  UNITA remains intransigent. Savimbi has become very adept at moving the goal posts  as evidenced by his attempt to rewrite the Gbadolite Agreement almost as soon as he had appended his signature to it. If his contradictory statements prove anything  it is that Savimbi is not a free agent. External interference thus remains the most serious obstacle to reconciliation and peace in Angola.External interference applies also to the conflict in Mozambique  which we had hoped would also benefit from the relinquishment by the Pretoria regime of its hold on Namibia. The regime's past involvement with RENAMO makes its present denials difficult to believe. What is more  we are dealing with a regime whose track record of respect for the truth we are all too familiar with. In any event  it cannot declare responsibility for acts committed from its territory or by its agents  even if it has not sanctioned such activities.In regard to South Africa itself  we acknowledge that there have been positive developments over the past year. The release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANCSA) and other political parties and organisations  the lifting of the state of emergency in three out of four provinces and the repeal of some obnoxious pieces of legislation represent some of the measures which the world community has been demanding for a long time.We acknowledge also that the talks between the ANC and the Pretoria regime represent an important movement on the part of the regime. In this regard we acknowledge that  unlike his predecessors. De Klerk has demonstrated some political courage. But do not let us dramatise his personal contribution or the achievements of his much vaunted reform programme. The talks with the ANC are no more than ""talks about talks"". Substantive negotiations have yet to start  and their ultimate goal  as far as the regime is concerned  remains unclear. The other measures are no more than the first tentative steps at the start of a long and arduous journey. The Declaration adopted at the sixteenth special session of the General Assembly in December last year laid down five pre-conditions which the regime has to satisfy to prepare the ground for substantive negotiations. As the Secretary-General observed in his report  only one of the five pre-conditions - that is  the one calling for the unbanning of political parties and organizations - has been fully met  and even this has had its positive effects negated by the deliberate application of laws which restrict free speech  movement and assembly. The Declaration laid down a two-stage process for the dismantlement of the apartheid system. The first stage entails the creation by the regime of an atmosphere conducive to negotiations. The second stage entails the adoption  again by the regime  of measures which together constitute the ""profound and irreversible change"" foreseen in the Declaration as a condition for the lifting of sanctions. Despite all the talk and optimism generated by the consensus Declaration  we are still at the beginning of stage one of its implementation.Sanctions were imposed to compel the regime to abandon apartheid. This evil system is buttressed by a body of laws which have become commonly known collectively as the pillars of apartheid. They include the Land Act  the Population Registration Act  the Group Areas Act  the Bantu Education Act  the tricameral parliament legislation and the legislation parcelling up the country into Bantustans. Clearly  no change which leaves this system intact can be described as profound and irreversible.Thus  it is premature to shower praise on De Klerk  and most unwise and imprudent to reward him. My delegation is therefore heartened by the reaffirmation by the Assembly at its resumed forty-fourth session last month of its commitment to upholding sanctions. We very much hope that those who have broken ranks by relaxing sanctions will reconsider their decision so as to align themselves  not with the oppressor  but with his victims.There is an additional reason for maintaining sanctions: they have been instrumental in compelling the apartheid regime to accept the principle of negotiations. It is sanctions that  combined with other pressures  have brought the struggle this far  and it is sanctions that will keep Pretoria at the negotiating table. The world community must therefore continue to maintain sanctions and other pressures on the South African regime so as to force the regime to implement the provisions of the United Nations Declaration.In our resolution adopted a fortnight ago  we all agreed  by consensus  that the escalating violence in Natal and elsewhere traced its roots largely to the continued existence of apartheid  its policies  practices and structures  and that it was also instigated by elements opposed to the democratic transformation of South Africa. We specifically called for effective and impartial action by the security forces  because the evidence implicating the regime's security forces in encouraging and abetting the violence  in order to delay the process  is overwhelming.The maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the Pretoria regime. The manner in which it has ignored the calls to intervene to contain the violence puts into question its commitment to put an end to the killings. My delegation hopes that the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other anti-apartheid groups will work together and jointly exert pressure on the regime to put an end to this carnage  but this will only succeed if the South African authorities agree to contain and put an end to Inkatha's acts of violence as well as the acts of violence and lawlessness of the ultra-right elements of the white community which shelter in the police and armed forces.We are greatly encouraged by the outcome of the efforts of the Secretary-General on the question of Western Sahara  which have resulted in the approval of the peace plan by the Security Council  We are particularly gratified that the plan provides for the holding of a referendum which will enable the people of Western Sahara to determine their future without military constraints. My delegation hopes the Secretary-General will continue to offer his good offices for that objective.Tanzania is equally encouraged by the improved political situation in Central America. The new spirit of reconciliation and the sense of unity among the countries of the region offer new hope for a future of stability  national unity  and co-operation for the region. We call upon the international community to give whole-hearted support to regional efforts and  above all  to desist from any action that could undermine the implementation of the Esquipulas agreement  which holds so much promise for future relations between the countries of the region. We are encouraged by the opening of a dialogue between the leaders of North and South Korea  which we hope will lead to the realisation of the desire of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their homeland and its eventual admission to the United Nations.With regard to Cambodia  we hold the widely shared optimism that a solution to the conflict is no longer a distant cry. In this respect  we welcome the agreement on a framework for a comprehensive political settlement based on an enhanced role for the United Nations.We follow with interest the changes taking place in Eastern Europe  which have so dramatically changed the whole gamut of international relations. Despite all the uncertainties and crises involved  these countries have embarked upon a process of radical transformation and democratisation of their societies. We welcome the ending of 45 years of partition of the two Germanys. It is our hope that the reunification of the two States and their replacement in the United Nations by & single Member will strengthen the Organisation and provided a new impetus to the United Nations role in the promotion of freedom and justice  the right to self-determination  respect for the principles of the Charter and the maintenance of international peace and security.We continue to follow closely the bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers on agreements to rid the world of the horrible weapons of mass destruction. We are disappointed that there have been no new agreements after the INF Treaty. We are disappointed that  even after going back on their commitment to a 50 per cent reduction in their strategic arsenals  agreement on the new target of a 30 per cent reduction has not yet been concluded. We are concerned that the major nuclear Powers remain indifferent to the dangers posed by the vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons or the export of nuclear-weapon capability to outlaws such as apartheid South Africa  while wasting precious time exerting pressure on countries with neither the desire nor the resources to acquire nuclear-weapon capability. Their reluctance to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty puts into question their commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. A comprehensive test-ban treaty cannot by itself reverse the arms race  but the race cannot be halted without a test baa. For Tanzania  a comprehensive test ban thus remains an objective deserving of the highest priority in the nuclear disarmament negotiation effort.In a world of multifaceted problems  threats to world peace and security  and hunger and poverty  afflict all mankind. Their impact on the third world assumes immense proportions. The decade of the 1980s has provided all of us with experiences that may enable us to confront the future with a sense of realism. The 1980s were a time when most developing countries experienced stagnant or negative rates of economic growth  and declining real per capita incomes. The improved international political climate has not alleviated the difficult conditions resulting from the debt crisis. The prices of most of their primary commodities are still depressed  and there are no signs of any price improvements in the near future. Protectionist measures by most of the developed countries are on the increase. Unless international co-operation for development is reinvigorated  the 1990s may well turn out to be a decade of frustrated expectations and worsening living standards and social conditions for the majority of the population of the developing world. Nowhere perhaps is this more true than in sub-Saharan Africa  where poverty is widespread. A few months ago  the General Assembly met in a special session devoted to international economic co-operation. From this podium  speaker after speaker underscored the fact that for most developing countries  particularly the least developed countries  which includes Tanzania  the 1980s was a lost decade for their development. In contrast  the developed countries and a handful of developing countries enjoyed a prolonged period of steady growth and unprecedented levels of accumulated wealth. While some of the national economic policies might not have been conducive to economic growth and development  the situation was further exacerbated by a very hostile international economic environment brought about by such factors as trade imbalances  inaccessibility to world markets  declining capital flows and external indebtedness.External indebtedness has had a devastating effect on the economic growth and development of the developing countries. The debt-servicing obligation has threatened the very survival of our people  whose living standards have been continuously deteriorating  threatening the political stability of many countries. The debt crisis has particularly weighed heavily on low-income countries.All measures undertaken so far to address the debt crisis have aimed at protecting the creditors. This policy has resulted in creditor countries and financial institutions refraining from committing additional financial resources to most debtor countries at a time of a continuous net transfer of resources from the developing debtor countries to creditor countries and institutions. Recent initiatives  including the Toronto Initiative and the Brady Plan  have proved inadequate and discriminatory in their application. They should be made available to all debtor countries and should cover all types of debts  including those owed to the multilateral financial institutions. It remains to be seen whether the ""Trinidad Terms"" have addressed these concerns. No one is philosophically opposed to structural adjustment programmes. Their objective  after all  is to promote economic growth and development.Unfortunately  all too often they have imposed unacceptable social costs. It is heartening to see that the need to take special measures to ameliorate the impact of these programmes on the vulnerable sections of the population has now become generally accepted by creditor countries and institutions.Tanzania accepts that economic growth and development and a sound environmental policy are inseparable. For this reason  it will continue to accord high priority to and actively participate in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the whole for the preparation of the 1992 Environment Conference in Brazil.In a global economy  interdependence among the developing countries and between the developing and developed countries is a reality that cannot be ignored. The problems I have underlined can be adequately addressed only if co-operation exists among and between the various groups of countries. In this respect  the persisting commodity problems of the developing countries  particularly in Africa  caused by the continued deterioration in their terms of trade  which has resulted in the sharp reduction in the export earnings of these countries  should be accorded high priority. The removal of various protectionist and discriminatory measures in order to allow access to the markets of the developed countries  not only for raw materials  but also for semi-processed and manufactured products from the developing countries  is another priority area.That is why  in the current Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations  the developing countries are demanding more liberal and secure conditions of access to the markets of the developed countries for their products. This can be achieved only if tariffs end non-tariff measures  as well as efforts aimed at strengthening multilateral rules  principles and disciplines are all geared towards reducing the possibilities for restriction on  or harassment for the trade of the developing countries.The development of the economies of the developing countries  individually or collectively  cannot be achieved under the existing harsh international economic environment. An improved international economic environment is a prerequisite for the development of the world economy. That is why the collapse of the North-South dialogue is such a shame. It is our hope that  besides encouraging South-South co-operation  the report of the South Commission will also help to revive and breathe new life into the North-South dialogue.The launching of the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade will greatly contribute to the realization of a global and balanced world economy that we all aim to achieve. In this regard  Tanzania hopes that the difficulties encountered in the ongoing negotiations on the strategy will soon be overcome.The mood of the times offers us opportunities as well as challenges. The world is endowed with enough resources to feed the hungry  clothe the naked  shelter the homeless - in short  there are enough resources to eliminate poverty. Equally  there is no lack of good ideas about solutions to intractable political problems. Recent events have demonstrated that nothing is insurmountable when there is political will."
"144",7100,"UGA",45,1990,"﻿In 1967  I had the privilege of addressing this Assembly at its forty-second session and I took the opportunity at that time to apprise members of this body of our struggles in Uganda.This time I have come wearing two hats  so to speak. Today  I speak on behalf of the States members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  as its current Chairman  for which I feel greatly honoured  and also as President of my country  Uganda. We in Africa enter this decade with a deep sense of history. We vividly remember that the nineteenth century vas characterised by the climax of the partition and colonisation of our continent. Despite our problems  which I shall address presently  the twentieth century is closing just as Africa has recovered its political freedom. We brace ourselves as we look forward to making the twenty-first century one of memorable progress  when Africa becomes a continent of modern States. This calls for the confronting of all the problems of under-development - a task that is surely a global responsibility  a responsibility of all the countries in the United Nations.Today  I should like to focus on the strategies for the economic and political emancipation of our continent and on the role that the international community can play in resolving these problems. In this regard  I see five fundamental obstacles to Africa's economic and political advancements first  human-resource under-development  particularly under-development in science and technical training; secondly  the excessive and unbearable debt burden of the world's poorest nations; thirdly  rigidity and distortions in Africa's external trade  especially with the industrial countries; fourthly  rigidity and distortions in the influence of fiscal and monetary policy  especially in relation to multilateral financial institutions; fifthly  rigidity and corruption in the political and economic institutions of African States.On the question of the under-development of human resources  it is important to note that the role of scientific discovery  invention and innovation in economic development has been fully recognized in recent economic history. Few would dispute the catalytic role of the steam engine  the aeroplane  the telephone and  more recently  the computer  in advancing the economic and social welfare of vast communities world-wide. Less well recognised  however  are the infrastructures that make these inventions possible. There is no doubt that active and sustained participation in scientific and technical work requires a well organised and adequately funded educational establishment. Technology cannot be meaningfully advanced by  or transferred to people who can neither read nor write.Fundamentally  Africa recognizes that economic production is conceived  planned and implemented by people acting in their capacities as farmers  processors  traders  engineers and managers. While the various roles that individuals play in a production process require varying levels of literacy and technical training  there is no doubt that improvements in production require improvements in the knowledge and skills of human beings. Attempts to increase the utilisation of tractors  for example  will not succeed where a country lacks trained mechanics to maintain them. Thus  expensive machines lie idle because skilled manpower is lacking.Similarly  technology transfers from industrial countries to developing countries necessitate the poorer countries' maintaining a progressive and sustained educational effort so that the population may acquire the capacity to receive  absorb and improve upon the technologies. This is an essential component of the development process in African countries and in other nations of the world. Such training inevitably necessitates the commitment of real resources in the immediate term. There is no doubt whatsoever that Africa's fundamental development predicament today is the desperate lack of real resources to support the level of educational effort that is needed if the continent is to reach the development threshold.The most fundamental change in the economies of Europe - the industrialrevolution - was essentially a revolution of the middle class  the bourgeoisie. It was a self-sustaining process of economic growth whereby each succeeding generation expected to enjoy  and did enjoy  higher levels of production and consumption. No genuine  indigenous middle class - no captains of industry  as they were called in another continent and in another century - has emerged in Africa. Instead  we behold the spectacle of a class of middlemen who act as commission agents for foreign manufacturers. These are the people we call Africa's middle class.No economy will transform itself without the emergence of an indigenous class of industrialists and entrepreneurs. The cause of development will be best served by the deliberate encouragement  from within and from without  of the emergence of an African force to equal the industrial middle class  such as the one that accomplished the transformation of the economies of Western Europe and the rest of the developed northern hemisphere.There is no doubt in my mind that if Africa is to develop  it must devote a greater share of its current income to the education of its people. Africa should also solicit and welcome substantial concessionary loans and grants to aid the education sector. Above all  what Africa must not do - can no longer afford to do - is continue to substitute debt servicing for education. In Uganda  for example  the proportion of the Government's recurrent budget that will go to debt servicing this year is more than twice that which is earmarked for education. This debt servicing  moreover  will use up more than 80 per cent of our foreign-exchange earnings. By any standard  such a burden on an economy whose disintegration over the past 30 years is well known illustrates that the international arrangements that have so far been devised to assist the world's poor nations to reach levels of self-sustained development continue to be grossly inadequate.We believe that the objective of self-sustaining growth and development should not be sacrificed at the altar of debt servicing. We appeal to all members of this Organization to give their full support to debt-forgiveness and debt-rescheduling proposals  to ensure that the necessary resources are available to educate Africa's populations so that they may be enabled to attain higher productive capacity. I understand  from current data  that there are 26 severely indebted low-income countries  of which 24 are in sub-Saharan Africa. Ï am further informed that in 1986 the debts of these low-income countries amounted to 135 per cent of their gross national product. It is evident that they cannot pay such debts. At best they will service them by undermining their own economies  thus becoming less capable  in each successive year  of repaying debts. It is clearly in the interests of both debtors and creditors to reverse such an absurd and dangerous situation.In the light of these problems  I commend the initiatives that have been advanced for the writing-off of debts. I must point out  however  that  so far the actual relief resulting from these programmes is extremely small. For example  until recently the cash-flow savings for 12 sub-Saharan countries in the special programme of assistance in 1989 were about $50 million  or 2 per cent of their debt-service burden. However  the recent announcement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in Trinidad is most welcome. It is evident that a great deal more must be done to break the grip of debt on Africa's economic progress.I turn now to the subject of international trade.For Africa  as for all the world  free and fair trade is vital to economic progress. It is well known that our countries have suffered greatly from deteriorating terms of trade as well as from protectionism in the developed countries. The values of coffee and cocoa have plummeted to unprecedented levels  causing many African countries to totter on the brink of chaos  which can be avoided only by abdicating independence to external institutions and donor countries. Our protests against imperfect and distorted markets which consistently raise the prices of the products of industrial countries while invariably reducing the value of our products  manufactured as well as primary  have fallen on deaf ears. We are now at a point where the value of our products has deteriorated to a fraction of what it was a few years ago  and tariff barriers on our processed products make it extremely difficult for us to penetrate the markets of the industrialised countries.It is clear that the industrialized countries need to pay more than lip service to the doctrines of market economics. The advocacy of the market economy so generously preferred by the media and vigorously reinforced by the multilateral institutions would be more easily accepted if the international markets for our products were actually free and fair. It is incredibly insensitive to insist that we should obey the laws of the market when the only sure result so far is that these markets have consistently devalued our products. We therefore urge this Organization to inquire yet more actively into the conduct of world markets and to reduce the rigidities and distortions which operate against developing countries’ products. It is not at all inconceivable that the illegal practices which have recently been found in some stock exchanges and commodity markets may be more widespread than is generally believed.I do not wish to blame the international situation for all of Africa's problems. I do recognize that there has also been a failure of policy in African countries. Overvalued exchange rates  large fiscal deficits  hyperinflation and negative interest rates have often led to instability and deterioration in many African economies. While we acknowledge these problems  we also wish to urge the multilateral institutions to recognize Africa's need for long-term structural change as opposed to lop-sided  rigid emphasis on short-term stabilization. Recent pronouncements from the World Bank indicate that they are beginning to orient future lending towards long-term development. We welcome this shift  and urge both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to complement each other's policies in order to promote genuine structural change in the African economies.I wish to take this opportunity to clarify and reiterate our stand on political freedom. As the twentieth century draws to a close  Africans look back on it as the century in which most African countries regained political freedom from the colonial masters. For many of our countries - for example  Namibia Angola  Mozambique and Zimbabwe - the wounds are still raw. As for South Africa  we are living through a continuous wake for the victims of apartheid.Therefore  Africans know what freedom means. There have been various aborted 'democratic processes. This is because management of the democratic process itself was new to the continent. What previous experience did Africans have of managing a democratic process? It was during precisely those centuries in which Europe and North America were emerging from feudalism towards - for some of them at least - liberal democracy that Africa was being ravaged by the slave trade and  later on  lost its sovereignty altogether. Because of colonial rule and the plunder of Africa in the preceding period  social forces which could sustain democracy had not emerged by the time of independence. In Europe  liberal democracy was and is the ideology of the industrial middle class and of the small  independent artisans before them. Where was the industrial middle class of Africa 30 years ago  during the twilight of colonialism? Despite these impediments  the democratic movement in Africa is on the forward march. An authentic democratic movement is being consolidated by internal  social dynamic? External sermonising and pressure will not bring democracy to Africa.In this regard  however  we take exception to the view that the mode of democracy practised in a select group of countries is the only legitimate democracy. We find considerable danger and paradox in the attempt to prescribe  in a virtually dictatorial  intolerant fashion  a brand of democracy which is ready-made and presumed to be the only correct one. I wish to urge the people of the world to agree that the cause of democracy would be better served by accepting pluralism  not only within the borders of a given State but also throughout the world. In this way  international democracy will emerge as an acceptance of multiple approaches to political freedom by the various peoples of the world. If the fundamental basis of democracy is the tolerance of alternative views within a given economy  then the logical extension of this concept to the international level is the tolerance of alternative perceptions of democratic freedom by different cultures. The acceptance of cultural variety is  in our view  not inconsistent with the yearning for universal human freedom  nor is it an escape mechanism by which tyrants can impose dictatorships on their peoples. It is simply a recognition of the fundamental forces at work in different parts of the world at different times. Nevertheless  the principles that form the essence of democracy are not negotiable. These are: accountability to the population; regular elections; a free press; universal suffrage; and unrestricted entry into the political process by those seeking election to leadership roles. These form the essence of democracy; the forms  however  may differ  and this is legitimate.Africa is faced with a special challenge in the remainder of this century.That challenge is the conquest of economic underdevelopment and the emancipation of all African peoples from political servitude. In my remarks to the Assembly today  I have touched on some of the major obstacles to the attainment of these objectives. We believe that this Organization has a role to play in their realization.Let me therefore take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the United Nations  and our confidence in the capacity and willingness of the world community to assist Africa's quest for economic and political freedom. In this connection  I would recall the special session of the General Assembly on 1 June 1986; at which the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 was unanimously adopted. That historic session witnessed the forging of a unique compact and coalition between Africa aid the international community to accelerate socio-economic recovery and development in Africa. Unfortunately  that global coalition has not been sustained as the crisis in Africa  rather than abating  has become worse. A final review of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 will be conducted at the forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Searching questions must be asked and an in-depth assessment must be conducted at that session on the fate of the 1986 consensus  the impact it has had on bringing about economic recovery and development  and the extent to which all parties to this historic alliance have honoured the commitments contained in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990.Based on that final review and evaluation the General Assembly will also need to pronounce itself on the measures that need to be undertaken to support a process of sustained growth and transformation in Africa in the post-Programme period.It is therefore imperative that the final review of the implementation of the United Nations Programme and support for African development and transformation endeavours in the 1990s should be conducted. The Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has recommended that mechanisms for the final review and appraisal of the implementation of the Programme should be similar to those of the mid-term review of the Programme  and that for this purpose an ad hoc committee of the whole of the General Assembly should be established to appraise the Programme and to propose measures for sustained development in Africa beyond 1991. The Organisation of African Unity endorses this recommendation and hopes that the necessary resources will be made available to the ECA to carry out the review exercise. The current session of the General Assembly has been entrusted with the task of establishing the mechanism for the final review of the Programme. It is my sincere hope that the Assembly will concur in the proposals that have been put to it by Africa.In conclusion  first I request that  a special effort be mounted by the world community  through this Organization  to increase resources for investment in education in Africa. That is one of the surest ways to lay the foundation for the scientific and technical revolution which Africa must now accomplish in order to bring about self-sustaining development.Secondly  I call upon Africa's creditors  including the multilateral institutions  to adopt realistic attitudes that are effectively compatible with Africa's long-term development and growth.Thirdly  I must make a special appeal to all Members of this Organisation to re-examine the conduct of international trade  so that it is free and fair to all participating countries. The time is long overdue for reversing the decline in the terms of trade of the developing countries.Fourthly  I urge the multilateral institutions to adopt more flexible macro-economic policies which recognise the limits of current economic knowledge and which emphasise long-term development and not merely short-term stabilization.Fifthly  I reiterate that the Organisation of African Unity fully accepts the objectives of popular democracy. Our Organization will continue to encourage its members to create an environment for freedom and democracy in every African country. We recognize that there are too many - and in some cases protracted - internecine struggles in Africa today. Liberia is a recent and very tragic example. These conflicts are also  more often than not  funded by outside interests. Our continent cannot prosper if these struggles continue. We appeal to the international community to support peace and to eschew destabilisation in Africa  a peaceful Africa will ultimately serve and enhance the cause of global peace.In this regard I must emphasize the obligation of all member countries to intensify pressure upon the apartheid regime in South Africa to hasten the end of that affront to humanity. The sanctions against South Africa are being felt by the racist regime. They should therefore be tightened in order to force South Africa to abandon apartheid at once. The Africans in South Africa itself have expressed support for sanctions as a means of forcing the racists to abandon apartheid. It is therefore incorrect to maintain the view that sanctions are wrong because presumably they hurt the black majority. The view of the black majority is that they want the sanctions. If we are truly interested in assisting them we should respect their views on this important matter. Those who doubt the efficacy of sanctions must now reassess their positions in the light of the current position elsewhere in the world. If sanctions can work in Iraq they can work in South Africa.Finally  I should like to call on the United Nations system to implement the United Nations resolutions on the Middle East and the Gulf. We cannot talk about freedom in the rest of the world and forget the people of Kuwait and the people of Palestine.We reaffirm the right of all countries to determine  in all sovereignty  their system of democracy on the basis of their socio-cultural values  taking into account the realities of our countries  the necessity to ensure development and to satisfy the basic needs of our peoples. We therefore assert that democracy and development should go together and should be mutually reinforcing. "
"145",7147,"UKR",45,1990,"﻿At the outset  I should like to congratulate you Sir  on your election to this important post and express our confidence that your vast and diversified experience and political sagacity will contribute to the success of this august international forum and enhance the prestige of your country  Malta  with whose representatives we enjoy an excellent relationship.  As one of the countries that signed the Charter of the United Nations at San Francisco 45 years ago  the Ukrainian SSB warmly welcomes Namibia and the Principality of Liechtenstein among the States Members of the Organisation.  Despite all the complexities and contradictions of today's political processes  the dominant trend in world events is that of radical positive changes and transformations. Today's world is a boundless field full not with modest and barely noticeable sprouts of vegetation but with young shoots which are already growing and gaining strength and which we call the new political thinking. Rapid changes and momentous events have swept the world. We are witnessing a historic departure from military confrontation in Europe and a transformation of military-political alliances into political organisations working towards constructive interaction. Vow opportunities are opening for contacts and co-operation.The new  post-confrontational reality has an international as well as a national dimension. The transformation and democratisation of all aspects of the life of the Ukrainian people have provided the impetus for a national and spiritual revival. This will lead to the destruction of the barriers of ideological and political alienation that as recently as yesterday estranged us from other nations and from Ukrainians living abroad. Today Ukrainians  wherever they are  can satisfy their national yearning for their historic homeland and fulfil their cultural  linguistic  religious and spiritual aspirations. Thus outmoded stereotypes and clichés are disappearing  giving way to interaction and co-operation that can strengthen universal human values.The Ukrainian SSR welcomes the active participation of the United Nations in the processes of global renewal. We pay tribute to the peace-making efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. The role played by the United Nations has been dramatically changed. At this new stage we see the Organisation as a sort of collective decision-making body promoting the harmonious development of an integrated and interdependent world.The ongoing intensification of the process being carried out within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) is crucial for strengthening international peace and security. The Ukraine views with hope and optimism the important changes in European international relations  which are described in the Secretary-General's report to the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly as representing the choice for peace. Those changes will no doubt facilitate the development of good-neighbourly and friendly relations and broad co-operation between all the countries of Europe.The unification of the two German States has become possible in the contest of Europe's movement towards a common European home. That is a trend we intend to promote. The Ukraine seeks to increase its contribution to the international life of Europe.The 16 July 1990 declaration on national sovereignty adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic affirmed the Ukraine's intention to participate directly in the CSCE process and in European structures. We hope that our aspirations will be understood and supported by the international community and will be realised without delay.However  the positive changes taking place in international relations are net reason enough for ignoring the destructive treads that still persist on the international scene. This is perhaps the main conclusion of the present crucial period.Iraq's recent armed aggression against Kuwait is a throwback to the days of power politics. In this context our republic's Supreme Soviet has stated that the Ukrainian SSR regards the use of force as an unacceptable way of settling international disputes that are not caused by armed aggression. The sovereignty  national independence and territorial integrity of occupied Kuwait must be fully restored and safeguarded. The resolute steps taken by the Security Council  including the mandatory sanctions supported by the world community  have made it clear that under the new conditions the United Nations is capable of preventing war and halting aggression. The inexorable intensification of the sanctions should remove any temptation to plunge into military adventures. The United Nations of 1390 is capable of fully implementing the purposes of its Charter relating to the restoration of peace and justice.The Iraqi aggression has further aggravated the political situation in the Middle East. There is an urgent need to find quickly a political solution to the entire Middle East conflict  whose centre-piece is the problem of Palestine. In our view  an effective way to settle the conflict as a whole is to develop a dialogue on the implementation of the relevant United Nations decision through a peace conference bringing together all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the permanent members of the Security Council.A transition from bitter hostility to partnership in world politics can and must facilitate the search for just and equitable solutions to all regional conflicts without exception.The Government of the Ukrainian SSR has consistently held the view that all international conflicts and crises should be resolved by peaceful means at the negotiating table. We are convinced that the United Nations peace-making mechanism must be fully utilized for that purpose. This applies in full measure to the problems of Afghanistan and Cambodia  the settlement of the situations on the Korean peninsula and in Western Sahara  to the dismantling of apartheid and to other conflict situations. The construction of a fundamentally new  truly secure  democratic and civilised world will be feasible if all States work together to strengthen the comprehensive multidimensional security structure at progressively lower levels of military capability. The active participation of the United Nations in the disarmament process  which should cover all types of armaments and extend to all regions  therefore assumes high priority. Each country has a contribution to make to the strengthening of international security through bilateral and multilateral disarmament.We share the view that considerable progress has recently been achieved in this area  opening even greater prospects for the future One of the most important accomplishments has been the Soviet-United States dialogue on nuclear-arms control. Noteworthy results have been achieved. The elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear Missiles is nearly complete  and we hope that a treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons is within reach. All of this means that real nuclear disarmament has begun.However  a number or priority issues are yet to be resolved. Everyone in this hall is well aware that one of our most urgent disarmament objectives is a complete prohibition of all nuclear testing. In the opinion of the Ukrainian Government  one possible way to achieve an early solution of that problem is to extend the scope of the 1963 Moscow Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear testing in three environments to include underground testing. We expect the forthcoming 1991 Review Conference to give serious attention to that possibility. Such a solution could be greatly facilitated by a joint Soviet-United States moratorium on all nuclear explosions. To those in the United States who still question or deny the need for the complete cessation of nuclear testing  I want to say this you cannot even imagine the high moral and practical dividends that your country and its leaders would derive from responding positively to the world community's desire that this planet should finally be rid of nuclear explosions.We also propose starting substantive talks on the prohibition of the production of fissionable materials for weapons purposes.Another matter of concern is that there exist certain so-called nuclear- capable States  which have not abandoned the idea of going nuclear. The gravity of this problem became evident at the recent Von-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  the first one attended by a Ukrainian delegation. I wish to refer to a solemn declaration adopted by our Parliament stating the Ukraine's intention of becoming in the future a permanently neutral State which will not participate in any military alliances and will abide by the three non-nuclear principles  not to accept  produce or acquire nuclear weapons.The conclusion of Soviet-United States bilateral agreement on the destruction and non-production of chemical weapons has created the most important conditions for quickly finalising a multilateral convention on the complete prohibition and elimination of those weapons.The persistent danger of the militarisation of outer space continues to be a matter of serious concern. Other problems that call for speedy solutions include the limitation and reduction of naval activities and armaments  prevention of the spread of the most sophisticated types of weapons  and elimination of military presences sad bases maintained by one country in the territory of another.Another issue that has recently come sharply into focus is that of conversion  the planned shifting of military production and defence spending to civilian uses. What can we do to derive maximum benefits from conversion at minimal economic and social cost? This is a disturbing question for us all  On 26 September  the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr  B. D  Genscher  told the General Assembly:""The conversion of armaments factories to the production of civilian goods is a global task in the cause of peace. Ш are prepared to co-operate with any nation in this new and important field of international security."" (А/45/PV.e  pp. 19-20)	.I welcome this statement and wish to say the following: having been drawn  along with a divided Germany  into a burdensome arms race  we would now be truly glad to engage in practical co-operation with a united German State in the demilitarisation of industry.In reviewing the current political situation in the world  we must not overlook the economic parameters of international security. The development of world economic ties is not keeping pace with today's political realities. We are confronted with inequalities in economic development. In many regions of the world  living standards are still extremely low  and rising too slowly if at all.Worst among the problems faced by many countries  including the developing countries  are the lack or scarcity of resources for development purposes and the ever-growing foreign debt. A breakthrough must be achieved in the development of international co-operation and in adjusting it to the new world realities  if these and many other acute problems of international economic relations are to be resolved.The eighteenth special session of the General Assembly became a milestone in this field by proclaiming  in its Declaration  the achievement  of a new  global economic consensus. For us  the corner-stone of the Declaration is its support for the efforts of the East European States to implement drastic economic reforms and become integrated into the world economic system  inter alia  by joining international economic and financial institutions. Just as  not long ago  a common concern for the safety of space explorers made engineers provide for complete compatibility between the Soyuz and the Apollo spacecraft  so today  a common interest in international economic security dictates the integration of our economy into the world economic system.The law on economic independence adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament will help the Republic assume a role in international affairs that will match its political  economic  intellectual and cultural potential. In this connection  we attach great importance to establishing and expanding equal and mutually beneficial economic and trade relations both with our European neighbours and with all other countries willing to co-operate. The law provides equal legal protection for all forms of ownership  which is a major prerequisite for our transition to a market economy. Equal opportunities will be created for the development of all forms of entrepreneurship. This will encourage competition and prevent monopolies. In general  we are engaged in a search for an efficient economic model which would remove artificial constraints and set free the creative potential of individuals.We are now going through a difficult period of transition and dealing with a complex social situation. Economic problems are worsening  and political passions are running high. At this extraordinary time  when the Ukraine is asserting its sovereignty  national statehood and economic independence  the Government is concentrating its efforts on preventing economic disintegration and a further decline in living standards. We are working very hard to deal with specific problems and achieve tangible results more rapidly. The Government is taking further steps to protect the people's interests by economic measures  tax policies and other available means. The economic hardships in the Ukraine  whose entire territory has become an environmental disaster area  are being exacerbated by environmental problems. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl tragedy  the Ukraine has an important stake in the efforts to formulate  at the 1992 Conference in Brazil  a strategy for the survival of our planet. Ws look forward to co-operation for greater international environmental protection based on the constructive interaction of all countries in dealing with environmental problems. Building an environmentally clean world is becoming a priority for the United Nations.The World Summit for Children has made it clear that a decisive factor affecting the environmental health of our planet and the physical health of generations to come will be our ability to place the advances of science and technology at the service of mankind. Technological progress in and of itself may become either a bridge to the future or a road to extinction. Only the deliberate internationalisation of technological achievements and the exchange of production methods that are safe for the environment and beneficial to mankind can pave the way to the early attainment of improved levels of industrial activity. One manifestation of the new approach is the contribution the United Nations and its specialised agencies are making to co-operation in mitigating the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. The consensus resolution on this subject adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its second regular session of 1990 is a major show of solidarity and international concern over the situation in Byelorussia  the Ukraine and certain parts of Russia. The resolution was an expression of willingness to provide the victims with assistance not subject to any ideological or bloc-membership constraints. Let me convey the sincere gratitude of the Government and people of the Ukraine to all the States Members of the United Nations and to all the collective and individual donors too supported us in that trying hour.It is a source of great moral encouragement for our people that  in these times of hardship in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster  the united nations of the world stand by them. I urge the General Assembly to live up to the hopes of those who have suffered and to adopt a resolution on assistance and co-operation to be provided by the specialised agencies of the United Nations system in overcoming the ravages of the Chernobyl disaster  I wish to inform you that the Ukraine has decided to freeze the construction of new nuclear power plants and to close down the one at Chernobyl. In co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and with the States concerned  an international research centre is being set up in the Chernobyl area. As we mobilise billions in funds and the Ukraine's entire scientific and technological potential for programmes to eliminate the effects of the disaster  we hope that the world community too will participate in this effort.An important task in building new international security structures is to strengthen and develop humanitarian co-operation and to eradicate the remnants of confrontation in the socio-humanitarian and legal bodies of the United Nations  so as to free their work from ideology and focus it on effective results. The General Assembly’s adoption of the Political Declaration and the World Programme of Action at its seventeenth special session and its proclamation  on the initiative of the Ukraine  of the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse are  in our view  an indication that States are determined to achieve a breakthrough in fighting that social plaque.The Ukrainian SSR in prepared to take an active part in attaining the objectives of the United Nations Decade of International Law  for  as President François Mitterrand stated from this rostrum  ""indeed the time has come for the rule of international law.' For us  affirming the supremacy of international law goes hand in hand with building a democratic State based on the rule of law.We are becoming convinced that more can be done to help mankind see itself as a global community imbued with the humanitarian spirit  and not as a conglomeration of un-cooperative nations  through uniform human-rights standards implemented by democratic States in which the rule of law prevails and through the affirmation of universal values than by anything else.These conclusions are supported  inter alia  by the findings of the United Nations seminar on international human-rights standards held at Kiev last week by the United Nations Centre for Human Sights in co-operation with the Government of the Ukrainian SSS.The Ukraine would like to see appropriate human-rights standards harmoniously combined with guarantees of international security and greater international co-operation. Human rights  international security and co-operation form an indissoluble amalgam in international policy and practice that will ensure lasting peace and stable progress at this crucial time  when humanity is not only entering a new millennium  but also  we should like to believe  initiating a new historic stage of greater perfection.

"146",7193,"URY",45,1990,"﻿Since 1945 - when the United Nations was created in response to the clamour of peoples to preserve future generations from the scourge of war  to strengthen faith in fundamental human rights and to create the proper conditions for international coexistence characterised by greater justice and solidarity  thus laying the foundations for lasting peace - the General Assembly  the principal representative organ of the United Nations  has met each year to carry out  within the scope of its competence  the task of promoting  building and keeping peace. That is the first purpose of the United Nations and our paramount mission.For that reason  I must begin by referring to the situation that exists today in the Middle East. In these past few months the shadow of war has cast a tragic shadow over the international situation  which until then had seemed to be following a hopeful path. Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait precipitated the crisis that had been developing  and they pushed the world to the verge of an armed conflict of unforeseeable consequences.The response of the international community  through the Security Council  has been rapid and energetic. Uruguay condemns the grave violation of international law committed by Iraq and fully supports the decisions taken by the Council.By adopting this attitude  Uruguay is demonstrating once again its unconditional respect for and adherence to international law for the sake of peace  whatever may be the negative consequences for its economy and its development process. We must be fully aware that the aggression committed has already created chaos in the world economy. Through the subsequent increase in oil prices  it has brought about a general crisis of extremely serious consequences for the whole of the international community  especially for non-oil-producing countries.Moreover  we must bear in mind that war would only worsen this crisis and its consequences would be unforeseeable. Considering the characteristics of modern war and - unlike other examples from the past - no State would benefit from it. This is true  dramatically true  in the case of small developing countries with weak and vulnerable economies.In the specific case of Uruguay its import and export trade has suffered precisely quantifiable damages as a direct consequence of the conflict and of the sanctions adopted. It has therefore sought consultations  as provided for in Article 50 of the Charter.The Gulf crisis has tested the Organisation's ability to face situations that jeopardise peace and security. The United Nations has emerged from this test triumphant and stronger. It has ceased to be held hostage to the rivalries of the cold war  and this fact has allowed the Security Council to adopt resolutions which constitute the most extraordinary demonstration of political co-operation in its 45 years of history.When Governments - and particularly those of Member States  which as such have greater responsibilities - decide to comply with and enforce the principles of the Charter  the United Nations becomes an appropriate and effective instrument ¿or restoring order  security and law.The most important achievement of international law is the principle of the prohibition of the use of force by States in their international relations. Only this Organisation is entitled to make use of force - within the limits provided in the Charter - except with the exception of the provisional authorisation granted to States in case of self-defence. It is by the application of this system and by the observance of other fundamental principles of contemporary international law - and as the right of peoples to self-determination  the principle of non-intervention; and the sovereign equality of States - that the existence of all States and dele . against aggression are ensured.The Gulf crisis has demonstrated two facts of particular significance the solidarity of the international community in responding to aggression end its confidence in the international security mechanisms of the United Nations. This reassessment of the current role of the Organisation at a time of profound and rapid change  gives us cause for optimism about its future  in spite of the undeniable gravity of the present situation in the Gulf.The United Nations is by its nature universal. Hence there is need for a process by which all States of the world can become Members of the Organisation  in this regard Uruguay welcomes the solution of the question of Namibia and in full participation of Namibia as a member of the United Nations. We must now focus our attention on the few remaining exceptions to the principle of universality  such as Korea. We are eager to see South Korea  and if possible North Korea as well  admitted to the United Nations.The admission of Liechtenstein to the Organisation is another notable step in the process towards full universality.The reunification of lessen and the reunification of Germany - the latter of which took place yesterday - are praiseworthy events. Considering that it entails the reunification of Germany must be saluted as a triumph of end the enshrinement of the will of a people. The events in the Persian Gulf rewind us of the vulnerability of peace when it is not based on a sys ten of international arms limitation and control  with the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament. Dividing walls may b· torn down; ideological confrontations may be mitigated; borders may be opened to communication and trade  the wings of democracy may fly over and destroy anachronistic authoritarian schemes  but no stable security or lasting peace will be attained as long as gigantic arsenals exist all over the world  ready to be used by any arbitrary and aggressive government.An armed world  one in which the great and the small furnish themselves with powerful and inhuman instruments of destruction and death  does not provide the proper framework for peace The events of the Gulf were possible because the States involved thought they were ensuring the effectiveness of their reckless acts through the support of excessive military power  resulting from an uncontrolled arms race.The international community must avoid the occurrence of similar dangerous situations in the future. That will be possible only if we accelerate the disarmament process. Uruguay understands that the immediate task in to concentrate on further advancing the regulation and limitation of armaments  whether conventional  nuclear  chemical  bacteriological  radiological or space weapons.The task must be carried out through the launching of new negotiations or acceleration of the current ones  the preparation of new conventions on the subject  the ratification of existing treaties by those States that have not yet done so; the creation of more nuclear-weapon free zones  and the improvement and strengthening of the misting ones  and the full establishment of zones of peace.The United Nations is the natural forum for the discussion of problems of disarmament and arms control. Naturally  the super-Powers have the major responsibilities in this regard. But there is no doubt that disarmament is a multilateral issue because the actions and the decisions of the super-Powers have an inevitable impact on the rest of the world.In this contest Uruguay attaches great importance to the declaration of the South Atlantic as a zone of peace and co-operation. It is a first basic step and it must be complemented with a sound legal statute for that region.At the same time we must undertake the promotion and diversification of procedures for the peaceful settlement of international conflicts. The history of international relations clearly shows that only political and jurisdictional solutions to international problems provide fair and lasting results that are respected by the parties. In the last few years many disputes have been settled - or are being settled - by political or diplomatic procedures  with the participation of the United Nations or other intergovernmental organisations. Conflicts such as those in southern Africa  Afghanistan  Central America  Iran-Iraq  Cambodia and Western Sahara have been or are being settled by negotiations based on the application of peaceful procedures.Together with political and diplomatic procedures  jurisdictional procedures for the settlement of disputes play a very important role. The increase in the number of cases submitted to the International Court of Justice is a very encouraging trend. However  of the 159 States that make up the international community  only 46 have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. In this Decade of International Law  Uruguay calls upon all States that have not yet done so to consider the possibility of subscribing to the optional clause in paragraph 2 of Article 36 of the Statute of the Court. It is true that the request made by the General Assembly in its resolution 3232 (3QCIX) has not had the positive effect expected. Uruguay considers that it has the right to make this appeal since it was the first country in the world to accept unreservedly the compulsory jurisdiction of  first  the Permanent Court of International Justice and  then  the International Court of Justice.The current political and military ¡conflicts cannot overshadow the fact that  even without them  there are menacing prospects in the present international situation. There are global threats that are not related to political or military issues  but are the result  on the one hand  of the persistence of underdevelopment in vast areas of the world and  on the other  of the fast pace of technological progress that have introduced revolutionary changes in our ways of life and methods of production and have had lethal consequences such as the depletion of natural resources  the degradation of the environment  drug trafficking and terrorism. The co-operation of all States is required to combat these new dangers of universal scope.One of the major challenges is the environmental issue. The international community has increased its awareness of this issue and is ready to react strongly against the ecological dangers to the planet. Uruguay is hopefully awaiting the Conference on Environment and Development  to be held in Brazil in 1992  and is committed to participating actively in the work of its preparatory commission as well as in the related actions under way at the international level. We trust that at the 1992 Conference agreements will be reached on strategies and measures to halt and reverse the effects of environmental degradation. Uruguay believes that these strategies  which must be applied immediately and with the firm political resolve required by the gravity of the dangers  must meet the following basic criteria: first  the principle of the inseparability of environmental and development material secondly  the principle of fairness in the distribution of responsibilities and burdens  which means that the expenses entailed in the protection of the environment and the restoration of the ecological balance must be borne by each State in accordance with the extent of its participation in the ecological deterioration and with its financial and technological capacities; thirdly  the principle of respect for national sovereignty as understood in international law in a world of interdependence and solidarity; fourthly  the principle of co-operation  which requires a special effort by the industrialised countries since they must provide the developing States with the financial resources and non-polluting technologies which they lack and which are indispensable if they are to face the environmental problems. Without the co-operation of the industrialised countries  the developing countries will be unable to shoulder their responsibilities in regard to protecting the environment  however strong their will to do so. Drug trafficking and terrorism  which are closely interrelated  are still taking a tragic toll in destruction and death  violating fundamental human rights  altering the basic principles of civilised coexistence and creating centres of disturbance of international security. To combat these two scourges we must use all possible forces of international co-operation.While there is deep concern over increasing drug abuse and the immense power of drug traffickers  it is encouraging to see that through international co-operation effective Measures are being adopted based on the acceptance of responsibilities by both consumer and producer countries. The latter have launched an open war that has earned deepest admiration and solidarity.These serious problems cannot be understood nor con a solution to then be found outside the framework of the enormous task the international community must undertake during the last decade of this century  namely  to bridge the immense gap dividing the human family and separating the world of affluence from the world of scarcity and under-development.It cannot be denied that true peace is not possible in a world that is economically divided. The General Assembly has recognised the priority that must be accorded to reactivating economic growth in the developing countries in order to ensure the right of every human being to live free from hunger  poverty  ignorance  disease and fear. Naturally  each State is responsible for finding its own path to economic prosperity and social progress.Uruguay is fully aware that the responsibility for its development rests fundamentally on its own efforts. In spite of the obstacles it faces  it has complied with its international obligations in a timely fashion it has implemented painful adjustment policies and the new government of President Luis Alberto Lacalle is devoting itself to the task of State reform  with the purpose of reducing bureaucracy and public expenditure and improving the efficiency of State-run services while simultaneously stipulating productive structures. As President Lacalle said when he took office on 1 March last  after as electoral victory that was an example of the traditional and currently sound and stable Uruguayan democracy:""The government and the state must be the first to change in order not to become a hindrance and burden to society. The government  administration and State must rescue their condition of being a means to an end and not ends in themselves. They must readjust their powers so that they are not oppressive; reform their dimensions so that they are not a burden; redefine their functions so that they do not invade the individual's own sphere. Uruguay is making efforts to attain a more beneficial position in the world economy through its participation in new programmes of subregional economic integration. It is thus working with the governments of Argentina  Brazil  Paraguay and Chile in order to arrive at an efficient and significant integration with the aimed at the extension and opening of our markets and the improvement of our competitiveness.The political context of the region could not be  ore appropriate for this type of undertaking. The complete democratisation of the South American subcontinent - an extraordinary process which have not been clearly appreciated from the outside because of similar processes in other regions - was complemented by the establishment of governments with reform agendas and a modern and dynamic vision of international affairs. The Bush initiative for the Americas proposes a positive road for co-operation between the United States and Latin America. Uruguay is prepared to take that path in the certainty that  ore equitable relations can be established in the hemisphere through the dialogue that the initiative proposes.But the efforts of one country would be sterile if the world economic contest were to remain unfavourable. The General Assembly recognised the impact of external factors on the developing efforts of each individual country when it stated that the international community is responsible for supporting the efforts of developing countries towards the solution of their economic and social problems by creating a favourable international environment. Undoubtedly  no economic environment is favourable when the participation of developing countries in world trade is hindered by subsidies  restrictions and protectionism  when a large number of Latin American and African countries face an overwhelming foreign debt  when foreign investment has retreated and when the fluctuating  and usually decreasing  price of commodities is unpredictable. Perhaps the clearest example of the contradictious in today's international panorama is the massive transfer of resources from the countries that most need capital towards the industrialised countries. This fact stifles all possibilities of growth.None the less  some encouraging signs can be seen in this hazy panorama. Creditor countries  for instance  have accepted shared responsibility and have recognised that the debt is not merely a financial problem  but also a political one. The issue of foreign debt weighs heavily on many developing countries. Uruguay  in spite of having unfailingly paid its obligations  is no exception.The world requires a change of attitude on the part of the industrialised countries towards the prevailing international economic order. They hold the key to trade  technology and investments  and consequently it is they who are in a position to facilitate a more equitable incorporation of the developing countries into the world economic system. We are not asking for favours. Developing countries are not a group of beggars; nor do we ask for charity. What we do request is the opening of markets to our products  fair prices  technological co-operation and investment on fair terms.Pour years ago the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) launched the Uruguay Bound to face the critical problems that affect international trade. Two years later  the objectives of the Bound were ratified in Montreal during a mid-term evaluation.Last July  however  at the meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee  the highest body of the Bound  over which I had the honour to preside  the results were not encouraging. The present status of the negotiations is marked by slow progress and stagnation in highly sensitive areas. If this situation remains unchanged  we shall go to the final meeting of the Bound  which is to be held in Brussels nest December  with partial and insufficient results. This is deemed unacceptable by the developing countries which stated that the principal industrialised countries did not facilitate negotiations by maintaining their inflexibility on many topics  among which ray delegation wishes to place particular emphasis on access to markets and agriculture.This sector is crucially important for Uruguay. The Cairns Group - of which we are members - has already expressed its conviction that the Round will not succeed unless satisfactory agreements are reached on agricultural matters. This is the position of Uruguay as well. If agricultural negotiations do not succeed  the whole Round will fail. We have no choice. The results of the Round must be consistent with the Declaration of Punta del Seste by which it was launched and through which its objectives were established.This process must be clear and based on a multilateral consensus that allows for a more equitable commercial system. Uruguay will continue to work towards the ultimate achievement of these goals.Peace is built day by day. It is built from deep in the hearts of men to become a reality in the life of nations. How could it be built then without first promoting the human being his essential rights his dignity and values? How can we expect to build peace if human rights and the rights of people are not respected? Therein resides the very origin of every upheaval and of any lack of peace. Respect for and promotion of human rights is therefore the inevitable foundation for peace.As long as somewhere in the world there is no full respect for the dignity of men and women  flesh and blood  body and soul - the main protagonists of the world and its history - as long as apartheid persists as long as racism persists in its true and accurate sense without misleadingly stretching its meaning either historically or politically as long as persecution and discrimination exist as long as political rights are not recognised and enforced and as long as free and periodic elections are not held  it will be impossible to promote the development of man  and economic  social and cultural development will be inconsistent.I should like to pay a tribute to the work done by the Secretary-General  an eminent Latin American citizen with whom I recently had the honour of co-operating as his Special Representative for the question of Western Sahara. His work during this last year - brilliantly set forth in his report to the General Assembly - has made a remarkable contribution to international peace and security. His work has already obtained successful results in some cases. In others  it has cleared the way by pointing out the applicable principles and criteria for the just and peaceful settlement of conflicts. In his inaugural address President Lacalle defined today's world in the following words.""The world we face today is a world in ferment  a world of change and renewal. Its main characteristic  its motive force  lies in the freedom of the individual and the independence of nations  two terns of the eternal equation of history.""This changing world presents challenges of great historic significance to the United Nations.The General Assembly held a successful session last year under the presidency of the Ambassador of Nigeria  Joseph Garba  whom it is now my pleasure to congratulate on the performance of his task. This year we must take decisions on many subjects that are as complex as they are important  at a time of serious challenges that call for immediate solutions. The fact that you  Mr. President  have been elected to guide our debates lets us anticipate another successful session. We know your intellectual capacity  your awareness of the international situation  which  together with your sense of justice and your skills in conciliation  will I am sure  enable you to guide our work to a successful conclusion.In the name of my Government  I congratulate you and wish you every success. "
"147",7241,"USA",45,1990,"﻿It is really a great privilege to greet you today as we begin what marks a new and historic session of the General Assembly. My congratulations to the Honourable Guido de Marco on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. On a personal note I want to say that  having witnessed the unprecedented unity and co-operation of the past two months  I have never been prouder to have once served within your ranks and never been prouder that the United States is the host country for the United Nations.Forty-five years ago  while the fires of an epic war still raged across two oceans and two continents  a small group of men and women began a search for hope amid the ruins and they gathered in San Francisco  stepping back from the haze and horror to try to shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream.Intensely idealistic  and yet tempered by war  they sought to build a new kind of bridge  a bridge between nations  a bridge that might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest day.The founding of the United Nations embodied our deepest hopes for a peaceful world. And during the past year we have come closer than ever before to realizing those hopes. We have seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom. The revolution of 1989 swept the world almost with a life of its own  carried by a new breeze of freedom that transformed the political climate from Central Europe to Central America  and touched almost every corner of the globe. That breeze has been sustained by a now almost-universal recognition of a simple  fundamental truth: the human spirit cannot be locked up forever. The truth is that people everywhere are motivated in much the same way and people everywhere want much the same thing: the chance to live a life of purpose  the chance to choose s life in which they and their children can learn and grow healthy  worship freely  and prosper through the work of their hands and their hearts and their minds. We are not talking about the power of nations  but the power of individuals: the power to choose  the power to risk  the power to succeed.This is a new and different world. Not since 1945 have we seen the real possibility of using the United Nations as it was designed - as a centre for international collective security.The changes in the Soviet Union have been critical to the emergence of a stronger United Nations. The United States-Soviet relationship is finally beyond containment and confrontation  and now we seek to fulfil the promise of mutually shared understanding.The long twilight struggle that for 45 years has divided Europe  our two nations and much of the world has come to an end. Much has changed over the last two years. The Soviet Union has taken many dramatic and important steps to participate fully in the community of nations  and when the Soviet Union agreed with so many of us here in the United Nations to condemn the aggression of Iraq  there could be no doubt that we had indeed put four decades of history behind us. We are hopeful that the machinery of the United Nations will no longer he frozen by the divisions that plagued us during the cold war; that at long last we can build new bridges and tear down old walls; that at long last we will be able to build a new world based on an event for which we have all hoped - an end to the cold war.Two days from now the world will be watching when the cold war is formally buried in Berlin. And in this time of testing a fundamental question must be asked a question not for any one nation  but for the United Nations. And the question is this: Can we work together in a new partnership of nations? Can the collective strength of the world community  expressed by the United Nations  unite to deter and defeat aggression? Because the cold war's battle of ideas is not the last epic battle of this century. Two months ago  in the waning weeks of one of history's most hopeful summers  the vast  still beauty of the peaceful Kuwaiti desert was fouled by the stench of diesel and the roar of steel tanks. Once again the sound of distant thunder echoed across a cloudless sky. And once again the world awoke to face the guns of August.But this time the world was ready. The United Nations Security Council's resolute response to Iraq's unprovoked aggression has been without precedent. Since the invasion on 2 August the Council has adopted eight major resolutions setting the terms for a solution to the crisis.The Iraqi regime has yet to face the facts. But as I said last month: The annexation of Kuwait will not be permitted to stand. This is not simply the view of the United States. It is the view of every Kuwaiti  the Arab League and the United Nations. Iraq's leaders should listen: it is Iraq against the world. Let me take this opportunity to make the policy of my Government clear. The United States supports the use of sanctions to compel Iraq's leaders to withdraw immediately and without condition from Kuwait. We also support the provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purposes  so long as distribution can be properly monitored. Our quarrel is not with the people of Iraq. We do not wish for them to suffer. The world's quarrel is with the dictator who ordered that invasion.Along with others  we have dispatched military forces to the region to enforce sanctions  to deter and if need be defend against further aggression. We seek no advantage for ourselves. Nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in Saudi Arabia for one day longer than is necessary. The United States forces were sent at the request of the Saudi Government. The American people - and this President - want every single American soldier brought home as soon as this mission is completed. Let me also emphasise that all of us here at the United Nations hope that military force will never be used. We seek a peaceful outcome - a diplomatic outcome. And one more thing - in the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait  I truly believe there may be opportunities: for Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently; for the States of the Gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability; and for all the States and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel. But the world's key task - now  first and always - must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerated or rewarded.Through the United Nations Security Council  Iraq has been judged - fairly judged - by a jury of its peers  the very nations of the Earth. Today the regime stands isolated and out of step with the times  separated from the civilized world not by space but by centuries. Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throw-back to another era  a dark relic from a dark time. It has plundered Kuwait; it has terrorised innocent civilians; it has held even diplomats hostage. Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction. But this outrageous disregard for basic human rights does not come as a total surprise. Thousands of Iraqis have been executed on political and religious grounds  and even more through a genocidal  poison-gas war waged against Iraq's own Kurdish villagers.As a world community  we must act - not only to deter the use of inhumane weapons like mustard and nerve gas  but to eliminate the weapons entirely. That is why one year ago I came to the General Assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from the face of the Earth. I promised that the United States would destroy over 88 per cent of its stockpile in the first eight years of a chemical weapons ban treaty  and 100 per cent - all of them - in 10 years  if all nations with chemical weapons capabilities signed the treaty. We have stood by those promises. In June the United States and the Soviet Union signed a landmark agreement to halt production and destroy the vast majority of our stockpiles. Today United States chemical weapons are being destroyed.But time is running out. This is not merely a bilateral concern. The Gulf crisis proves how important it is to act together - and to act now - to conclude an absolute  world-wide ban on these weapons. We must also redouble our efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons  biological weapons and the ballistic missiles that can rain destruction upon distant peoples.The United Nations can help bring about a new day  a day when these kinds of terrible weapons and the terrible despots who would use them are both a thing o£ the past. It is in our hands to leave these dark machines behind  in the dark ages where they belong  and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a new world order and a long era of peace.We have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends the cold war - a partnership based on consultation  co-operation and collective action  especially through international and regional organizations; a partnership united by principle and the rule of law  and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and commitment; a partnership whose goals are to increase democracy  increase prosperity  increase the peace  and reduce arms.And as we look to the future the calendar offers up a convenient milestone  a signpost by which to measure our progress as a community of nations. The year 2000 marks a turning-point  beginning not only the turn of the decade  not only the turn of the century  but also the turn of the millennium. And 10 years from now  as the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly begins  you will again find many of us in this Hall  our hair a bit more grey  perhaps  and a little less spring in our walk. But you will not find us with any less hope or idealism  or any less confidence in the ultimate triumph of mankind. I see a world of open borders  open trade  and - most importantly - open minds; a world that celebrates the common heritage that belongs to all the world9s people  taking pride not just in hometown or homeland  but in humanity itself. I see a world touched by a spirit like that of the Olympics: based not on competition that is driven by fear  but sought out of joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence. I see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and convert old foes  and where the Americas  North  Central and South  can provide a model for the future of all humankind - the world's first completely democratic hemisphere.And I see a world building on the emerging new model of European unity; not just Europe  but the whole world - whole and free. This is precisely why the present aggression in the Gulf is a menace not only to one region's security but to the entire world's vision of our future. It threatens to turn the dream of a new international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy  in which the law of the jungle supplants the law of nations.That is why the United Nations reacted with such historic unity and resolve. And that is why this challenge is a test that we cannot afford to fail. I am confident that we will prevail. Success  too  will have lasting consequences - reinforcing civilized standards of international conduct  setting a new precedent in international co-operation  brightening the prospects for our vision of the future.There are 10 more years until the century is out - 10 more years to put the struggles of the twentieth century permanently behind us; 10 more years to help to launch a new partnership of nations. Throughout those 10 years - and beginning now - the United Nations has a new and vital role in building towards that partnership. Last year's session of the General Assembly showed how we can make greater progress towards a more pragmatic and successful United Nations. And  for the first time  the Security Council is beginning to work as it was designed to work.Now is the time to set aside old and counter-productive debates  procedures  controversies and resolutions. It is time to replace polemic attacks with pragmatic action. We have shown that the United Nations can count on the collective strength of the international community. We have shown that the United Nations can rise to the challenge of aggression  just as its founders hoped it would. How  in this time of testing  we must also show that the United Nations is the place to build international support and consensus for meeting the other challenges that we face.The world remains a dangerous place. Our security and well-being often depend  in part  on events occurring far away. We need serious international co-operative efforts to make headway on threats to the environment  on terrorism  on management of the debt burden  on the fight against the scourge of international drug trafficking  and on refugees and peace-keeping efforts around the world.But the world also remains a hopeful place. Calls for democracy and human rights are being reborn everywhere. These calls are an expression of support for the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter. They encourage our hopes for a more stable  more peaceful  more prosperous world.Free elections are the foundation of democratic government  and can produce dramatic successes  as we have seen in Namibia and Nicaragua. The time has come to structure the role of the United Nations in such efforts more formally. So  today  I propose that the United Nations establish a special co-ordinator for electoral assistance  to be assisted by a United Nations electoral commission comprising distinguished experts from around the world.As with free elections  we believe that universal United Nations membership - membership for all States - is central to the future of the Organization and to the new partnership that we have discussed. In support of this principle  and in conjunction with United Nations efforts to reduce regional tensions  the United States fully supports United Nations membership for the Republic of Korea. We do so without prejudice to the ultimate objective of reunification of the Korean Peninsula  and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Building on these and other initiatives  we must join together in a new compact - all of us - to bring the United Nations into the twenty-first century. I call today for a major  long-term effort to do this. We should build on the success  the admirable success  of our distinguished Secretary-General - my long-time friend and colleague  and yours - Javier Perez de Cuellar. We should strive to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations.The United States is committed to playing its part - helping to maintain global security  promoting democracy and prosperity. My Administration is fully committed to supporting the United Nations  and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the Charter. International peace and security - and international freedom and prosperity - require no less. The world must know and understand that from this hour  from this day  from this Hall  we step forth with a new sense of purpose  a new sense of possibilities. We are united  prepared to swim upstream  to march uphill  to tackle the tough challenges as they come - not only as the United Nations  but as the nations of the world united.Let it be said of the final decade of the twentieth century that this was a time when humankind came into its own  when we emerged from the grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a revolution of the spirit and of the mind  and began a journey into a new day  a new age  and a new partnership of nations.The United Nations is now fulfilling its promise as the world's parliament of peace. I congratulate you  I support you  and I wish you Godspeed in the challenges ahead. "
"148",7311,"VCT",45,1990,"﻿I wish  on behalf of my country  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. I am pleased to express our confidence in your ability to undertake the very important duties with which you have been entrusted.I also extend our deep appreciation to His Excellency Major General Joseph H. Garba  President of the General Assembly at the forty-fourth session  for the exemplary manner in which he carried out his difficult task.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the admission of the Principality ff Liechtenstein as the 161st member of the United Nations  The entire international community takes great pride that this event which has brought us one step nearer to the achievement of the goal of universal member ship My government unequivocally supports the call for Iraq's withdrawal from the territory of Kuwait. No small vulnerable country in the United Nations system can be expected to adopt any other stand  and we are fortunate that the United Nations exists to provide a forum for international opinion against plunder to be asserted.  I support the proposal  put forward by President Mitterrand of the Republic of France  that an international conference be called to attempt to settle the outstanding issues of the Middle East. I wish to state that I consider the eloquent presentation by President Mitterrand to be the most lucid advice ever put forward for resolution of the Middle East crisis. We remain convinced that no settlement of the Gulf crisis  which continues to threaten the welfare of all our peoples  can be accomplished without resolving the outstanding issue of a homeland for the Palestinians. We who have represented the landless poor in our own countries know the fervour with which our own people pursue the objective of owning their own land and homes.The General Assembly  however  should not continue to engage in the credentials controversy on Israel's fight to a place in this Assembly. Vow that the legitimate voice of the Palestinians has recognised Israel's right to exist there should be no challenge to Israel's position in the United Rations or any of its agencies.But if the United Nations is to maintain its high moral ground on the annexation of Kuwait and endorse all the Security Council resolutions on Iraqi aggression  then Security Council resolution 243 (1967)  which concerns the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza  should also be observed. The occupation ofLebanon is similarly reprehensible. We have to be logical and consistent. It is for these reasons that we support the call for an internationally negotiated settlement in the Middle East. To attempt to get around the holding of an international peace conference means that the United Nations system is being used merely as a convenience  to deal with only part of the problem.A peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis is in the best interests of the international community. War will mean further hardship for the dispossessed in the Middle East itself; provide further cause for the religious terrorists; create untold chaos with respect to inflation in other lands; and in general aggravate social tensions everywhere.The stalemate in the Gulf cannot be allowed to drift interminably. The sanctions must be meticulously observed  and any variation should be the responsibility of the Sanctions Committee. Let me go further and say that no group of countries should think that any conflict in their area that undermines the international economy will be left entirely to them to settle without the intervention of the international community.In summary  our humble opinion is that  first  Iraq must withdrawunconditionally from Kuwait in accordance with Security Council resolution 660 (1990); secondly  sanctions against Iraq must continue  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 661 (1990) and 670 (1990); and  thirdly  an international peace conference on the Middle East should be celled  with the objective of ensuring implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). When I last spoke in this Assembly about the Disarmament Conference I very early put forward the idea that the savings resulting from disarmament should be applied to the environment. I went further and suggested that halting desertification in Africa should be the first such project. This concept has gained currency and I still hope that it will be considered as a principle to be generally endorsed. There is need  however  to ensure greater international co-ordination of the various initiatives being undertaken to address environmental issues. We do not  however  need new agencies. The importance of the environment has led my Government to declare the 19908 as the decade of the environment  and we have been giving this matter the priority it deserves.In respect of using the peace dividend for environmental purposes  let me add that those who are among the poorer nations in this world have no moral authority to demand any benefits from the lessening of the East-West conflict when an inordinate percentage of their own budgets is dedicated to military expenditure.The economic and political developments in Eastern Europe reserve the commendation of this Assembly. While the momentum of change is now firmly in the heads of the people of those countries  and similar changes are being pursued in Latin America  South East Asia and the Koreas  none of this would have happened without the brilliant leadership of President Gorbachev. I wish to pay tribute to his vision. Our Caribbean has benefited from his leadership  and we therefore wish to place our appreciation on record. It is a tragedy that what has been gained by the re-establishment of the pre-eminence of the free market economy and the lessening of East-West tensions should be so critically undermined by the illogical behaviour of Iraq. But again let me assert that the recognition by us of illogical behaviour and the refusal to recognise the weight of international response  indicates that there is essentially a basic conflict between different Modes of thinking. It looks as though our Cartesian heritage in Western civilisation does not equip us to deal with the extravagances of religious fundamentalism in the Middle East  a deep and perilous canyon divides our cultures. We should therefore adopt a posture of standing firm  while at the same time using every possible means of communication  by utilising expertise which can bridge these different methodologies of thinking and so permanently resolve these issues.My delegation reiterates the solidarity of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines with the people of the Republic of Haiti. It is our wish that before long the opportunity will be given to the Haitian people to exercise their sovereign right to choose and to participate freely in the determination of their own destiny without any external interference. We note  however  that while the people of Haiti must ultimately determine their own destiny and that of their country  the support of the international community is a necessary condition for the country's early progress towards democracy and development. We therefore urge the international community and relevant international organisations to increase their technical  economic and financial co-operation with Haiti in order to support its economic and social development efforts. Changes taking place in several Eastern European nations and Measures aimed at encouraging such changes must contribute to world peace. There is a movement away from outmoded political and economic systems and greater emphasis is being placed on individual liberty  initiative and enterprise.I wish to congratulate the people of Germany on the historic unification of their country. Important lessons for many of us can be drawn from the German experience  beginning with Germany's well-structured constitution and the discipline of its peoples in the workplace. The interaction of these factors has yielded the surpluses with which to bargain for freedom and has helped to offset the burden of decades of communist misdirection.We in the Caribbean recognise the need for our political unification and I pray that the day will come when we can request this Assembly to recognise the new statue that should attend our current initiatives.On the Kampuchean problem  we support all initiatives aimed at achieving a political solution that would ensure respect for the territorial integrity o£ Kampuchea and the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination. We fully support the recent United Nations peace plan agreed to by the four Cambodian factions for a comprehensive peace settlement. I have seen the desperate conditions of their refugees on the border and congratulate the United Nations on the relief efforts made on their behalf.Coming nearer home  the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines takes note of the recent developments in Central America and expresses the hope that the peaceful conditions which at present exist will become a permanent feature of the entire subregion. It is our hope that these favourable conditions will facilitate the early return of refugees and displaced persons to their countries of origin so that they may participate in the orderly reconstruction of the subregion. I wish to conclude by congratulating the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  on the excellent job he is doing to ensure that the objectives of the United Nations are honoured."
"149",7358,"VEN",45,1990,"﻿On behalf of my Government  allow me to congratulate you very sincerely. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  Your personal qualities and experience are a sure guarantee of an efficient and productive co-ordination of the work of this session. Your election is also a well-deserved tribute to your country  Malta  a land of age-old culture  continually present in the history of the Western world. I wish to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba  who guided the activities of the Assembly's preceding session with skill  wisdom and balance.We take special pleasure in welcoming two new Member States: the Republic of Namibia and the Principality of Liechtenstein. Venezuela has been an unswerving supporter of the Namibian people's struggle for independence. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Venezuela cook an active part in the Council's determined defence of the Namibian cause. We hail the advent of Namibia to independent life and its accession to membership in the international community as a sovereign nation after seven decades of domination by the infamous apartheid regime of South Africa  the shame of mankind. Having gained its political independence  Namibia seeds to achieve the economic and social developments necessary to consolidate independent statehood and a democratic society. The support of the international community is essential if it is to meet those goals. Venezuela has already approached the Namibian authorities with a view to identifying possibilities for co-operation in the fields of energy  mining and fisheries. At the Multilateral level  Venezuela has also pledged to contribute to co-operation projects for Namibia.With respect to the interminable and ominous conflict of apartheid. Venezuela calls upon all nations not to suspend or case sanctions against South Africa until the conclusion of agreements that put into effect President De Klerk's efforts and meet leader Nelson Mandela's proposals.I must express ay great pleasure at the reunification of Germany  which will be formalised on 3 October - an event we Venezuelans view as the culmination of a difficult stage of history and as the beginning of a new stage which will provide a lasting example of the peaceful building of a new international order. We share the joy of the German people and express our hope that this event will show the entire world the fruits of reconciliation end understanding.I represent a country of profound democratic commitment and a long tradition of peace. Our international activities have always focused on removing every obstacle to harmony and co-operation between nations. For that reason we welcome and support initiatives submitted to the General Assembly to strengthen the fundamental responsibility of the United Nations to guarantee the two inseparable objectives of world peace and international justice  particularly now that events we could never have predicted only a few months ago have led for the first time since the Second World War to steady progress towards genuine global understanding. These sudden changes in the structure of international relations call for a careful study of international ethics  which are so often infringed upon by great Powers and by regional conflicts. There is dramatic proof today that the considerable reduction in the nuclear threat and East-West detente do not necessarily mean the disappearance of serious international conflicts. The present crisis in the Persian Gulf is a painful ease in point.During the last turbulent 45 years of world history  nuclear peace has been achieved by means of an ambiguous balance  cynically called the balance of terror  which has continually pushed aside other available control mechanisms. Venezuela rejects that monstrous approach to restraining bipolar confrontation  confident that the reply to the threat of international anarchy or regional conflict does not lie in mutual threats or military escalation. We have always believed it possible to construct an equilibrium for peace  based on justice  equal rights for all peoples to enjoy their resources; we have always believed that all peoples have a right to well-being^ allowing for e genuine system of collective security  the raison d'etre of the United Nations. That is why we have always advocated ā new international economic order which we must keep free of any tinge of confrontation. We believe that now that the cold war is over  there are new prospects for more intensive programmes of disarmament and greater co-operation for development. We believe that today more than ever before the United Nations has a chance to attain the universal dream of an equilibrium for peace based on understanding and co-operation. Dialogue for concerted international action in the economic sphere must be initiated.Last August  at its Caracas meeting  the South Commission  under the chairmanship of the former President of Tanzania  Julius Nyerere  issued its final report  a valuable and exhaustive document written in the language of dialogue characteristic of these new times. It deserves to become a basic instrument that can inspire constructive dialogue between North and South.Venezuela would also like the end of bipolar confrontation to bring about the disappearance of a system whereby some Powers believe they have the obligation or the right to assume the individual role of taking control and ensuring the security of the world. Now that the East-West confrontation is over  the United Nations should perform that function in the name of international law and the principles of the Charter signed by all the countries represented here. In his historic address to the Assembly  the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze  spoke along those lines.A mechanism must be devised to ensure the implementation of decisions and sanctions adopted by the United Nations in response to aggression against any of its Members; to facilitate the demilitarization of conflicts through law-enforcement and support activities in regions where the adversaries in a conflict feel threatened  as was recently the case in Namibia and Nicaragua; or to support efforts at peace-making and democratization. All this would encourage States that feel attacked or threatened to look to the United Nations for a response within the Organization rather than bolstering their security at the expense of their peoples  through a costly arms race. It will be possible to achieve the non-proliferation of new and increasingly destructive weapons only if there is an alternative mechanism of effective deterrence.If the United Nations cannot provide that assurance  resources will continue to be diverted from education  health  nutrition  growth and development to offensive and defensive arsenals in an illusory race for autonomous security and defence. Venezuela agrees with those who say that the end of confrontation between the super-Powers opens the way to great opportunities for peace  but also to great risks. The ability of the great Powers to influence or settle any future problems or conflicts is  paradoxically  negligible. For the most part  existing problems are of a global nature  affecting all nations  which are linked in general interdependence in all areas - from the economy  trade and welfare to the environment and natural resources. Although it is urgently necessary to secure the benefits brought by the end of the cold war and to take additional measures to reduce to a minimum the risk of conflicts between nations there is an equally pressing need to find safe and reliable ways to implement the other tenets supporting the multilateral system  such as the right to both economic and social development. A year ago at this same forum for international dialogue  I proposed that we dedicate this last decade of the century to the children  with the aim of substantially reducing infant mortality  making primary schooling available world-wide and eradicating severe malnutrition. I also invited us all to sign the Convention on the Rights of the Child as part of the new international ethics. The signing of the Convention by a majority of the States Members of the United Nations the Children's Summit held last weekend and the disappearance of East-West tensions all combine to create a climate conducive to a global commitment to go beyond statements of good intentions and deal with the task of combating child mortality  protecting nursing infants and pregnant women  effectively improving their health and securing for children a proper education and qualification for work.I realise that such a massive programme requires substantial resources  so I propose that Member States agree on a 10 per cent reduction in our military budgets and allocate that 10 per cent to a United Nations fund for social development  to be used in a frontal assault on the poverty that crushes and exterminates hundreds of millions of children throughout the world.As is shown by the recent experience of Latin America  if the progress ofdemocracy in our countries is to become irreversible we need a final solution to the problems of critical and extreme poverty. The inevitable programmes of macro-economic adjustment  essential if we are to modernize our societies  cannot advance without parallel action against hunger  unemployment and lack of opportunity  which begin with malnutrition and lack of health care in childhood and continue with lack of study opportunities and employment opportunities for the young.Latin America is now fully committed to democracy as a political system. But democracy cannot be sustained on a social foundation of persistent poverty. The repeated demands for more favourable trade conditions and better economic and financial international relations are not mere rhetoric. The establishment of a new world order is essential for resolving the basic conflict of inequality between human beings. An attitude springing from basic ethics must govern relations between the most powerful countries and the poorest. On 16 November 1976  at this same rostrum of mankind  I said;""The building of a new international economic order is an imperative for peace ... Otherwise "" I said then and repeat now ""the political balance of the world will be in serious jeopardy."" (A/31.PV 67 para. 16)This is a time of historical transition. Now that we are 10 years away from the twenty-first century ideological schemes conceived in the nineteenth century no longer apply in our present reality. As a Latin American  I must express my concern over the way in which economic variables receive more emphasis than political and social ones. The modernization of our societies cannot ignore the importance of internal balance. If social conflicts arise in developing nations  if the gap between their inhabitants deepens  conditions will inevitably become ripe for international imbalances. Our peoples want to live in a democracy  but there is no democracy without social justice. International co-operation cannot be contingent solely upon the formal reorganization of government finances in countries suffering critically from fiscal imbalances. We must find an answer to the fiscal crisis  but we must also find an answer to the social crisis. In truth  fiscal and social crises are but two sides of the same coin. International co-operation must directly address the structural issues of the crisis  eliminating protectionist tendencies in developed countries  the ever more intolerable effects of foreign debt and the absurd attitude that the necessities of macro-economic adjustments are merely a technical problem  with no social impact or political consequences.Latin America received with interest and satisfaction the Americas Initiative proposed by the President of the United States  Mr. George Bush. The proposal of a free-trade zone with the north of the American continent raises the hope that the veil of silence and the misunderstandings that have marked relations between the two Americas will now begin to vanish. We sincerely hope that the Americas Initiative will initiate a definitive break with isolation. As the world rapidly moves towards big economic blocs  the United States and Latin America cannot continue to turn their backs on each other  as they have for decades. We shall now need each other.In the long run the Americas Initiative could create conditions for the benefits of competition  now gravely lacking in our economic and trade relations  to be felt. The structural changes to be brought about by free trade and access to a bigger market would spur our economic growth. The elimination of discrimination against countries in the southern part of the American hemisphere would create conditions favourable to joint negotiations. Yet  at the same time  the Americas Initiative poses a formidable challenge to Latin American countries. We shall no longer be able to hide behind the rhetoric of integration. If we want to participate in the successful development of this project  we must carry out the tasks essential for intensifying co-operation between ourselves and strengthening intra-regional trade. We must develop strategic alliances between Governments  public and private institutions and research centres of the countries involved  and promote the establishment of networks of linked production and service enterprises  encouraging the setting of uniform technical standards. It is only by raising the level of intra-Latin American interdependence that We can become competitive at the international level. We Latin American countries must seriously explore the liberalisation of our reciprocal trade. We must strengthen our co-operation in transport and bolster the institutions promoting its integration. Only then will we avoid the delusion of believing that we might accede individually to the benefits o£ the Americas Initiative.It is indeed paradoxical that  in the present post-cold-war climate of progress in integration and the appearance of a new spirit favouring international co-operation  we see winds of war blowing over our planet. The crisis in the Persian Gulf concerns us all and particularly countries that  like Venezuela  are producers of oil and members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). From the moment Iraq invaded Kuwait  Venezuela strove to create a framework for negotiation. We do not believe in a military solution to the conflict. We insist on a political way out of the crisis. Arab nations have a decisive role to play  and as part of the Western Hemisphere and as partners in OPEC we should encourage that. We have tried to use the multiple levels on which we act to generate agreements that would reduce the effects of the conflict on the world's oil markets.In this respect  I should like to emphasise the responsible and stabilising course taken by OPEC  an organisation in its thirtieth year of existence. The great nations of the industrialised North - the main oil importers - must acknowledge that if OPEC had not decided temporarily to cover the market deficit  the escalation in oil prices and the consequent destabilisation of the world's economy would have been much worse.Neither OPEC nor the industrialised world can allow abrupt price increases  nor can we tolerate - once the Gulf crisis is resolved - equally abrupt drops in the price of crude. Such excessive fluctuations are harmful to us all  consumers and producers alike  and only favour speculators who do not care much about the well-being of nations or the world economy.We share in this responsibility as producers of a large portion of today's market and  above all  as possessors of the greatest crude reserves. Exploitation of these resources is what will guarantee the world's future needs in energy. However  it will require prices that secure regular revenues for the producers and sufficient resources to finance the investments necessary to ensure present levels of production and replenishment of reserves. For many decrees to come oil will continue to be a fundamental ingredient of development  and neither producers nor consumers can permit a state of disarray in the oil market.I hereby propose an oil conference of producers and consumers  under the auspices of the United Nations  to be convened urgently in order to address  once and for all  the political reality of oil. The first step of such an encounter should be a meeting of the OPEC countries and the International Energy Agency.I should like on this occasion to reiterate our concern regarding the impact of excessively high oil prices on the development plans of third world countries that are totally dependent on oil imports. For the last 10 years Mexico and Venezuela have tried to reduce this impact on the economies of Central America and the Caribbean through the San Jose Agreement. However  this kind of solidarity cannot be undertaken unilaterally and must be part of global solutions whereby industrialised nations seriously assume their responsibilities regarding international co-operation. The industrialised countries must share the responsibly for economic growth and political stability in that vulnerable region of the hemisphere so as to prevent new explosions of violence or unlimited continuation of existing ones. We oil-producing countries are aware of the need to help the oil-importing countries of the third world with compensation measures such as the OPEC Fund or the San José Agreement. We shall continue to do so. But we think that the commitments of the countries that can afford more should be extended.Just as OPEC assumed its share of responsibility in raising production to offset the temporary scarcity of crude on the international markets  and inasmuch as the great Powers seek to have others share the cost of a military presence in the Persian Gulf  countries with fewer resources need support in overcoming the situation of scarce supply and high oil prices.In this respect  allow me to express my satisfaction at the proposal made by the President of France  Mr. Francois Mitterrand  to begin""discussion of a comprehensive plan for assistance to the developing world  a plan that would be fed by new resources and that would lay the ground for an in-depth consideration of the subject by all the participants in what could well become a tragedy to end all tragedies if we do not make up our minds to change our ways  to step up our pace and to rethink our goals."" Thus  we urge the more powerful nations to co-operate in meeting the energy demand of the poorer countries in a manner that may be stable and permanent  rather than accidental or fortuitous. Venezuela  together with our partners in OPEC and other oil-exporting countries not members of OPEC  such as Mexico  is willing to proceed with co-operation programmes such as the San José Agreement  but we also look forward to hearing proposals from large industrialised nations in support of the stabilisation we advocate. What this Assembly may decide will set the guiding principles for the role the international community wants the United Nations to play at this critical time of transition. We now begin to realise  at long last  that many of its past limitations were due to the bipolar conflict. Now that the conflict is over and the ensuing reforms are on course  we aspire to return to the original postulates of the Organization  by revising the Charter if necessary  to make the Organisation fully and democratically capable of intervening preventively in the many problems of the world and of addressing those already looming at a distance  of which I would make particular mention of those related to peace and economic and social development  where so much joint effort is still needed.All the nations of the world  and particularly the militarily and economically powerful ones  must understand that it is only through a body of international ethics  based on genuine respect for international law as embodied in the Charter and in Treaties and Conventions signed by all States under the sponsorship of the United Nations  that justice  peace and world stability can be upheld. There have been frequent violations of these principles  treaties and conventions in the past. Yet it is precisely row  at this new stage that holds out such promise for mankind  that the world has unanimously rejected the violation of Kuwait's sovereignty by Iraq This must become the beginning of a new  genuine international ethic in which any kind of unilateral intervention is outlawed and international order is re-established by the submission to the United Nations and other international bodies of any existing or looming conflicts. The occupied Palestinian territories and Cambodia  to give just two examples of conflicts of major significance to the world  must be acted upon by the United Nations  after the sovereignty of Kuwait has been restored.I cannot conclude without referring to the co-operation we expect from the United Nations  including the General Assembly  in regard to conflicts of concern to the countries of Latin America. I refer here to peace in El Salvador and to the electoral process in Haiti.	The efforts exerted by the Secretary-General with the FMLN and the Salvadorian Government are of tremendous importance and worthy of praise. We hope that the Assembly will give its full support to the Secretary-General's initiatives and urge both the FMLN and the Government of El Salvador to eliminate existing obstacles to an agreement that will restore peace and well-being to a people devastated by more than a decade of fratricidal war.The Haitian people want democracy and peace. They need the solidarity of the world in their efforts to emerge from their distressing state of exhaustion after long years of cruel dictatorship. I should like to request the General Assembly at this forty-fifth session to adopt the draft resolution submitted by Latin American and Caribbean countries  in regard to the support requested of the United Nations by the Government of Haiti for the holding of an election next December. I should like to conclude by expressing Venezuela’s support for and full confidence in the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar. His leadership  prudent yet steadfast  has brought about many of the changes we have witnessed in recent years. To him and all the staff working with him  we extend our gratitude. We express the hope that they will continue their outstanding work in the interest of the international community  at this new  promising stage of the Organisation's life."
"150",7397,"VNM",45,1990,"﻿Allow me to congratulate Mr. de Marco on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. I am convinced that by building upon the achievements of his predecessor  he will guide this session to a fruitful outcome.I should like to express my deep appreciation for the major contribution of the Secretary-General to the cause of peace and co-operation among nations.I wish to extend a warm welcome to Namibia and Liechtenstein which have just joined our ranks.The most outstanding feature of the world situation today  as has been widely stressed by delegations  consists of the extremely profound and contradictory changes that have taken place throughout the world at an exceptional pace and in a manner unexpected to everyone. These historically unprecedented developments herald still greater changes in the coming decades. The current changes are giving rise to diverging interpretations. Whatever the interpretation  however  the two million years of human history show mankind's constant progress towards peace  national independence  democracy and social progress. There is a unanimous view in this forum that cold-war confrontation is drawing to an end giving way to a new situation of conflict and co-operation between countries coexisting peacefully. Almost all countries have expressed deep concern about a number of global issues - peace  national independence  human rights  development  the environment  demographic explosion and social matters related to the family and to women and children  as well as the debt burden  unequal economic and trade relations  the drug problem  the rise in crime  and so on. Viet Nam fully shares this common concern and supports legitimate demands in this respect. It will do its utmost to contribute  together with the international community  to the solution of those global issues.I should like now to touch upon the encouraging developments around the Cambodian issues  which for the past 10 years has been one of the most controversial at the United Nations.Since 1987 the countries of South-East Asia and the Cambodian parties have been engaging in talks with a view to reaching a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian issue. The two Jakarta Informal Meetings and the talks  in Paris  Bangkok  Jakarta and Tokyo  between Chairman Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk have provided a broad basis for a comprehensive political settlement. At the Jakarta meetings the countries of the region agreed unanimously on the need to solve the two key issues - namely  the total withdrawal off foreign troops  and the elimination off the genocidal Pol Pot regime. The participants in the two Jakarta Informal Meetings have also called on other countries to commit themselves to respecting Cambodia's independence  neutrality and non-alignment. Chairman Hun Sea and Prince Sihanouk have agreed on the creation of an interim authority based on national reconciliation and the holding off truly free and democratic general elections. In particular  through successive talks is Bangkok  the two sides have reached agreement on the establishment of a Supreme National Council  whose 12 members would be equally divided between the two aides. The countries of the region are also unanimously of the view that eventual agreements on Cambodia will have to be guaranteed by an international conference  and their implementation subjected to international control.On the basis of those agreements  the Paris International Conference on Cambodia was convened in Paris in mid-1989. The Conference  under the co-chairmanship of France and Indonesia  having taken an important step forward in the search for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian issue  had to be suspended temporarily. However  it will reconvene once the countries concerned and the Cambodian parties have settled their outstanding differences.The unilateral total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia in September 1989 settled one of the two key questions with regard to solution of the Cambodian issue  This has opened up the way to a comprehensive political settlement.With the unilateral total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops  the Khmer Rouge and its allies nurtured the illusion that they could take advantage of the major shift in the military balance of forces in Cambodia in order to step up their military operations and thereby reverse the situation in that country. There is widespread public concern over the Khmer Rouge's extensive preparations  especially its accumulation of weapons caches that should enable it to wage war for another 7 to 10 years  with the ultimate objective of restoring its genocidal rule.Since the beginning of 1990 the five permanent members of the Security Council have been actively building upon the very significant results achieved at the two meetings of the regional countries  at the talks between the Cambodian sides  and at the Paris International Conference on Cambodia  as well as upon the major efforts made by Australia. The five permanent members have thus succeeded in working out the framework for a comprehensive political solution of the Cambodian issue. Viet Nam greatly appreciates their important contribution.However  the document of the five permanent members of the Security Council fails to mention the question of the elimination of the genocidal regime in Cambodia. The international community cannot tolerate crimes against humanity; it must uphold the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Moreover  Viet Ham holds that the Charter of the United Nations should be scrupulously respected with regard to matters pertaining to the sovereignty of Cambodia  which is an independent country and a Member of the United Nations.At the Informal Meeting in Jakarta last September  under the co-chairmanship of Indonesia and France  the Cambodian parties accepted the recommendations of the five permanent members of the Security Council as the framework for a political settlement of the Cambodia issue  and they set up the Supreme national Council.Viet Ham hopes that a delegation from the Supreme national Council will soon legitimately represent Cambodia at the United Nations. The process of setting up the Supreme national Council is a reminder that no action by any external authority or group of countries can take the place of the determined efforts of the Cambodian parties themselves to solve Cambodia's internal problems.In the course of the past 45 years  the 1954 Geneva International Conference on Indo-China  the 1961-1962 Conference on Laos and the 1973 Paris International Conference on Viet Ham have resulted in the ending of three wars  in the restoration of peace and in recognition of the national rights of the peoples of the Indochinese peninsula. In mid-1989  the Paris International Conference was convened for the purpose of finding a solution to the Cambodian issue. For reasons that are known to everyone  all crises on the Indochina peninsula over the past 45 years have been settled outside the framework of the United Nations  but with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council.This time we are heartened by the very important contribution of the five permanent members and of the Secretary-General  nevertheless  in Viet Ham's view it is most auspicious that the settlement of the Cambodian issue  which was started in Paris  should be concluded in Paris. Viet Ham also holds that the participants in the Paris Conference should finalise the international agreement on Cambodia before the end of October  and that the Conference could be reconvened in November or December to adopt and sign it. One prominent question of great concern to Viet Han as well as to the entire world community is the Gulf crisis. Viet Han holds that this crisis should be solved through peaceful means  within the sphere of the Arab countries and on the basis of respect for the United Nations Charter. For its part  Viet Nan  is complying with Security Council resolution 661 (1990).After suffering from wars of aggression for the past 4S years  the Vietnamese people  as well as the other peoples of the Indo-Chinese peninsula  earnestly aspire to peace and good relations with all other countries in the world on the basis of mutual respect. It is Viet Nam's hope that a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian issue will open the way towards a new era for the peoples of the Indo-Chinese peninsula  an era of peaceful reconstruction and development  and will help promote co-operation in peaceful coexistence among South-East Asian countries.Since 1987 Viet Nam has begun a renewal process with a view to transforming its economy from a system of bureaucratic and centralised management based on State subsidies into an economy of commodity production with a socialist orientation. The year 1989 witnessed major changes in the economic  social and political life of Viet Han. For IS years our economy had been beset by increasingly serious Imbalances between supply and demand  budget revenue and expenditure  monetary quantity and commodities  imports and exports  and so on. The process of reform and restructuring has allowed the gradual restoration of balance within the economy. By the end of 1989 the annual inflation rate had been lowered from about 1 000 per cent down to below 40 per cent; once a country that ranked third in the world among rice importers  Viet Ham had become a rice exporter; and the gap between exports and imports had been very considerably narrowed  with exports boosted from one quarter to three quarters of imports. On the other hand  the investment law of Viet Nam introduced in 1988 is one of the most beneficial to foreign investors and has already helped Viet Nam attract more than $1 billion of foreign investment capital. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has positively appraised the bold measures taken by Viet Nam in its process of economic reform and restructuring. She IMF has stated that Viet Nam has fulfilled its commitments to it  and Viet Nam hopes that the IMF will keep its commitment to Viet Nam. Viet Nam is still groping its way at the macro-economic level in converting a highly centralised planned economy into a socialist-oriented market economy. The initial achievements are still modest but the decisive factor is that the renewal process is on the right track and has yielded results beyond our expectations. It is possible to affirm that the policy of all-round renewal has become an irreversible process.These modest achievements should be appraised bearing in mind the impact of the destruction of 40 years of war on the country's economy and the fact that the renewal process in Viet Nam is taking place in the context of the extremely complex and unexpected developments taking place in the world. These initial achievements in our policy of renewal have laid bare our fundamental errors. Our aim is to build a society for the people. Our error lay in the fact that ours was in practice a society of the State and by the State. The initial success of the renewal process stems from the readjustment of our policy so as effectively to build a society of the people  for the people and by the people. It is clear that a society for the people cannot be of the State and by the State. Obviously the building of a society of the people  by the people and for the people calls for renewal not simply in the economic field but in all spheres  including economic  social  cultural and political.In tandem with the reform and restructuring of its economy  Viet Nam is undertaking a gradual and steady process of political renewal. Viet Nam is determined to take the renewal process forward and at the sane tine to integrate its economy into the world economy. Viet Nam is resolved to preserve its independence and at the same time to develop relations of friendship and co-operation with all other countries on the basis of mutual respect. Such is the basis of the renewal of Viet Nam's foreign policy  a policy of peace  independence and friendly co-operation with all other countries. "
"151",7431,"VUT",45,1990,"﻿I have the honour of speaking today on behalf of the States members of the South Pacific Forum in my capacity as current Chairman of the Forum.At the outset I extend to you  Mr. President  our congratulations and best wishes on your election to preside over this body. Malta  like most of the countries of our own region  is a small island State. Thus  we take particular notice of the honour that has been bestowed upon you. We extend these congratulations to your Government and people as well.We also applaud the accomplishments of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly and of the three special sessions of the Assembly conducted under the capable leadership of your predecessor  His ExcellencyMajor-General Joseph H. Garba of Nigeria. To him  we express our appreciation and offer our congratulations.I also take this opportunity to extend our congratulations and best wishes to the Government and people of the Republic of Namibia  which has finally been allowed to take its rightful place within the community of nations. Namibia's triumph is a triumph for Africa  for the United Nations and for all of humanity. We also congratulate the Principality of Liechtenstein on becoming the newest Member of the United Nations. We look forward to the constructive contributions its delegation will make.Today an important chapter of world history closes  and a new chapter begins. The formal establishment of a single German State provides ample evidence that the most lasting ideas and qualities are those that unite rather than those that divide. This should also serve as a reminder that no people can ever be removed from the contest of its history nor permanently barred from the appointed rendezvous with its destiny.Our congratulations and sincere best wishes are attended to the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Germany on this historic day. Similarly  our congratulations and sincere best wishes are extended to the Government and people of the Republic of Yemen on the recent unification of their country. In both instances unification was achieved peacefully and resulted from the will of the people themselves rather than from political edict or Military fiat. Therein lays an important message. It is to be hoped that that message will be borne in mind by those who night mistakenly believe that another path can be followed successfully. Unity  much like love  can only be based on free consent  equality and mutual respect. The beautiful and majestic Pacific Ocean comprises almost one third of the Earth's surface. Our corner of that great ocean lies in the South Pacific  which is itself a dramatic study in great contrasts. Nature has endowed us with great natural beauty and a hospitable environment. However  from time to time  our beautiful skies turn cloudy  our clear blue waters become turbulent and our calm tropical breezes become frightening winds of death and destruction. Cur environment is thus a blessing and at the same time a major concern.Most  but not all  of the countries in our region are small island States which are extremely vulnerable to external economic factors  as well as sudden climatic changes. All of us prefer to live in peace; yet we repeatedly see our lands  our waters and our atmosphere utilised by others to test their horrible weapons of mass destruction. All of us share a deep and abiding commitment to the United Nations and to the principles of international democracy. However  we are often struck by the fact that our concerns - and in some instances our very existence - are often neglected or even forgotten in the context of the larger global picture. In a symbolic sense  some of us on occasion feel as invisible to others as the title of the classic work. The Invisible Man by the noted African-American author  Ralph Ellison.Although we are island countries  we recognise that  when it comes to economic development and the outstanding social issues of contemporary civilisation  no nation is an island into itself. Some may consider our geographic location to be remote. However  we are very much a part of today's world  just as we were very much a part of the history of yesterday's world. Like the peoples of every other region  we have our own history and our own cultures. We also share common dreams and common expectations  just as we share common fears and common frustrations. The South Pacific Forum  our paramount regional organisation  held its twenty-first annual meeting in Port Vila  Vanuatu  on 31 July and 1 August. The region's Heads of Government addressed a number of important political  economic and environmental concerns. These have been set forth in our communiqué  which we have requested the Secretary-General to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly.That document  A 4S 456  in very brief form sets forth some of our major concerns and preoccupations. However  it does not touch upon every single issue that we believe merits the attention of the international community. For example  we highlighted some of our major concerns on environmental issues  including the very real threat posed to the survival of some Pacific island nations by climatic changes and a rise in the sea-level. However  our very deep concern over nuclear testing in the South Pacific is by now well known to every member of the international community and needs no explicit restatement.The testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific continues to cause us to fear for the future of our young and for unborn generations. At a time when the threat of nuclear war between the super-Powers is far less likely now than it ever was  we continue to ask: What sin have we committed? Why must our region be the site for the testing of nuclear devices  particularly now that the cold war has ended? So soon after the highly successful World Summit for Children  we are struck by the irony of having to pose the questions How  may we ask  are we to enhance the development of our children unless we can assure them that the environment we bequeath to them is an environment capable of sustaining life?Another great concern shared by all members of the South Pacific Forum is the planned destruction of existing chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll. Our concerns have been communicated to the Government of the United States  and we are continuing a constructive dialogue with the United States that centres on those concerns. Without a doubt  our central concern is this specific issue and on our broader conviction that our region should not become a permanent toxic waste disposal centre.On another environmental issue of great importance to the Forum  we have welcomed Japan's decision to cease large-scale drift-net fishing in our region one year in advance of the date stipulated in General Assembly resolution 44 225. This was a very positive measure taken by Japan  and we appreciate its demonstrated sensitivity to our concerns.France has also demonstrated sensitivity with respect to one of the great concerns of countries in our region. As the international community prepares to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  we are pleased to note the positive measures being pursued in Hew Caledonia by the French authorities. The Forum has urged all parties involved to maintain their dialogue and to continue promoting a framework for the peaceful evolution of New Caledonia towards an act of self-determination consistent with the principles and practices of the United Nations.The prestige and the structure of the United Nations are now reaching new heights. Accordingly  the objectives of the Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism are clearly within our reach. Therefore  the Forum believes that a visit to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories by the Secretary-General  or a specially designated representative of the Secretary-General  could help facilitate the completion of the decolonisation process. Like others  countries of the South Pacific cheered the release from prison of Mr  Nelson Mandela. We have also called upon those who currently govern South Africa to take further steps that would signal a commitment to the profound and irreversible changes necessary to accelerate the process of dismantling the apparatus of apartheid and eliminate its effects. Until such time  the Forum has joined others in calling for the continuation of the functions already imposed against South Africa and exploring other avenues of bringing a rapid end to the system of apartheid. That concludes my statement as Chairman of the South Pacific Forum. I shall now make a few observations on behalf of ray own country  Vanuatu.The recently concluded World Summit for Children was a major diplomatic event of potentially enormous social significance. The initiators and organisers are to be commended. But the true measure of the Summit's success does not lie in the number of words written about the meetings or in the number or perceived importance of the Heads of State or Government who participated in them. Rather  the true measure of the Summit's success will be determined by how rapidly we are able to mobilize the resources necessary to guarantee hope for the children of the world.Children are often the first victims of war  the first victims of the drug traffic and the most tragic victims of AIDS  malaria and other crippling and fatal diseases. Unfortunately  children are also often the last to realize benefits from new scientific or technological breakthroughs. Let us take this opportunity to change that.One of the things the nations of the world can do for children  and for everyone else  is to renew our commitment to the rule of law. The recent changes that have swept the entire world from Europe to Africa  to South and Central America  to Asia and to the Pacific demonstrate that there is absolutely no substitute for respect for the rule of law.Today the attention of the entire world is focused on the Persian Gulf. A larger  militarily more powerful country has invaded and continues to occupy its smaller neighbour. As a result  mankind faces the possibility of yet another war. There will be no winners in such a conflict. There will be only losers. The biggest losers will once again be the children. For many of them  the future will end before it begins. The world cannot accept the invasion and attempted annexation of Kuwait. They are acts that defy every accepted norm of international law and offend everyone's sense of decency. The Government of Vanuatu knows of no deed  whether real or imagined  that could conceivably justify the fate that has befallen Kuwait.We pray that the conflict will be resolved without any further loss of life. However  we know that for this to occur  there must be a remarkable change of course. We harbour no illusions with respect to the difficulties ahead.The effects of the conflict are already being felt in every corner of the world. Not a single country can escape the consequences of the invasion of Kuwait. Thus  none of us can sit idly by and be spectators. We must attempt to resolve the problem together  or it will consume us all  one by one.Already the economies of many countries  including our own  have been seriously affected. However  we shall continue to support the principles on which the United Nations is based  for without adherence to those principles that will be nothing but international anarchy. Small countries such ш our own would be particularly vulnerable to the appetites of others.There is no doubt that the invasion of Kuwait is a tragic occurrence. It is tragic for Kuwait; it is tragic for Iraq and for every other country in the region. It is also tragic for the innocent civilians from all countries trapped by circumstances in Kuwait and Iraq.One encouraging sign is that there has been almost universal condemnation of the invasion and continued occupation. Had the nations of the world spoken with similar clarity earlier after similar invasions  Kuwait might perhaps have been spared the fate it now faces. Now that the international community has spoken so unequivocally on the invasion of Kuwait  perhaps others will pause to rethink their own actions. The situation in the Persian Gulf is not the only current regional tragedy. It is merely the on· now occupying centre stage. The Palestine issue is today no nearer to being resolved than it was yesterday. Lebanon continues to be a bruised and battered victim of an endless cycle of violence. Liberia has been deeply shaken by a particularly violent civil conflict. East Timor’s people continue to be forgotten or ignored by many  ho now speak forcefully on the Persian Gulf. One can only hope that there will soon be an opportunity for the people of Western Sahara finally to determine their own future.The potential of a United Nations free of confrontation is highly visible in the progress made towards the settlement of the Cambodia issue. We congratulate the Cambodian parties and encourage them to continue their efforts on behalf of the people of their country  who have suffered so long.The recently concluded second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries was a success  even though it was not possible to fulfil all the very high expectations of those who participated. France  which hosted the meeting  continues to play a positive role in this area. Gradually  progress is being achieved on some of the key issues. Now we must attempt to implement fully the new Plan of Action.Since its inception  the South Commission  under the chairmanship of the former President of Tanzania  Julius K. Nyerere  has been diligently analysing the problems faced by developing countries  the strategies adopted for dealing with those problems and the lessons to be drawn from past experiences. The report of the South Commission contains many useful recommendations. Perhaps its greatest value  however  in its clear statement that responsibility for the development of the South lies in the South and in the hands of the peoples of the South. We fully agree. In conclusion  I wish to join in commending the excellent work of Mr  Javier Peres de Cuellar  our Secretary-General. Today we stand on the threshold of a new era in international relations. To the Secretary-General and the other members of the Secretariat we offer our thanks for their tireless efforts in helping to bring us to that threshold. Now it is for us  the Member States  to take the final decisive step which will open the door to new opportunities and close the door on all our old hostilities and antagonisms. "
"152",7464,"WSM",45,1990,"﻿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to see you guiding our deliberation  during the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Malta is a country with which we enjoy warm ties through our association in both the Commonwealth and this Organisation. We are confident that your skills and wisdom will guide us well.I also want to thank our past President  Mr. Garba of Nigeria  for the superlative manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly at the forty-fourth session and the special sessions on apartheid  illicit drugs and international economic co-operation Likewise  I welcome with joy our new Members: Liechtenstein and Namibia. Liechtenstein is a small country with a long history which can  from its rich and varied experiences  contribute much to us here. Namibia  a new nation whose birth we have waited so long  will share its youth  vigour and enthusiasm with us.Today is the very day on which the two Germanys reunite. We warmly congratulate them on this historic step and wish them well in their united future and in the commitment to which they have dedicated themselves with regard to unity and stability in Europe and world peace. It in an honour indeed to address the Assembly at such a moment in history. This past year has seen incredible changes - changes of which there have been so many and which have come so swiftly and often unexpectedly that it has sometimes seemed as if the world were hurtling heedless into a whole new era. But those of us who have had faith in the United Nations and its system through the years and in a Secretary-General who has so quietly and expertly shouldered his mammoth that knew that the United Nations was taking heed and changing and adapting in response to the world climate  and answering when called upon. Those who in the past celled our body unwieldy  and even fossilised  have seen new circumstances bringing new responses and new ways of doing things from Namibia and Central America to Cambodia. The United Nations has proved that  as the Secretary-General states in his report  it""... is more than a forum for debate; it is also a place ... of purposeful negotiations""  (A 45 l. P. 131 We know that beyond that  it is a vehicle for active and successful peace-making and peace-keeping. It is now fulfilling the promise its founders envisaged for it.Of course  the new spirit which has suffused world politics as a result of the end of the cold war has injected an urgent energy not only into the United Nations and its operations  but also into the solution of regional and national problems  and has given heart and hope to people the world over. The changes in the USSE and Eastern Europe have shown that freedom and democracy  though long suppressed  can and will triumph. The power of the people will prevail  and a new style of statesmanship that has the courage to listen to the people and admit the wrongs of the past and attempt to correct them is  it seems  emerging around the globe.While we see it most plainly in the USSR and Eastern Europe  there is evidence of it across the globe and tyrants should tremble at this wind of candour. Those who do not nay well fall before it  as we have seen happen most graphically in several countries of Eastern Europe.Of course  the most glaring and urgent instance of refusal to acknowledge and reverse a dreadful wrong is the current stand of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. While the world has impressed upon him the need to do so through resolution after resolution of the Security Council and taken action under Chapter VII of the Charter - evidence of the seriousness with which this threat to world peace and security is regarded - he refuses to comply and only utters more threats. We fully support all the resolutions of the Security Council and are taking measures to comply with them where required. We call upon President Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait immediately and unconditionally. We strongly condemn the invasion and the pillaging of Kuwait as well as the brutalities committed there: the taking of hostages and the barbaric use of them as human shields and the incursions into and violations of diplomatic missions. All these actions flout the Charter and international law and offend the conscience of the world.The rays of hope touching other areas of the world have not penetrated there or the two other major trouble areas of the Middle East. We seem no closer to solutions of either the Palestinian problem or Lebanon. The frustrations of the Palestinians in the occupied territories still fester and break out into violence  which is answered with violence and repression. All violence must stop and dialogue replace it. We continue to feel that the most effective way to achieve this is at an international conference under United Nations auspices with all concerned parties participating.Lebanon is still faction-ridden and strife-torn. Those who aggravate these frictions  and use the situation to their own advantage by their interference  must refrain from such activities before Lebanon can begin to be reunified and rebuilt.One of the most alarming features in the Middle East is the proliferation of deadly weapons. Including those of mass destruction and those which desolate populations by chemical means. We are faced with the possibility of the whole region becoming a virtual horror chamber  particularly in view of the dangerous repercussions which these various situations may have on each other and which therefore link the different problems in the Middle East. These points to the need for a comprehensive new approach for the whole Middle Eastern region.The situation in Afghanistan had seemed ready for settlement. The voices of reason had seemed to have penetrated there and it was hoped that on the withdrawal of the Soviet troops - action to be commended - a comprehensive peace could be worked out under United Nations auspices. However  continued fighting and factionalism has delayed the process. There is a stalemate at present and we hope that the various parties will soon come to a negotiation for a lasting peace  with the assistance of the United Nations.With the situation in Cambodia we return to the subject of promising developments on the international scene - and that situation is certainly one of them. My country has always supported the untiring efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to help resolve this 11-year-old conflict. Now we may be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. The peace efforts of A8BAN and other nations have recently given reason to hopes of a political breakthrough soon. In this contest we are most heartened that the five permanent members of the Security Council have launched an initiative to help secure peace in Cambodia  and we hail their framework agreement as an important contribution in this direction. Security Council resolution 668 (1990) is a historic document and will definitely provide impetus to the Cambodian peace process. We should also like to express our special support for the roles played by the co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference - Indonesia and France. Australia and Japan also deserve particular mention for their constructive contributions to the peace negotiations. We urge all the Cambodian parties concerned and Viet Man to consider the higher interest· of the Cambodian people. It in time for national reconciliation centred around His Royal Highness Prince Norodon Sihanouk  who must continue to have a key role to play in the Cambodian peace settlement.In Central America we see the perseverance of regional leaders in working with the United Nations towards a peaceful resolution of an area's problems rewarded with success. The role played by the United Nations in the disarming and demobilisation of the Nicaraguan resistance - and even the destruction of weapons - and in observing the electoral process  as well as the current efforts of the United Nations to find solutions to the conflicts in 81 Salvador and Guatemala  demonstrate the innovativeness and flexibility of the United Nations in action today.The world rejoiced at the long-sought-after emergence of Namibia as an independent nation. The final act in Namibia’s long struggle to attain statehood was a fine example of a successful multilateral effort. It was a triumph not only for the United Nations but also for democratic principles and decolonisation  and we were pleased to see the Namibian constitution  based on respect for human rights and democratic principles  cone into force. We wish Namibia well. There is promising progress on the Western Saharan problem. Once again United Nations participation has resulted in an agreed set of proposals and a plan approved by the Security Council which should set in motion a timetable for the necessary steps towards self-determination. This referendum  convened under the auspices of the United Nations  should ensure a successful and peaceful outcome of the determination process.One of the early successes of the United Nations in this post-cold-war era of constructive co-operation was  of course  the comprehensive peace plan devised by the Security Council to put an end to the Iran-Iraq war. The continuing implementation of the plan under the watchful guidance of the Iran-Iraq Military Observatory Group to witness to the renewed vigour of the United Nations.Even in South Africa there are signs that the South African Government  heretofore one of the most cruel  stubborn and intransigent. may be beginning to acknowledge the dreadful error of its ways. With the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners. the partial lifting of the state of emergency and the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress (AMC) and other anti-apartheid groups  we hope that we are seeing the beginning of a new way of thinking on the part of the South African authorities and that we shall soon see definite steps taken to dismantle apartheid.On the peninsula of Korea we are pleased to see that talks have been taking place between the two Koreas at the level of the Prime Ministers. We should like to see these become substantive discussions leading to the formulation of a timetable for reunification. With the example of the unified Germany before them and the recent unification of Yemen  the Koreans should take heart and allow the spirit of compromise which now prevails to infuse these meetings. Our firm belief in the need for universality in world bodies leads us to support the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations. There is no question of this being a barrier to reunification. In fact  we think it will be a positive step end one which would encourage dialogue and co-operation between the two parties and hasten reunification.This is the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. So many of us have come to independence by way of the United Nations and know at firsthand the historic significance of this document. United Nations trusteeship over Western Samoa was terminated in 1962  following self-determination and a plebiscite in 1961  which found in favour of Matai - or chiefly ~ suffrage. Although this system is itself based on democratic principles  I am pleased to state in this Hall  29 years later  that on the 29th of this month we shall be holding a national referendum to determine whether or not the people of our country now wish to adopt universal suffrage.The International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism began this year  and we look forward  indeed  to the day when the self-determination process will be completed throughout the world. In our region  New Caledonia is making steady progress along the road to self-determination and the French authorities are continuing the positive measures promised to promote political  economic and social development in the Territory. We urge all parties to maintain the pace of progress and to continue the dialogue in the interests of all the people of New Caledonia and a peaceful path to self-determination.There is no doubt that the new climate of co-operation and partnership that has been fashioned by the courage and vision of the great world leaders of today has presented the world with political opportunities heretofore undreamt of to resolve regional conflicts that remain intractable and to address issues of concern to all citizens of the world.Concern for the universal good  global welfare and due regard for the legitimate concerns  and  indeed  for the very real fears of human beings throughout the world must surely be obligatory for responsible and enlightened leaders today.Individual nations must not have unhampered freedom obstinately to pursue actions that are repugnant and terrifying to others and that endanger the welfare of all. Nuclear testing in the Pacific and elsewhere must stop immediately. For 15 years now the frantic protests of the peoples of the Pacific against nuclear testing on fragile Mururoa Atoll have been completely ignored by one country which bad simply decided to embark on a testing programme  cone what might - a programme which so far has conducted over 100 nuclear explosions.In contrast  we are delighted to note Japan's decision to cease drift-net fishing in the Pacific a year before the date set in the resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year. We hope that the few who still practise this vile fishing method  wherever it occurs  will soon follow suit. Concerted efforts and strategies must be developed to protect the environment and to deal with the myriad problems that may be attributable to the greenhouse effect as well as the other environmental ills of this planet. We are optimistic that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  to be hold in Brazil in 1992  will provide a thorough and comprehensive review of our staggering global environmental problems. The Preparatory Committee  under the able guidance of Ambassador Tommy Koh of Singapore  has already begun important work.We ourselves were recently subject to the vagaries of nature  when we were hit early this year by the devastation of Cyclone Ofa  which did incalculable damage to our fragile environment. I should like to take this opportunity to thank all those who proffered aid in our hour of need - international organisations  countries  non-governmental organisations and private individuals. This year begins the International Decade for Natural Disaster Seduction  and we feel it is timely indeed.Timely also was the General Assembly's Declaration early this year on International Economic Co-operation  in particular the Revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries.We sincerely hope that the new  emerging challenges we are confronting today with respect to the political  economic  and social reforms taking place in Europe  coupled with the alarming crisis in the Middle East  will not affect too adversely and further burden the economies of the developing and least developed countries.As I come to the end of this statement  I feel that I must reiterate my optimism regarding the political climate of the coming decade  and I want to pay tribute to the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the emergence of this exciting new scenario. The pace of disarmament must intensify and the peace dividend we have heard so much about must become a reality  so that we can do the things to benefit humanity that we should have been doing all along.In particular  we want to see the situation of the world's children change immeasurably for the better. This is International Literacy Tear  and while we cannot underestimate the importance of literacy to the mental growth of a child  this is just one of so many things we must do to ameliorate the plight of our children. The 9forId Summit for Children in which we participated last weekend focused the world's attention on the frightening prospects for the world's future if we do not ensure that our children develop healthy in mind  body and soul. It is definitely time to re-order our priorities - to put the well-being of the world's children  and therefore the world's future  above all else. Mow is the time to turn fro  the insanity of war and weaponry to the fulfilment of the promise of the human race."
"153",7506,"YEM",45,1990,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to extend to the President our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session. I am confident that thanks to his wisdom and great abilities  he will lead this session to success  thus proving that the confidence we have in him is well placed. This confidence can also be attributed to the high esteem in which his friendly country  Malta  is held in the international community.I would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the previous President  Mr. Joseph Garba  for his efforts in the wise conduct of the previous session.He would like to renew our support for the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  and his consistent efforts aimed at realising the principles of the Charter.I would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratification at seeing among us the delegation of the independent State of Namibia  which has achieved its independence after a long struggle by its valiant people. I welcome Liechtenstein as a new Member of the United Nations  and congratulate the people of Germany on their great achievement  unity. I would like also to express our happiness at seeing the African leader. Nelson Mandela  free at last  pursuing his struggle  along with his people  for the complete elimination of the racist regime in South Africa.The most outstanding characteristic of this session is that it represents a rebirth of the United Nations  and ushers in a new era in the life and history of this international Organisation after 45 years of its existence and the end of the cold and the ideological war between the world's two principal blocs. It also marks the beginning of the end of the military alliances in East and Hest.This important historic development is characterized by the shift from confrontation to co-operation  the emergence of a new world order and a new system of international relations. This has taken the form of laws and frameworks which aim at consolidating co-operation between States pursuant to the Charter in a context of respect for the rule of law and the principles of the Charter.Foremost among those principles is the settlement of disputes between States by peaceful means  respect for international law as the basis of relations between States  and expansion of co-operation between States on the basis of the most fundamental of principles  such as the respect for sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs and the non-use of force. It is only natural that this most important  positive characteristic augurs well for peace.Previously  the Security Council was a mere paralysed organ that was made unable to perform its main duty under the Charter  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security. Its activities were limited to mitigating the consequences of armed conflicts by dispatching peace-keeping forces. This had become its most outstanding function. Previously  then  the Security Council was a mere organ  not for resolving political and military conflicts  but rather for deepening the political conflict between the two major blocs. Indeed  it had turned into an arena for record breaking in the use  or rather the abuse  of veto.Previously  too  the Security Council succeeded only in formulating a framework for resolving conflicts without being able to put an end to such conflicts. Thus  its resolutions became inapplicable theoretical formulae. The world lost interest in the Security Council's resolutions. Due to the paralysis of its decision-making mechanism and its inability to enforce its resolutions in line with the Charter  there grew a feeling that the Council did not have any real moral authority or political clout.That situation has changed now  and so has the General Assembly. It has changed from an arena of ideological conflict and propaganda to an important international forum where the intractable questions that interest mankind are thrashed out in a spirit of co-operation and with the purpose of finding practical solutions to such issues as disarmament  problems of socio-economic and the environment  and problems relating to the fight against drugs and terrorism  as well as problems of democratisation and the consolidation of human rights without discrimination or narrow interpretation. Notwithstanding  and in the teeth of all such international changes  the most important and complex problems of humanity  namely  the world's economic problems and  more specifically  the problems besetting the developing and the least developed countries  continue to worsen from one day to the next. The economic gap between the rich countries and the poor countries  on the one hand  and between the industrialised countries and the developing countries  on the other  continues to widen in a mind-boggling manner that threatens millions of people with poverty  famine and deprivation of the most basic necessities of subsistence. It has also threatened the political stability of many States. These problems pose threats which may immerse our world in a catastrophic situation whose dimensions and effects on international peace and security cannot be imagined.The situation has also changed with respect to the Security Council. We feel that we have reason for optimism when we see the beginning of the implementation of some of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council on Namibia  Central America  the Iran-Iraq conflict  Cambodia and Afghanistan. Yet  this positive picture remains incomplete as long as the Arab-Israeli conflict continues to be the only exception to the rule followed by the Security Council. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which constitute the framework for the political settlement in the Middle East  have not been affected by international changes up to this very moment  especially with the world having discovered the true ability of the Security Council to deal with matters which threaten international peace and security  and its ability to guarantee international commitment to its resolutions.In this regard  the Republic of Yemen calls for a solution to the complex  chronic problems of interest to the Arab region  foremost among which is the question of the Palestinian Arab people  through the same perspective and through the application of the same criteria which affirm the principles of inadmissibility of the occupation of territory by force  the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories including Jerusalem  the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon  to ensure the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon and to establish the independent Palestinian State  as well as the adoption of immediate steps to halt Jewish immigration to the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories.While Chapter VII of the Charter was like a jammed weapon  the world suddenly discovered the standing of the Security Council as an international authority that can impose its resolutions with many effective manners  In less than two months  the Security Council adopted nine decisive resolutions to face the most important crisis that erupted during this year in the Gulf region. If the United Nations is the mirror of our world  then what we see in it  whether in the Security Council or in the General Assembly  faithfully reflects the tremendous developments which have led the world from confrontation to co-operation and led to the collapse of all walls  be they physical like the Berlin Hall or mere psychological and ideological walls that used to divide the world. The criteria and the rules of the Charter of the United Nations have thus become dominant  and have taken precedence over all other criteria.This generation is entitled to welcome the transition from one stage to another in international relations. All have contributed to this transition to varying degrees  and our people in Yemen has made its contribution on the national level in Yemen. The wall which had separated the two parts of the Yemeni homeland came down before the collapse of the Berlin Hall. Thus  our people has given expression to the spirit of our time  not only through the collapse of the psychological and political walls between the sons of the same homeland  but also through the achievement of the dearest wish to the hearts of the Yemeni people  that is  the unity of the Yemeni homeland and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen  which were achieved on 22 May 1990. The establishment of Yemeni unity is  in itself  a great landmark in our contemporary history  yet the value of this historic development is all the greater in view of the manner in which it was achieved. It was achieved by peaceful means and on a solid democratic basis. Its main pillar is the Constitution of the unified State  which is the fruit of 20 years of constructive debate among the finest jurists  scientists  clergymen and other groups in Yemeni society. Thus  the Constitution of the unified State emphasises the finest elements of the Shura heritage of Yemeni history and the totality of human experience in democratic rule. Therefore  with the establishment of a unified State  our people had two celebrations  to celebrate the restoration of the unity of the homeland and the establishment of the unified State and the inauguration of democratic practice enshrined in the Constitution  based on the rule of the people  respect for human dignity and the guarantee of equal political rights to all citizens of Yemen  men and women  the old and the young  without any discrimination. It guarantees the enjoyment by all the citizens of Yemen of all the principal freedoms  including the freedom of expression  the freedom of the press  the freedom to establish political parties and the freedom of political opposition  in addition to the separation of powers  the independence of the judiciary  regular elections for the change of Government and political and economic pluralism in an atmosphere of entente and the rule of law.I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to all the heads of delegations who have congratulated us on the achievement of Yemeni unity and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen. While the world was proceeding towards the definition of the new international order  after only three Months of the establishment of the unified State of Yemen  the crisis in the Gulf erupted. It has confronted the Republic of Yemen as well as the emerging international order with a difficult test that will determine the nature and development of the new international order and international relations.The storming of the State of Kuwait by Iraqi troops on 2 August 1990 was at direct violation with the principles governing relations between States  such as the non-use of force for the settlement of disputes  the inadmissibility of the violation of the sovereignty of an independent State and the illegitimacy of the annexation of the territories of others by force. From the very first moment  the Republic of Yemen  due to its awareness of the gravity of the crisis  and by virtue of its adherence to Arab nationalism and its geographical importance on the Arab peninsula  the Gulf and the Red Sae spared no effort in trying to contain the crisis between the two brotherly countries within an Arab framework and to search for a solution by peaceful  fraternal means.We had hoped that those Arab efforts would result in a speedy solution to the crisis. But  most regrettably  other Powers moved in to derail any Arab attempt to solve the crisis and nip it in the bud. Heavy concentrations of foreign troops began to head towards the region  further complicating and escalating the crisis until it reached its current high degree of gravity  which threatens the security and stability of the region and jeopardises international peace and security.In a statement on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the revolution of 26 September  General Ali Abdulla Salah  Chairman of the Presidential Council  reaffirmed our country's position. He said:""Our position vis-à-vis the crisis in the Gulf has been based on the need to respect the sovereignty and independence of all Arab countries  and on the inadmissibility of occupying the territory of others or resorting to the use of force to solve problems. We have proceeded from the assumption that the principles governing relations between all States of the world must be equally respected and guaranteed between the countries of the Arab nation. That makes it necessary for problems between Arab countries to be resolved within the one Arab family. Therefore  we have insisted and will continue to insist that the peaceful solution acceptable to both parties must be an Arab one  without foreign intervention."" I should like to make the following points in summary of our view of the settlement of the Gulf crisis and the restoration of peace  security and stability there.First  Yemen has not and will not approve the occupation of the land of others by fore·. It did not support Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Secondly  the Republic of Yemen will continue to search for an Arab solution to the crisis that takes into account the causes that led to it and would lead to the withdrawal of Iraqi troops and guarantee the independence and sovereignty of Kuwait. Thirdly  the Republic of Yemen calls for allowing all foreign civilians in Iraq and Kuwait to leave the region. Fourthly  our country does not condone sending of foreign forces to the region end calls for their withdrawal. Fifthly  the Republic of Yemen reaffirms its commitment to Security Council resolution 661 (1990). It has supported Security Council resolution 670 (1990) as an expression of its support for a peaceful solution of the crisis between Iraq and Kuwait and in order to avert the option of war that is being advocated by certain Powers. Mar is an option fraught with dangers and destruction  and would lead to a veritable catastrophe that will do grave damage to the States and peoples of the region and spill over into other parts of that world.While the Republic of Yemen reaffirms its adherence to the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait  it calls upon the international community to provide it with immediate compensation for the direct effects of its adherence to resolution 661 (1990). Those effects are estimated at no least 11 384 million through the loss of remittances by Yemen ex-patriots  in addition to the loss of 2.5 million tons of crude oil. There are also indirect effects that reflect on the performance of our national economy  as well as the grave difficulties faced by Yemen's balance of payments during this critical stage of our history. In conclusion  it must be recognized that the future of the new international order  which constitutes our hope for the future  is contingent upon the choice between war and peace in our region and throughout the world. If successive speakers have insisted on the need to opt for peace  our collective task is to promote a peaceful search for the desired results of restoring normalcy  security and stability to the region. To that sad  we must adopt and develop all available positive initiatives  among which is that made by the President of France  Mr. François Mitterrand.It was an auspicious coincidence that Yemen should contribute to the transition towards a new international order at an important juncture of its history  culminating in the achievement of Yemen’s unification by peaceful  democratic means. Yemen assures the international community that  through its membership in the Security Council  it will continue to work with the other members of the Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. To that end  Yemen will spare no effort in faithfully reflecting all questions of interest to Arab countries and peoples."
"154",7553,"YUG",45,1990,"﻿It gives me distinct pleasure to see a representative of Malta presiding over this year's session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should also like to express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria for his successful presidency during the forty-fourth session.I should like to welcome the new Member of the United Nations  the Principality of Liechtenstein.We all owe special appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  who continues to make an all-round contribution to the efforts being made by the United Nations to solve the most topical world problems.The decades at the end of the twentieth century will be recorded in history as years of historic transformation in the relations between States and peoples as well as of social  political and economic changes in many countries.Relations in today's world are characterised by substantially intensified co-operation and dialogue between the two super-Powers  by a new structure in Europe and the continent's growth into a single political and economic space and by processes of regional integration in other parts of the world as wall. Economic  financial and technological potential and interests are becoming the new foundations for co-operation. However such positive developments do not preclude uncertainties and the possibility of retrogressive trends. The dangers of local and regional conflicts  as attested to by the recent Iraqi aggression against Kuwait  have not yet been averted.We are convinced that prospects for building a new  more balanced and democratic system of international relations have been opened up and that this will be a long-term tread in the world's development.As a member of the international community Yugoslavia is vitally interested in seeing these positive processes gain momentum  encompass all fields of international relations and all parts of the world and bring equal prosperity and well-being to all nations of the world. However  the attainment of that objective is still far away  for we live in a world encumbered by the legacy of an epoch we hope we have definitely left behind.Inspired by that goal and desirous of contributing to its realisation  Yugoslavia opted for the policy of non-alignment and has for three decades been working actively in the international field with a large group of States  the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Since the ninth Summit Conference of countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement  held at Belgrade in 1989  Yugoslavia  as its Chairman  has been seeking to make the Movement's activities responsive to the profound and rapid changes taking place in the world.Through contacts with the most important factors in the world advocating international dialogue and co-operation Yugoslavia has been urging all elements of the international community to take up the key challenge confronting mankind - namely  the solution of problems of development  from which flow all the other challenges before us  from the ecological to the health and social problems of the developing countries  which still constitute two thirds of the world.The spectacular improvement in international relations and the overall international climate  as well as the elimination of global confrontations between the super-Powers and blocs  cannot conceal the difficult economic position of and grave conflict situations in many developing countries. The prerequisite for a tranquil and stable world is to complement the East-West political detente with an economic and social one between North and South.We believe that owing to its nature and history  as well as to its ability to bring together and co-ordinate global and regional interests  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is in a position to play a significant role in creating a new balance in the world which would have a decisive effect on international developments in the coming years and over a longer period  and in which all influential and concerned elements would find their own interest.There is no doubt that Europe  the continent of which Yugoslavia is a part  is currently undergoing profound changes. In the past year substantive democratic changes have taken place there. Their protagonists are the people - man as a free and creative agent  a new and different Europe is being shaped before our very eyes  but its future is not without uncertainties. As one example  there is the disturbing growth of extreme forms of nationalism and intolerance  from which hardly a single area of Europe is immune. Or let us take the disproportionate level of development of certain areas of the continent  which threatens to replace the outmoded system of blocs with a new system that is longer-lasting and more difficult to surmount. The solution of such problems is imperative if we are to create a truly united and stable Europe in which no one feels himself the citizen of a second-rate nation. Stability in Europe can be attained only if the principle of the integrity and sovereignty of States is consistently observed. Today  regrettably  the General Assembly of the United Nations witnessed a flagrant attack by the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of my country. Openly - before this Assembly and before the entire world public - he called for the establishment of yet another Albanian State  this time on the territory of Yugoslavia. It is very important for the international public that he openly and publicly presented that which had long been concealed in Albania's policy towards Yugoslavia. The General Assembly is fully aware of the fact that nowhere in the world - in not a single State - do national minorities have the right to establish a State of their own and to secede. Such an unrealisable intention of Albanian separatists is the reason for all their conflicts with the authorities in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia  which are unjustifiably referred to as threats to human rights.Yugoslavia would be satisfied if Albania were to ensure that the Yugoslav national minorities living in Albania were given those rights that the Albanians in Yugoslavia enjoy.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) has become an even more comprehensive process and an essential factor in the development of a new European architecture. With the creation of a new system of relations in Europe  it is only natural that the CSCE  as the sole all-European democratic forum  should be the framework for the development of all forms of co-operation and new ties in Europe. There is no doubt that the neutral and non-aligned countries will  as always  make a constructive contribution to this process.As an open country and an active member of the international community  Yugoslavia is also going through a period of deepest change in its own internal socio-political development. The introduction of political pluralism  a multi-party system and free elections on that basis has been accompanied by instability which  to a significant extent  is a consequence of democratisation and the country's multinational nature.Also  before many others did so  we had opted to seek solutions to our own development problems through a market-economy mechanism. We are aware of the fact that the movement towards a free market is bound to give rise to acute social and other problems. That  in a way  characterizes present-day developments in Yugoslavia. However  we are convinced that we are on the right track and that the reforms that are under way in Yugoslavia will continue to meet with the support and understanding of the broadest spectrum of countries.I avail myself of this opportunity to express my country's deepest concern over the further dangerous aggravation of the crisis in the Gulf  which was caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. In its own right  and as Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Yugoslavia once again most resolutely condemns the act of aggression against  and the annexation of  Kuwait  which it considers to be null and void; reaffirms its full support for the legitimate Government of Kuwait; and most resolutely calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from the territory of Kuwait  for respect for that country's sovereignty  and for the re-establishment of its territorial integrity  which remains the only way of resolving the crisis.The latest events in the Gulf region have once again confirmed that the United Nations is the proper forum for finding ways out of critical situations in international relations. We advocate the consistent implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions  as well as further consultations  within the United Nations  on all measures aimed at the prevention of an escalation. Therefore we believe that action on the part of the international community  including the placing of military forces in the Gulf  should be taken with the utmost discipline and responsibility. I am certain that it is in the interests of the entire international community that war be prevented - the consequences of war are unforeseeable - and that the state of affairs that existed prior to the invasion of Kuwait be restored. We welcome all processes aimed at the initiation of a political solution to the crisis  and we are ready to participate in them.The events in the Gulf region attest once again to the closest interrelationship between political and economic factors. This crisis and the uncertainties that it has created pose a serious threat to the economies of many countries  Yugoslavia included  as well as to the world economy as a whole. Such an unexpected upheaval in the world economy has increased the existing  already-chronic  difficulties resulting from excessive external debt  falls in raw-material prices  hampered exports  protectionism  lack of capital  and so on.Regrettably  this has happened at precisely the time when developing countries  particularly the highly indebted and least developed ones  have been making enormous efforts  through reforms  coupled with great sacrifices  as well as social and political tensions  to steer their economies towards growth and development.Therefore it is up to all countries - both the developed and the underdeveloped ones - as well as competent international institutions  primarily the United Nations  to take appropriate measures to ward off the extremely adverse consequences that there could be for international economic co-operation and development.This situation is further aggravated by persistent trouble spots in other parts of the world ~ the Middle East crisis being one of the most serious. We must not lose sight of the fact that this is one of the most protracted world crises. It continues to be a source of tension and is permanently the focus of attention. The stalemate in the Middle East stands in contrast to the positive trends in international relations generally.Any solution to this crisis must include the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including their right to a State of their own and the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied since 1967  as well as guarantees of peace and security for all countries of the region within internationally recognized boundaries. Obviously the best way to attain this goal would be to convene an international conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1969) and 338 (1973) - a proposal that was unanimously approved by the Heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries at their Ninth Conference.I believe that it is with a feeling of shared success that we welcome to the General Assembly a new full-fledged member - the sovereign and independent Republic of Namibia. Major changes are under way in southern Africa. We hope that we have reached a stage when the elimination of apartheid - a shameful system of discrimination - is just a matter of time. The immediate and lasting abolition of apartheid should be our common priority.We particularly support the current processes aimed at settling the Kampuchean problem. We also believe that acceptable solutions should be found  as soon as possible  to the issues of Cyprus  Western Sahara and Afghanistan  as well as that of the peaceful unification of Korea. I feel that I express the views of the majority when I say that action to deal with new global problems  such as those related to drugs  the environment and childcare should be the focus of attention of the international community.Representatives are aware of the fact that child care will be on the agenda of the summit that begins tomorrow. Yugoslavia unreservedly supports the noble and humane objectives of this top-level gathering.IN today's world of growing interdependence between States and peoples  the universal value of human rights and their all-around importance for assessing the acceptability of a country's policies have been reaffirmed in very strong terms.Yugoslavia believes that the degree to which an individual enjoys these rights and fundamental freedoms is a yardstick for measuring the extent of democratisation in a society and its capacities to take part in wider democratic processes taking place in the world. We share the growing conviction that it is necessary fully to observe human rights and freedoms  both collective and individual  mindful of the fact that civil and political rights cannot be separated from economic and social ones.The positive changes in East-West relations have contributed to the weakening or elimination of the last strongholds of resistance to accepting international standards in the field of human rights  including the rights of minorities. The rule is being affirmed that human rights and civil liberties are not only general values  but also an obligation and a criterion for evaluating the nature and achievements of any social system.Gone are the times when the big Powers and blocs shunned the United Nations or treated the General Assembly as a propaganda platform rather than as a forum for resolving the principal international problems. Given some of the reforms carried in the United Nations itself  especially in addressing the financial crisis  and even more so the possibilities of revitalisation as a consequence of the negotiations and agreements reached between the super-Powers and the more favourable climate in international relations in general  new prospects are being opened up concerning the effectiveness of this world Organisation.The times have changed indeed. So has the Movement of non-aligned countries  and so have its possibilities. Over a long period of time  in parallel with the struggle for the emancipation of countries and peoples  with efforts aimed at restructuring world relations and imbuing them with a spirit of partnership  solidarity and co-operation  the Movement also constantly opposed bloc polarisation. The non-aligned consider the favourable developments taking place in the present-day world to be the fulfilment of their own objectives as well  to a large extent. The preconditions have been met for further  positive evolution. May I  as Chairman of the Movement  briefly point out the areas in which fulfilment of these preconditions should and must be encouraged?First of all  in the general international climate: the events taking place in Europe and also global developments indicate that a new world order is being ushered in  in a major way  one in which there are no enemies or rivals  but only competitors and partners.Secondly  in the economic and social sphere  in which the existing discrepancies cannot remain unaddressed it is not only that these discrepancies generate new tensions which could pull us all backwards  but also that they prevent a new quality of life - ranging from human rights to environmental protection - iron prevailing at a global level.Thirdly  in dealing with world crises along the lines we mentioned  we should encourage the parallel strengthening of confidence-building measures  negotiating and control mechanisms within the United Nations  as well as all other forms of multilateral organisation inspired by the Charter of this world Organisation.Lastly  but perhaps most important: fulfilment of these preconditions must be encouraged within the United Nations itself. This finest hour that it is experiencing  for the first time since the days of the cold war and for the first time in post-war history  means that the United Nations is becoming a place in which issues are being resolved and in which they can indeed be resolved: this is not only the vision of the founders come true  but also a great obligation on all of us. If the United Nations has finally assumed its proper role  then it is capable of being both a peacemaker and· a strong instrument of collective security  which implies that  is each and every member country  the game should have new  democratic rules and that all should have economic prosperity and political stability. In the process of pursuing all these objectives  the Movement of non-aligned countries is prepared to work even harder as a factor in world reintegration and in the further emancipation of individuals and nations."
"155",7617,"ZMB",45,1990,"﻿I join the speakers who have preceded me in congratulating you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. We are living in critical times characterised by revolutionary changes in world politics. My delegation is therefore pleased that a seasoned and well-respected leader is guiding the work of this Assembly  We have no doubt that  given your vast experience in international affairs  you will steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion. Your predecessor  Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria  presided over the last session with exemplary seal at a time of unprecedented developments  particularly in Eastern Europe and southern Africa. Indeed  the world witnessed during his tenure of office the successful implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  leading to the independence of Namibia. We commend him most sincerely for his tireless efforts in the promotion of global peace.It is with great pride that my delegation welcomes the Republic of Namibia as a Member of the United Nations. We are happy that the independence of Namibia has closed the sad chapter of colonialism on the continent of Africa.My delegation is also delighted to welcome in our midst the Principality of Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein's admission to the world body brings us a step closer towards the realisation of the goal of universality.I also wish to take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for the commendable efforts he continues to make in the promotion of international peace and security.Since we last met to review the complex issues confronting the world  a number of events have come to pass. Of these  the most important is  of course  the welcome improvement in the relations between the super-Powers  resulting in the end of the cold-war era and in the emergence of a process towards the elimination of hotbeds of tension in the world.Forty-five years ago the founding fathers of our Organisation envisioned a world in which peace and security would be preserved through international co-operation and understanding. With the end of the cold war  mankind has  for the first time since the end of the Second World War  an opportunity to bring about the realisation of that vision through the abolition of nuclear and chemical weapons and the reduction of conventional weapons throughout the world. Against this background  my delegation welcomes the recent positive achievements in the area of arms control and disarmament. In this regard  the agreement to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons  which was signed between the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987  represents an important corner-stone and a good beginning. Since then  efforts aimed at a reduction in strategic missiles have continued. We look forward to an agreement on a treaty on strategic missiles  which we hope will be signed soon. The ultimate goal  however  remains the eventual complete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the face of the Earth. To achieve that goal  there has to be a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  which will forbid improvements in weapon systems of mass destruction. We have also welcomed the continuing efforts aimed at the projected destruction of stockpiles of chemical weapons  and we call for a total ban on the manufacture of those destructive weapons. We have followed with great interest the negotiation in Vienna on the reduction of conventional weapons in Europe. We welcome the progress made and we congratulate those involved in the negotiations.Let me now turn to southern Africa. The front-line States continue to follow events in South Africa with keen interest and some concern. While we have welcomed the ""talks about talks"" between the African National Congress of South Africa and the Government  which have resulted in the Groote Schuur end Pretoria Minutes  we remain concerned about the increase in violence in black townships in recent times  which has led to great loss of life and property.We reaffirm our call on the Government of South Africa to end without further delay the ongoing violence in townships and deal with those who are behind it. At the same time we urge all anti-apartheid organisations in South Africa to demonstrate unity of purpose against their common enemy  the apartheid system itself.The international community has a binding responsibility to ensure that apartheid is eradicated. The Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa we adopted by consensus last December remains a blueprint for establishing a climate conducive to negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination of apartheid.We are delighted that the Assembly continues to remain unanimous in its conclusions that the measures taken thus far by the South African regime do not constitute profound and irreversible change  as called for in the Declaration  and that therefore this 'ί not the time to relax the existing sanctions against South Africa. Our judgement remains that the oppressed people of South Africa  which the sanctions were intended to support in their struggle against apartheid  are the best judges of how and when the sanctions should be removed. In Angola talks between the government and UNITA aimed at a peaceful solution for the conflict in that country are under way. We appeal to those external Powers aiding UMITA to stop such assistance so that negotiations can take place in an atmosphere free of violence. Similarly  in Mozambique the peace initiatives of the government should be encouraged and supported. In both Angola and Mozambique  millions of people have been displaced by the wars imposed on those countries from outside. As a result  many children  women and old people continue to suffer from the effects of destabilisation. We appeal to the international community to extend humanitarian assistance to both Angola and Mozambique.The front-line States and the other neighbouring States in southern Africa  which have suffered great devastation in both human and material terms at the hands of the apartheid regime  also need international assistance to enable them to rebuild their economies. Indeed  South Africa's policy of destabilisation against neighbouring States through the use of its proxies continues unabated. In the case of own country  the activities of the RENAMO bandits are on the increase  suffering in great loss of life and property. The most recent case took place on 20 September 1990 in the Eastern Province of Zambia  in which an ambush by BEHAMO resulted in the death of 10 Zambians and the destruction of several vehicles. It is against this background that we reiterate our call for increased assistance to the affected countries to rebuild their economies as called for in the declaration.We are saddened by the civil war in Liberia  which has brought about untold suffering among innocent civilians. We appeal to the international community to send urgent humanitarian assistance to the people of Liberia to alleviate their suffering. We welcome the regional initiative taken by the countries members of the Economic Community of West African States (BCOHAS) in helping to bring peace to Liberia. In Western Sahara  we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General as well as of the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity tot their continuing efforts towards the holding of a referendum for self-determination.With regard to Cambodia  we welcome the unity of purpose displayed by the Cambodian people that has resulted is the formation of the Supreme national Council. We commend the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for their contribution to this development. We look forward to a peaceful transition within the framework of the plan by the five permanent members of the Security Council.Zambia congratulates the people of Yemen for the historic decision to merge their divided country into a single republic.In Korea  we welcome the talks by the Prime Ministers of the two countries. We hope that this interaction will lead to the realization of the aspirations of the Korean people to achieve unity through peaceful means. In the same spirit  Zambia warmly welcomes the reunification of Germany.In Afghanistan  it remains our hope that recent talks between the United States and the Soviet Union will pave the way to the achievement of a lasting peace in that troubled country.In the case of Cyprus  we note with regret that  despite the efforts of the international community to find a solution to the problems of that country  there appears to be little progress in that regard. We therefore appeal to the Secretary-General to persevere in his efforts to resolve the crisis and urge the parties concerned to co-operate with him.In Central America  we are gladly witnessing a transformation from conflict to an unprecedented atmosphere of national and regional reconciliation. We hope that this process will ultimately lead to lasting regional peace  stability and development. We view the recent event  in the Gulf region with great concern. Zambia maintain· good relations with both Kuwait and Iraq  which are fellow members of the Mon-Aligned Movement. In the context of our friendly relations with both of them  we have called on Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and urged both countries to resolve any outstanding differences between then through negotiations.The Gulf crisis has given rise to many ramifications. One of these is the apparent relegation to the background of the question of Palestine. The plight of the Palestinians  of which this Assembly has been seized since 1948  must be addressed with the same ferocity and determination as is being shown in the case of the Gulf crisis. It should be remembered that there will be no real peace in the Middle East until the rights of the Palestinian people are justly addressed.Zambia continues to believe that an international conference should be convened under the auspices of the United Nations at which all parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PL0)  should be represented. This is the only way the concerns of Israel  the PLO and the rest of the Arab nations can be addressed.Secondly  the Gulf crisis has given rise to serious economic and financial problems. I am referring  for example  to the loss of revenue suffered by those countries that are close to the region and that are required by the international community to participate in the enforcement of the sanctions. The international community is making efforts to minimise the financial losses suffered by these countries. However  nothing so far is being done to assist them  especially the oil-importing countries in Africa  whose external positions have been adversely affected by the escalation in oil prices. I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to come to the assistance of those countries  including Zambia  whose economies are being seriously disrupted as a result of the Gulf crisis.The third aspect of the Gulf crisis relates to policy and  in particular  to the enforcement of Security Council resolutions. Since the beginning of the Gulf crisis  much has been said in this Assembly and in the Security Council itself about the principle of the inadmissibility of acquiring territory by force. This  of course  is a cardinal principle in international relations  and we in Zambia subscribe fully to it. We do believe  however  that this noble principle should be universally applied whereas it is of course within the competence of the United Nations to demand that one country should withdraw its forces from another  whose territory it is occupying vi et armis  that demand should apply equally to all countries whose forces are illegally occupying the territories of others. It is only in this way that double standards will be avoided and confidence in our Organisation enhanced.Let me touch now on a number of economic and social issues. The reduction in ideological tensions and the resultant improved atmosphere for political discourse are providing us with a unique opportunity now and in the coming decades to bring the pressing issue of economic co-operation to the top of the global agenda. For many years now  this question has lingered unresolved and  as a result  economic growth and development have not been attained worldwide. On the contrary  the position of developing countries  especially in Africa  has continued to worsen.Innovation  far-sightedness  imagination and statesmanship are needed to resolve the question of economic relations  especially those between North and South. The status quo cannot be consolidated any further without risking global instability. Problems such as the net transfer of financial resources from the developing countries  which amounted to $26 billion last year  simply cannot continue without destroying the basis for future co-operation.Recent innovations and initiatives in respect of the external debt crisis  which has been with us since 1982  offer some hope. The Toronto summit initiative  the Brady strategy and the recent British and French initiatives come to mind here. But for many countries that are affected  more requires to be done to mobilise resources for investment which will enable then to grow out of the debt problem.One aspect of the debt crisis is that an increasing number of low-income countries are finding themselves owing much of their debt to multilateral financial institutions. The burden of servicing the debts owed these preferred creditors has become inconsistent with resumed growth and creditworthiness  and is an issue which requires additional and new solutions.The field of trade policy is full of uncertainties as to what direction the international trading system will take. Experts advise us that the results of the Uruguay Round will be modest if the current mood surrounding the negotiations prevails. The positions of developed countries on the issues of subsidies  tariffs  quantitative restrictions and other non-tariff barriers exhibit an unwillingness on their part to establish new rules of trade within the principle of free trade.Issues pertaining to the environment and development have acquired especial importance  and deserve global recognition. Indeed  this is as it should be. It is heartening to note the common commitment to the preservation of our environment  which it manifesting itself in a new spirit of international co-operation. In this regard  we in Zambia look forward with keen interest to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The irresistible interest of the international community in the issues of human rights and democracy and in their relation to questions of economic development signifies a deep-rooted desire for human progress to be anchored in justice  equity and self-sustainability. Zambia welcomes this growing interest. The record of human rights and democracy in Zambia is true to the ideals of social justice and fair play. The Zambian Government is keen to respond to the democratic aspirations of all the people of Zambia  and works relentlessly to maintain this position; our latest move is towards pluralistic politics  which will be used to consolidate our democratic traditions and institutions.However  there are some odd notions  on the issues of human rights and democracy  which need to be discarded by the international community. There is a need  for example  to discard the tendency to think that a few countries are the pillars of human rights and democracy and that all the others must be measured by how close they come to the likeness of those few countries. The diverse cultures and history of the human race  which was bred and is sustained in circumstances that are in no way uniform  should be sufficient impetus for en early demise of such notions. What is required is for each country to develop institutions and structures that are appropriate to its own experience and reflect the needs and wishes of its people.The insidious scourge of drugs leaves no room for complacency. International co-operation against the illicit production  supply  trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  and against the demand for them  must be intensified. Similarly  the problem of AIDS calls for the international community to evolve more strategies for its containment and eradication. The incidence of the disease is growing and is in many cases threatening the family unit. We need to counter this danger with the degree of activism to be expected from a society threatened with extinction.   Zambia attaches great importance to the welfare of children. In this regard  we welcome the recent adoption by this Assembly of the World Declaration on the Survival  Protection and Development of the Child  and of the Plan of Action. Along with the adoption of the Convention on the Sights of the Child and other related instruments  the international community has now firmly established the political and executive frameworks for fostering the emergence of an enabling environment where all our children  and their children  can develop without the violence of neglect  deprivation  abuse and exploitation.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate our belief that  given the political will  the States Members of the United Nations can make our Organisation play the important role for which it was created  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of co-operation and understanding between States so as to ensure the success of multilateralism. The world needs peace and economic prosperity.As we approach the last decade of the twentieth century  let us  in the spirit of the prevailing international political order  work together to enhance collective security in order to ensure a peaceful and stable world for the generations of the next century and beyond. "
"156",7651,"ZWE",45,1990,"﻿Allow me  Sir  first of all to extend to you warm felicitations upon your election as President of the Assembly. We are fully confident that you will carry out the responsibilities of your high office with great skill and efficiency. The Zimbabwe delegation wishes you success and pledges to you its fullest co-operation.Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria  for his able and inspiring leadership of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.The forty-fifth session of the Assembly meets at a historic turning-point in international relations. Since joining the community of nations  Zimbabwe  as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  which was founded in the contest of resistance to the formation of power blocs  has consistently argued against bloc politics. The dramatic developments we have witnessed since the opening of the last session portend a decade of the 1990s replete with fresh hopes and tantalising possibilities. A few months ago  the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  meeting in London  declared that the cold war was over and that they no longer regarded the countries of the Warsaw Pact as adversaries. Zimbabwe naturally welcomes and applauds this historic shedding of the cold war and of the bloc mentality that characterised it. It is a decisive development which opens real possibilities of crossing the threshold into a now international order in which mankind can at last be free from the fear of a nuclear conflict.The easing of tensions between the two super-Powers has already yielded tangible results and generated some positive trends in international affairs; a new atmosphere now prevails in the international political arena. With bloc polities on the wane  attempts at distorting the struggle of peoples for independence and human dignity by placing them in the context of East-Hast rivalries have also lessened.This positive trend enabled the United Nations finally to implement its plan for Namibian independence. enabling the Assembly to welcome a free Namibia to its midst last April. Also in Central America  Kampuchea  the Iran-Iraq conflict and Afghanistan where previously the infusion of bloc politics had militated against peaceful solutions the new international climate has allowed some movement towards resolution of those regional conflicts. At the international level  the new atmosphere has also made possible important agreements in the fields of disarmament and the environment and raised the general level of international co-operation.As we stand at a historic moment when the collective efforts of all nation· are directed towards the enlargement of international peace and security  we cannot suppress our dismay and revulsion at the incomprehensible and unfortunate act of aggression by a Member State against another  the invasion of Kuwait by the Republic of Iraq. By first invading and later annexing a sister State  both a Member of the United Nations and a member of the Hon-Aligned Movement  Iraq has violated the basic tenets of the Charter of the United Nations and those of the Non-Aligned Movement. Zimbabwe unreservedly condemns that act of naked aggression and calls upon Iraq  a friend and ally of Zimbabwe  to respect under international law the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. Accordingly  Zimbabwe has already declared its preparedness to discharge its international obligations under Chapter VII of the Chapter. Notwithstanding that policy position  we remain ready to resume normal and mutually beneficial relations with the Republic of Iraq.Equally  we appeal to those States with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to be guided in their actions by the Charter. We affirm the right and responsibility of the Security Council to take decisions which help to defuse the crisis and to alleviate the suffering of various foreign nationals who were caught up in the conflict. We also wish to urge the Secretary-General to continue to explore all possibilities for ending the entire conflict at the earliest possible date.Apartheid still remains a very strong fact of everyday life in South Africa  necessitating our continued attention to this issue. We are  of course  encouraged that many South Africans of all races are now agreed that apartheid has to gives way to a new constitutional dispensation in that country  and we therefore appeal to their leaders  in particular to State President De Klerk and to Comrade Nelson Mandela  Deputy President of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  to persevere in their search for a peaceful end to apartheid. A process as historic as the one in which the South Africans are engaged is bound to attract the wrath of those elements bent on preserving a thoroughly discredited social order. In our view  the South African leaders should remain committed to the historic objective of realizing a new and democratic South Africa acceptable to the majority  if not to all the people of that country. The international community  for its part  must continue to send clear and unambiguous signals to the Pretoria authorities regarding its readiness to take collective action in the interest of peace in South Africa. To that end  we welcome the Secretary-General's report on the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on South Africa. In that Declaration  Member States agreed;""To ensure that the international community does not relax existing measures aimed at encouraging the South African regime to eradicate apartheid until there is clear evidence of profound and irreversible changes.”At this historic moment for South Africa  the international community should be encouraged by the courage of South African leaders to meet the challenge before them o It would be most regrettable if some members of the international community unilaterally disengaged themselves from the commitments in the United Nations Declaration. Any such deviation would send negative signals which might act as an obstacle in the negotiation process.We continue to be perturbed by a lack of progress towards a comprehensive solution to the Middle East question. In this context  we welcomed the initiation of the dialogue between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as a useful exchange which could facilitate the removal of obstacles in the path towards a comprehensive resolution of the problem. We regret the interruption of that dialogue and hope that it will be resumed soon. We also call upon Israel to desist from settling arriving immigrants in the occupied territories  as such actions will lead to new antagonisms that can only make more difficult the search for solutions. There has been achieved a meeting of minds in the international community on the elements that could constitute a lasting solution to the Kampuchean question. We believe that a more constructive attitude from the parties directly involved would greatly assist in the search for such a solution. Meanwhile  we urge outside parties to refrain from supplying arms  which only help to fuel the conflict. To facilitate the search for a solution  it is also essential that the Supreme National Council agreed upon by the parties at the recent Jakarta meeting should be constituted without delay and be allowed to represent the Kampuchean people here at the United NationsIt is matter of deep regret that there has been no progress on the question of Cyprus over the past year. A solution to this important question will immensely contribute to reinforcing the current positive international climate. So  too  will all serious efforts aimed at uniting the two Koreas. This is why we welcome the meeting between the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea recently held in Seoul. We hope that the process of dialogue that is now under way will succeed in removing this unacceptable vestige of the cold war.Threats to the prevailing international political climate do not emanate from these remaining unresolved regional crises alone. Other persistent and deepening economic crises threaten to undo the gains so far realized in the political arena. The economies of most countries in Africa  Latin America and West Asia continued to decline during the past decade under the crushing burden of debilitating external debt  the collapse of commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade. The current volatility in the price of oil has further destabilized the already shaky world economy and wreaked havoc upon the economies of the energy-importing developing countries  such as my own. A further decline in the economic growth rates of most developing countries is now inevitable as a result of the crisis created by events in the Gulf.The situation in the South is desperate. The World Bank  in its World Development Report 1990  reveals that in the 1980s there were over 1 billion people in developing countries classified as living in conditions of poverty  compared to 25 million in the developed countries. The World Bank further forecasts that the situation is unlikely to get better in the 1990s. In our age of the global village  it is inconceivable that nations can live in peace with each other in a world of such glaring disparities in the quality of life between the North and the South. The world does not have to wait for the eruption of a crisis of the nature we recently witnessed before addressing this problem. The question of equitable distribution of the benefits of development is not a case of being one's brother’s keeper but rather one of sharing a common destiny.A new era characterized by international co-operation aimed at resolving the problems afflicting the world economy is essential. Zimbabwe feels heartened that  arising from last April's special session on international economic co-operation there is a new spirit and unanimous commitment by the international community to address the economic challenges facing the developed countries through international co-operation. It is indeed important that all the commitments contained in the Declaration adopted at that special session should be fulfilled. As Zimbabwe's contribution to the liberalisation of international trade  the Government has adopted far-reaching economic policy measures. These are intended to liberalise trade and to revamp the national economy. Zimbabwe therefore wishes to appeal to the international community and to the various donors and multilateral economic institutions for support of our national efforts. The resolve that sow exists within the international community to address the twin problems of environment and development within a multilateral framework is consistent with the prevailing spirit to tackle the common problems facing mankind through international co-operation. It is our expectation that the 1992 Brazil Conference will result in a set of measures and commitments which will provide the basis for future co-operative actions in preserving our common goals. Zimbabwe is of the view that any measures aimed at assisting developing countries in protecting their environment should be directed more at the revitalisation of their growth and development than at merely addressing the symptoms of the problem.Another major gap that needs to be closed in order to sustain the current positive international political climate is in the area of disarmament. While initial steps have been taken towards a real seduction of the nuclear armaments of the two super-Powers after the signing of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles  known as the INF Treaty. mankind has not yet been freed from the fear of the threat of nuclear annihilation. The threat posed by the remaining huge arsenals of nuclear weapons and the apparent unwillingness of the nuclear Powers to abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence contain serious risks undermining the prevailing positive international climate.We are encouraged by the progress made in the search among countries of the East and the West for an open-skies agreement. Zimbabwe is of the view that the confidence emanating from such an agreement would greatly contribute to the current relaxation of international tensions. For such confidence to be general and shared by all States  however  it is preferable that capabilities for taking advantage of the resulting transparency should be commonly shared. The bloc politics that had paralysed the Security Council are fast becoming a phenomenon of the past  and that body is apparently now in a position to play the role originally envisaged for it in the Charter. It is our hope that the new partnership in the Security Council will not result in that body's being used as a tool to promote and further only the interests of the powerful at the expense of those of the weak. To this end  we expect that the Council shall all the time function in a responsible and objective manner in all cases in safeguarding the rule of law in international relations and the principles and purposes of the Charter.Let me conclude by expressing the hope that at last the walls which separated the act-ions of Member States from the ideals and objectives of the United Nations Charter have also given way to a new United Nations  committed  in the words of the Charter  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war...  ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person...  ""to establish conditions under which justice and ... international law can be maintained  and ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". "
